I need to put my hands on Jennifer
Gives me heaven and hell, she’s my Lucifer

[Verse 1: PLVTINUM]
Shiver when I see her silhouette
I’m fuckin’ terrified but I’m obsessed with her
Kiss me tastes like sin and cigarette (Cigarette)
She’s the devil wearing Prada and Hermes

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Grey]
She’s out for revenge
My baby, she’s out for revenge, ah
Her hands ‘round my neck (‘Round my nеck)
Fuck around and you might just be next

[Chorus: Chris Grey, PLVTINUM, Chris Grey & PLVTINUM]
I need to put my hands on Jennifеr
Everybody runs away but I run to her
Gives me heaven and hell, she’s my Lucifer
No one’s made it out alive but I’ll be the first (I'd die for her)
When I die, dig a grave, put my name
Next to hers
I need to put my hands on Jennifer (Yeah)
On Jennifer’s body, Jennifer’s body
You might also like[Verse 2: Dutch Melrose]
That body talk and she 10 out of 10
She on the prowl and I might be up next
Goin’ turn it up until she drippin’ wet
The devil called and she out for revenge
Jenny’s on the block, fuck a cop car
Ain’t no slowin’ down
I’ll take my last breath as a rockstar
If she come around
(Imma fuck her or I’ll die trying)

[Chorus: Chris Grey, PLVTINUM, Chris Grey & PLVTINUM]
I need to put my hands on Jennifer
Everybody runs away but I run to her
Gives me heaven and hell, she’s my Lucifer
No one’s made it out alive but I’ll be the first (I'd die for her)
When I die, dig a grave, put my name
Next to hers
I need to put my hands on Jennifer (Yeah)
On Jennifer’s body, Jennifer’s body

[Outro: PLVTINUM & Chris Grey]
Shiver when I see her silhouette
On Jennifer’s body, Jennifer’s body (I’m fuckin’ terrified but I’m obsessed with her)
Kiss me tastes like sin and cigarette
She’s the devil wearing Prada and Hermes
She’s out for revenge (Shiver when I see her silhouette)
My baby she’s out for revenge, ah (I’m fuckin’ terrified but I’m obsessed with her)
Her hands ‘round my neck (Kiss me tastes like sin and cigarette)
Fuck around and you might just be next (Might just be next)
