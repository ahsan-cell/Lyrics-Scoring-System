Off of the drank and off of the drugs
I feel like I'm in slow-mo
Glad that you came, let out all the pain
I'm sorry for your sorrow

[Refrain]
(Oh) Let-let, let it go
Don't, don't face it
Let-let, let it go
Don't, don't, don't face it
Let it go
Don't, don't face it
Let-let, let it go
Don't, don't, don't face it

[Pre-Chorus]
Rage, love, lust, on fire
Rage, love, lust, on fire

[Chorus]
Forgive me for breaking my promise, I'm sorry
Forgive me for breaking my promise, I'm sorry
I'm heartless, I'm nobody, I feel like I'm Roxas
Th-that's why I o-only stick around them girls that's toxic
