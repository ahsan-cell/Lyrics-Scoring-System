Y-Y-You're now listening to Camp Vamps Radio, b-b-bitch

[Chorus]
Sippin' blood like I'm a vampire
Taste like codeine, drippin' on me
Masquerade, now where's the coke line?
Playing bloodlines, where's that clap back?
Feel like Dracula, way I scare you
Cry for help but I can't hear you
Now you part of my blood omen
Getting high off serotonin
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Catch your skin right on my fang
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Soon you'll know what is my name
Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade
Mortal souls is what I crave

[Verse]
Seek them out now, one by one
Droppin' bodies like a nun
Two twin Glocks, name Bonnie and Clyde
Slide through roofs like I'm Tom Cruise
I think I'm fine, please just leave
Walk around like I can't see
I'm fly like a bat, can track your tracks
They see my face, get a heart attack
You might also like[Chorus]
Sippin' blood like I'm a vampire
Taste like codeine, drippin' on me
Masquerade, now where's the coke line?
Playing bloodlines, where's that clap back?
Feel like Dracula, way I scare you
Cry for help but I can't hear you
Now you part of my blood omen
Getting high off serotonin
Sippin' blood like I'm a vampire
Taste like codeine, drippin' on me
Masquerade, now where's the coke line?
Playing bloodlines, where's that clap back?
Feel like Dracula way I scare you
Cry for help but I can't hear you
Now you part of my blood omen
Getting high off serotonin

[Bridge]
Sioux, get it together
I'm losing my mental
They talking about you
They planning to use you
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
I feel it deep within
It's just beneath the skin
I must confess that I feel like a monster
[Chorus]
Sippin' blood like I'm a vampire
Taste like codeine, drippin' on me
Masquerade, now where's the coke line?
Playing bloodlines, where's that clap back?
Feel like Dracula, way I scare you
Cry for help but I can't hear you
Now you part of my blood omen
Getting high off serotonin
Sippin' blood like I'm a vampire
Taste like codeine, drippin' on me
Masquerade, now where's the coke line?
Playing bloodlines, where's that clap back?
Feel like Dracula, way I scare you
Cry for help but I can't hear you
Now you part of my blood omen
