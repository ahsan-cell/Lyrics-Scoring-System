We started war, tear this place right back down to the floor
Ain't shit gon’ hold us, break down all these doors
We started war, tear this place right back down to the floor
Ain't shit gon' hold us, break down all these doors

[Drop]

[Refrain]
Fuck the system, get yo’ money
Fuck the Matrix
Fuck the club, tear it up
Kick the door down
Fuck the system, get yo' money
Fuck the Matrix
Fuck the club, tear it up
Kick the door—

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop your nonsense
You don't need nobody-y-y
Why don't you talk to me?
Really miss your body
You really naughty
I don't love that bitch
She just deep inside me
She's so naughty
You might also like[Chorus]
Wе started war, tear this place right back down to thе floor
Ain't shit gon' hold us, break down all these doors
We started war, tear this place right back down to the floor
Ain’t shit gon’ hold us, break down all these doors

[Drop]

[Refrain]
Fuck the system, get yo' money
Fuck the Matrix
Fuck the club, tear it up
Kick the door down
Fuck the system, get yo’ money
Fuck the Matrix
Fuck the club, tear it up
Kick the door—

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop your nonsense
You don't need nobody-y-y
Why don't you talk to me?
Really miss your body
You really naughty
I don't love that bitch
She just deep inside me
She’s so naughty
[Outro]
We started war, tear this place right back down to the floor
Ain't shit gon' hold us, break down all these doors
We started war, tear this place right back down to the floor
Ain't shit gon' hold us, break down all these doors1
