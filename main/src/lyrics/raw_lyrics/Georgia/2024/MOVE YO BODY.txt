(W4ddles' you genius!)

[Verse 1]
W4ddles made the beat
I ain't come to mess around
Think I got a bounty, I'm the baddest in my town
LBJ, walk around with a crown
'Bout to pop off, matter of fact, get down
Can't participate, I'll attract a whole crowd
Went up bein' me, I done made my momma proud
If it's me and a baddie, It might get a little loud
Just gotta let you know, heads up (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Move yo' body, come move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, come move yo' body
Come move yo' body, come move yo' body

[Verse 2]
First of all, let's go to work (What else?)
Back it up, hop in reverse
She'll eat it up for a berk
And then still leave some room for dessert
Girl, try not to move your body
I put in work like a colleague (Ah)
She popped a squat like an Ollie (What else? Ah)
Then things got totally gnarly (Yeah)
So hottie, Like Scotty (Yeah)
Want to party all night like Miley (Yeah)
Say she like bad boys, Mike Lowry (Yeah)
Watch me put her on cam, iCarly (Yeah)
I like ranch, but I'm stackin' blue cheese (Yeah)
It's not a person who could stop me, Wemby (Yeah)
I don't fear no man, just test me (Yeah)
Gather up the whole gang like One Piece (Yeah)
You might also like[Chorus]
Move yo' body, come move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, move yo' body
Move yo' body, come move yo' body
Come move yo' body, come move yo' body

[Outro]
Coming in yeah, he coming in (Go)
Coming in yeah, he— (Body)
Pat, pat, pat, pat, tap, tap (Yuh)
Pat, pat, pat, pat— (Body)
What you working with, girl, what you working with? (Huh?)
What you working with, girl, what you— (Body)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, turn up (Let's go)
All I wanna see you dance, so turn up (Let's go)
