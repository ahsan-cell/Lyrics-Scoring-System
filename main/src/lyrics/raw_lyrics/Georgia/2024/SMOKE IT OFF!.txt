(You're listening to Lumi Athena radio
And, we love all you pretty girls)

[Verse 1: jnhygs & Yumi Kakazu]
When I throw it up, watch it all fall down
I can turn a smile into a frown
Smoke it up, roll it up, let's go
Life is way easier when I'm on a roll
Talk to me, baby, I can't let go
You done stole me, you stole my soul
You done stole me, you stole my soul
You done stole me, you stole my soul (Bye-bye!)

[Chorus: jnhygs & Yumi Kakazu]
I said, "Stop, I can't let go"
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
(Bye-bye)

[Refrain: jnhygs]
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah

I live in my— I live in my dreams and I live in my nightmares
I live in my dreams— I live in my— I live in my—
I live in my dreams and I live in my nightmares
I live in my dreams— I live in my— I live in my—
You want to fight but you know we don't fight fair
You want to fight but you know we don't—
Y-Y-You want to fight but you know we don't fight fair
You want to fight but you know we don't fight fair

[Verse 2: cade clair & Yumi Kakazu]
I live in my—
I live in my dreams, and I live in my nightmares
You wanna fight, but you know we don't fight fair
Everybody wants smoke until they get steamed
She say she love me, whatever that means
All this fake love, I know you a groupie
I-I-I get hoes and pass them to Lumi
I heard your music, it do not move me
Your head got big, I'd think you was Stewie
You beggin' me to stop, I show no mercy
Shakin' her hips, I thought she was from Jersey
"Aren't you the guys from KURXXED?"
No, I'm the nigga that'll put you in dirt today (Bye-bye)
Please don't get me started
Lumi said he got the pole in his skirt today
Why you runnin' away?
I swear, I do not play
[Chorus: jnhygs]
I said, "Stop, I can't let go"
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, really got me down, yeah

[Outro: Yumi Kakazu]
