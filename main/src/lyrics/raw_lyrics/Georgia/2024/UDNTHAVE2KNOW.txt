[Verse 1:]
You don’t have to know but you’re my baby
Oh, you don’t have to know, but you drive me crazy
Driving me crazy I'm up the wall
Driving me crazy I don’t know at all

[Chorus:]
(You don’t have to know know)
(You don’t have to know know)
(You don’t have to know know)
(You don’t have to know know)
Tell me if it’s too much
Tell me if it’s too much
You don’t have to know, know
You don’t have to know, know

[Verse 2:]
Tell me something (Tell me something)
Are you even winning? (Even winning?)
This supposed to be your (Be your)
Your new beginning (Your new beginning)
Tell me you want so (Tell me)
Tell me you want so
(Tell me want so) To keep up for when you lose your brain
(Tell me what you want)
So I can keep it ..

At the end of the day, you’re just a kid
You make it clear, the way you is
At the end of the day, you’re just a kid
At the end of the day, you’re just a
Dumb kid
