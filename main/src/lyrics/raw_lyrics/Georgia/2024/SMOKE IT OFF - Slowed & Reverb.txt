When I throw it up, watch it all fall down
I can turn a smile into a frown
Smoke it up, roll it up, let's go
Life is way easier when I'm on a roll
Talk to me, baby, I can't let go
You done stole me, you stole my soul
You done stole me, you stole my soul
You done stole me, you stole my soul
(Bye-bye)

[Refrain: jnhygs & Yumi Kakazu]
I said, "Stop, I can't let go"
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
(Bye-bye)

[Chorus: jnhygs]
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah

Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah
Break it down, yeah, break it down, yeah
Too much, too much, oh, yeah

[Verse 2: jnhygs & Yumi Kakazu]
I see you tryin' to hang with the gang, yeah
Bad lil' bitch, she like the glises on my chain, yeah
I heard you was talking, right? This, here and there, yeah
I heard you was talking, right? I heard you was talking, right?
Let's party, let's party
You're tardy to the party
Let's smoke it up, let's roll it up
We party 'til we die, yeah
(Bye-bye)
I like hanging with crazy fans
Crazy fan like takin' off they pants
That lean got me like, "Ooh"
They singing my song like, "Ooh"

[Refrain: jnhygs & Yumi Kakazu]
I said, "Stop, I can't let go"
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
You really got my soul untold
Stop, I can't let go
You really got me down, you really got me down
Stop, I can't let go
