Senk, pop it up
Sonic boom

[Pre-Chorus: SpongeOpp]
Yeah, I just popped a bean, watch my eyes grow
Sippin' hella lean, smokin' hydro (Yeah)
When I hit the reef, turn it tidal
Gary is my shadow, bitch, he go wherever I go

[Chorus: Gary, Mr. Swags, The Notorious P.A.T & Squidwock]
(Meow, meow, meow) Ha, Gary hit 'em with the—
(Meow, meow, meow) Ha, Gary hit 'em with the—
(Meow, meow, meow) Ha, Gary hit 'em with the—
Meow, meow, meow (Ah-ah)

[Verse 1: SpongeOpp & Squidwock]
Hey Squiddy, my bro, I'm back
Okay, let's get in that bag
We spinnin' that block for Krabs
Let's see if that mech bitch gags

[Verse 2: The Notorious P.A.T.]
Let's see if she choked on dick
VVS on both my wrist
I was in thе Chum Bucket
Now I'm outin' on my city

Hit that bitch with a Glock emoji, turned Dank into guacamolе
Can't hurt me, I'm with my OGs, can't nerf me, Sandy OP (Ha, yeah)
Told them, “Rest in piss”, where the pack at?
They want it so bad, they've been asking, “Where the Krab at?”

[Verse 4: Mr. Swags]
Oh, that's me
Gunna on my hip, fuck you mean?
Ridin' in a chopper with my team

[Bridge: Mr. Swags]
Oh, no, me boy, see? You've done it now
You are fucked

[Pre-Chorus: SpongeOpp]
Yeah, I just popped a bean, watch my eyes grow
Sippin' hella lean, smokin' hydro (Yeah)
When I hit the reef, turn it tidal
Gary is my shadow, bitch, he go wherever I go

[Chorus: Gary, Mr. Swags, The Notorious P.A.T & Squidwock]
(Meow, meow, meow) Ha, Gary hit 'em with the—
(Meow, meow, meow) Ha, Gary hit 'em with the—

Meow, meow, meow (Ooh, ah-ah)
[Verse 5: Squidwock]
I'm a stone-faced killer, like my motherfuckin' house is
Diamonds hit the do-si-do, and smack it where your mouth is
Heard they want a solo, I can't do that 'til we out this
Grab my clarinet and smoke them oppas by the ounces (Haha)
My trigger finger fast, Ramadan
I'm addicted to this cash, I want it all
Let the chopper blow his back, bend him over, said, “Relax”
Put some lead up in his ass, still hetero (Ha-ha-ha)

[Verse 6: Mr. Swags, SpongeOpp, The Notorious P.A.T. & Squidwock]
You know the crab like money
You know the sponge like fun
Know the star keeps shining
Know the squid likes guns

[Verse 7: Sandy Thee Squirrel]
What we all got in common
When this shit's said and done
Is a dead fuckin' roach
And a city that we—

[Pre-Chorus: SpongeOpp & Sandy Thee Squirrel]
Yeah, (Run), I just popped a bean, watch my eyes grow
Sippin' hella lean, smokin' hydro (Yeah)
When I hit the reef, turn it tidal
Gary is my shadow, bitch, he go wherever I go
[Chorus: Gary, Mr. Swags, The Notorious P.A.T & Squidwock]

Meow, meow, meow (Ooh, ooh, ah-ah)5
