Ah yeah, testin', one two, one two
This a lil' something for you, you lil' biatch

[Chorus]
Watch my 9mm go bang
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang
Watch my 9mm go bang
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang

[Verse]
Player haters, masturbators, bitches all up in my shit
Living scared, you know you dead, walkin' around with a crippled leg
That bitch boy tried to test my shit, fucking with the wrizong click
M-A-G-N-O-L-I-A, that is where yo' ass will lay
You player haters on my dick, tryin' to put me in a click
I'll buck you twice, I'll buck one more
All you cowards hit the floor
These jealous fellas in a gang knowing that they ass is lame
Big-ass smile, but still as lame
You got a Glock? Then buck me, bitch
When that smoke is in my nose, I be wantin' to kidnap hoes
Talkin' shit about Da Click? You gon' get yo ass kicked
I hop out my fuckin' ride, and put my Glock to yo sidе
Lockin' the fucking trunk, and then I'll hit that blunt
Now–

Watch my 9mm go bang
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang
Watch my 9mm go bang
Wa-da-da-dang, wa-da-da-da-dang

This a lil' something for you, you lil' biatch
