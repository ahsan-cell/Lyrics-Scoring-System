Part XIV: Kelela - Contact

[Verse 1: Kelela]
We're takin' a ride, 405 through the west side
We're party to party, it's late but we're wide awake
The bass in my body, I'm sinkin', it's so wide
Time is surreal, now I'm floating in outer space

[Pre-Chorus: Kelela]
Rollin' up, we bring in the light
It might just render you blind
We're workin' hard every day
Don't need your help, I can pay
You're stressin', that's not allowed
There's nothin' holdin' us down
You see my hips and they sway
Now, see me walkin' away to the dance floor

[Chorus: Kelela]
Oh, it's a sauna, here if you wanna (I'm standin' in the light)
It's 2 AM, yeah, we made it, everybody faded (So high, so high, so high)
And now I'm floatin' away, far and away (You know it feels so right)
You tryna stall and delay, but I wanna play

[Outro: Kelela]
I wanna play— I wanna play— I wanna play— I wanna play—
I wanna play— I wanna play— I wanna play— I wanna play—
I wanna play— I wanna play— I wanna play— I wanna play—

Part XXII: ​Jane Remover - Census Designated / The Weeknd - The Morning

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
