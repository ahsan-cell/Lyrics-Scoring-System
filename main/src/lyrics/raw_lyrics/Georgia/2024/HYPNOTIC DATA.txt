[Verse]
Girl (Uh-uh, u-uh)
If you ain't notice, this my world (Uh-uh-uh, uh, uh)
There's still a lot you gotta lear-ear-ear-ear-ear-ear-earn-earn
What's mine is hers-er-er-er-er-er-er—
Everythin' I got, I worked my ass off, I deserve it
Bitch, I'm not yo' fuckin' buddy (Uh-uh)
She like, "I think I recognize you"
Bitch, I ain't nobody (Uh-uh, uh)
You can keep all the shit that you wearin', we already know that it's fake
Ain't nobody impressed by the shit that you playin'
How they hatin' on me, but they look like they lame?
How they actin' like that and they don't got a name? (They don't got a— don't got a—)
