[Outro]
'Sup homeboy, it's Ryan, uh… just callin' to say what's up
I am working, I've been working, back to panic
And I'm working 'til next week
Um, sorry I didn't call you back sooner, but
Uh, I was just callin' to say hi, see how things are goin'
But we gotta do something soon, I know we've been sayin' that, but we do
Uh, hope you're all good, I'll talk to you… later
Peace...14
