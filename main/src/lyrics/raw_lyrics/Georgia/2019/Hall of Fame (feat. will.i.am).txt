Spaceman

Raybans
Watches (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Spaceman, rocket
Raybans, watches
Jungle, toxic
Fumble, lost it
Rumble, johnson
New song, drop it
Honour, homage
Doctor, stoppage

[Verse 1: M.O.E]
Out of this world, yeah, I'm not from this planet
Alien language, they don't understand it
Scary invasion, I'm causing a panic
UFO whip, and the drip is Atlantic
Galaxy lean and the pot is ceramic
Abra Kadabra, my haters will vanish
Yellowish skin but the bitch is Hispanic
Fixing yo' problems, I'm like a mechanic
New phone, number change
Jungle chain, lion mane
Money makes the rich insane
Brand new whip, I'm switching lanes
In thе clouds, like I'm a plane
Looks like nothing was thе same
Writing heat inside the rain
Bulletproof, but feeling pain
Listen to M.O.E so I get in the groove
Hop in the bed, come and show me your moves
I'm spitting heat but you say that I'm cool
Shining so bright like I'm flexing my jewels
Not looking back like I'm forward parking
Going bananas, I'm Mario Karting
Multiple snakes go and hide in the garden
Astronaut suit while I deal with the Martians

Spaceman, rocket (Okay)
Raybans, watches (Yeah, okay)
Jungle, toxic (Oh-yeah, okay)
Fumble, lost it (Oh-yeah, okay)
Rumble, johnson (Oh-yeah, okay)
New song, drop it (Oh-yeah, okay)
Honour, homage (Oh-yeah, okay)
Doctor, stoppage (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lascels]
You are not welcome in the clique
Oats, M.O.E, and Lascels on the beat, then it's lit
I feel like Travis 'cause it's lit (Uh-huh), I'm a dog with no ticks
I always wanted a rollie 'cause those things never tick
I feel like rick I'ma kinda slick, I'm like Karate when I kick
I shoot buckets, you shoot bricks, NBA, I'm first pick
Just like Rick Flair, I got the drip
We gon' be in the Hall of Fame like Will.I.am and The Script
I'm like PG 'cause when I'm dunkin' you are always getting clipped
I dye my hair like a Super Saiyan
She get on her knees but she ain't been prayin'
Here's the bill cause you know that I ain't paying
I'll pay half, I'm just playing, I ain't paying
You is gullible, feel like Remble 'cause you I ain't touchable
I ain't human that means I'm indestructible
Bars of steel, so you know they ain't cuttable
Bars are fire, so you know they're combustible
I'm running this beat, no, you cannot compete
I be spitting the fire, so I'm spitting the heat
If it's too much to handle, then you can retreat
I won't stand for the bullshit, so I take a seat
It's just me and the gang, so, it's me and the fleet
And your music is trash, I think you should delete
I'm going hard and it's only a feat
I am the code and I'm finna go cheat
