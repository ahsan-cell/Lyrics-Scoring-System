[Chorus: Young Adz]
Eight in the palm, self-obsessed
Now she want some more, legs open
Took her to Dior
Shoulda went A Jewellers, get your diamonds pure
Said she wanna fuck a drug dealer
Selling crack but I smoke reefer
Yeah, playin' chess on my Louis V cah I'm bored
Baby, we might fuck but I don't need ya

[Verse 1: Dirtbike LB, Young Adz]
I keep thinkin' 'bout the pussy just before I crash the Porsche
I'ma eat that pussy, baby, you ain't gotta talk
If you want the bag, baby, suck my dick before
I spent too much bands in Dior
With the AP plain, cost me 30K
Girl, I hate it when that love's feelin' strange
Paid cash for the car, that's the Range
If I ever said "I love you" then I think I've gone insane (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Young Adz]
Nigga run off with some grub, we woulda run it back
Long story short, made the boy do the running man
Huh, made sure he paid back
Three litres of blood, swapped it for couple grand
Told her that I don't even get high (Hahaha)
Should have saw her face when I crushed a Xan
CC head to toe, I'm fly
Every bitch wanna fuck a man
You might also like[Chorus: Young Adz]
Eight in the palm, self-obsessed
Now she want some more, legs open
Took her to Dior
Shoulda went A Jewellers, get your diamonds pure
Said she wanna fuck a drug dealer (Dealer)
Selling crack but I smoke reefa (Reefa)
Yeah, playin' chess on my Louis V cah I'm bored
Baby, we might fuck but I don't need ya

[Verse 3: Krept, Konan]
Give her good dick, now she well glad (Woo, woo)
Beat the pussy up, that's a health haz' (Skrrt, skrrt)
West End shoppin' in Chanel (Chanel)
Fuck me right, I'll get you the Chanel bags
Bonjour, come in on contour
True, true, see the view on the top floor
In Dior, in Dior like I'm sponsored (Woo)
Mm-hmm, can I get an encore? (Sorcerer)

[Verse 4: Konan]
Tall gyal haffi take heels off (Off)
Bare squats but your bum still soft (Nasty)
Netflix and Chill but we never chill
Looks like Zara but it's seven bills
Dolce Gabbana
Where she get her weave? Alibaba (Hahahahaha)
Where she wanna eat? Benihana
Good gyal but she got her eyes on my 'nana (Behave)
[Chorus: Young Adz, Deno]
Eight in the palm, self-obsessed
Now she want some more, legs open
Took her to Dior
Shoulda went A Jewellers, get your diamonds pure
Said she wanna fuck a drug dealer (Dealer)
Selling crack but I smoke reefa (Reefa)
Yeah, playin' chess on my Louis V cah I'm bored
Baby, we might fuck but I don't need ya (Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet)

[Verse 5: Deno & Young Adz]
Said she wanna F a drug dealer
But, baby, I wasn't raised in the trap (Trap, oh)
If that's what you want 'cause you know that money long (Ski, ski, ski, ski)
Just know that I got it like that (Oh-oh-oh)
Bro was in the bando I was in the booth
With the same guys, we bunnin' the same zoot (Ooh)
I was in the studio grafting, not the T-house
So how could I be at a freak's house?

[Chorus: Young Adz]
Eight in the Palm, self-obsessed
Now she want some more, legs open
Took her to Dior
Shoulda went A Jewellers, get your diamonds pure
Said she wanna fuck a drug dealer (Dealer)
Selling crack but I smoke reefa (Reefa)
Yeah, playin' chess on my Louis V, cah I'm bored
Baby, we might fuck but I don't need ya (Skeet, skeet, skeet, skeet)
