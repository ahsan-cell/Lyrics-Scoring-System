Tweakin', tweakin'
One-twenty on the M-way, speedin'
LV hat, backpack, and sneakers
Any girl that I'm with is a ten
Nine, eight, bredrin, decent
Now I'm in a party with the sweetest
Chocolate brownin', Reese's Pieces
I'm tweakin', tweakin'
One-twenty on the M-way, speedin'
LV hat, backpack, and sneakers
Any girl that I'm with is a ten
Nine, eight, bredrin, decent
Now I'm in a party with the sweetest
Chocolate brownin', Reese's Pieces
[Verse 1]
My brudda got a new wristwatch
But don't watch that 'cause you could get
You could get nauseous, could get seasick
I mean, all of my ex-girls hate me
But how you gonna have my baby, baby?
Don't you know I'm livin' that, baby boy?
Lifestyle, everyting crazy
If you don't chat to your guy, your G'll see
I ain't talkin' Mercedes, nah
Let's talk 'bout drama
I got a peng brownin' in my zone
And I'm in the zone too like Karma
Man, pull up, hop out, pull over
If it's palava, cool, say nada
Now I'm in a party with Tara
And that girl got body like armour
Football in Balenciagas
Or I kickball in my all-black Pradas
No actin', never went RADA
I'm a top boy like Sully but darker
Hahaha, what's the drama?
Peng tings still get aired
Left on read then blue like Barça
If it ain't about face, don't dial me
If it ain't about face, won't answer
I got a brownin' livin' in Sydenham
Professor X 'cause, true say, the back ain't there
But the brain is brilliant
And my new ting came with kids
And that's okay 'cause I am still dickin' it
Little man wanna jump on FIFA
So I'm close to the sun like Icarus
Whitewash man then I'm back in the room with his marge
Tryna whitewash that for the thrill of it
No bareback, man gotta jimmy it
Backside jigglin', shakin', ripplin'
And her neck just ticklin'
Tryna hide my face cah I can't stop gigglin'
Them man all hickory dickory
Watch glistenin' but the Rollie tickin', it's
It's, it's such a shame
You might also like[Chorus]
Tweakin', tweakin'

[Interlude]
Man around that were snitches
They're not around no more
They're not around no more
And who do you think that's because of?

[Verse 2]
Was it us that got a man movin'? Ah, don't be stupid
No bumper, wah di bumba?
New number, hit her back like, "Who's this?"
Cucumber in her belly like a broomstick, huh
R8 or the Lamborghini?
Them man there don't plan to see me
Cah my niggas on greaze like Santorini
I've got a brown-skin girl from Bush
That will take that charge on the chest if I say so
Both hands on her wig while I hit from the back
Got me pullin' on her tracks and cane rows
Two man in a Superdry jacket and new Astra
Man, it's lookin' like plain clothes
We ain't never had halos
Just Henny and Jenny from the block, no J.Lo
This year here is gonna be a mad one
I need a good girl, I need a bad one
I need a brand new vest and a handgun
Them man need that more than a man does
Them man need cash more than a man does
Them man been crashed more than a man, look
You don't wanna end up in my bad books
It's not a good look givin' man a bad look
[Chorus]
Tweakin', tweakin'
One-twenty on the M-way, speedin'
LV hat, backpack, and sneakers
Any girl that I'm with is a ten
Nine, eight, bredrin, decent
Now I'm in a party with the sweetest
Chocolate brownin', Reese's Pieces
[Outro]
Ayy, what 'bout you anyway?
What 'bout your love life?
It's a good question, man
Wouldn't mind havin' a bit of fun if I'm being honest6
