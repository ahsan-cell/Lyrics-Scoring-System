​uoy evol I, sdrow rehto nI

[Chorus: Dave]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 1: Dave]
I do know my man, but I don't trust him
Trust that, P's in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public
South London where I made my
South London's where I made my first hundred
Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion
In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
Nuff pollution in the ends, I flew back yard cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrеan, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress
I know dem man talk on the kid, but
You might also like[Chorus: Dave]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 2: Dave]
Any girl that I'm datin' knows
Bags that I buy come filled with fifties
She a ten out of ten on a bad day
Public affection, I tell her, "Come kiss me"
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery
G17 in the party, tipsy
Don't drink, that's risky
Focus, shells gonna land like Disney
I'll put him down under, Sydney
That's bae, I'll donate both my kidneys
True love, what the kid needs
And a girl from the Westest Indies
I know dem man talk on the kid, but
[Chorus: Dave]
It's hard to hate on the truth I'm livin' in
Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on the private jet
Life or death, five-five
Eyes, thighs, potential wifey
Industry, respected highly
In the street, protected

[Verse 3: Dave]
In this world that I'm in
How you wanna take pics with the belts in the ring
But don't help in the gym?
Nuff girls datin' their biggest haters, how her boyfriend don't want her to win?
Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Yeah, yeah (Fly-fly me to the moon)
Fly me to the moon, let me get some space
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace (Let me see what spring is like on Jupiter, Jupiter)
See her ex man, she got no taste, hip dip, she got no waist
Body snatched, servin' face (In other words, hold my hand)
Haha, hold my hand, personal trainer
Frequent flyer, bad, she toned and tan (In other words, darlin', kiss me)
Free my gang, 013's and 020's
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
[Outro: Ree Paramagita]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words, please be true
In other words, I love you
In other words, I love you33
