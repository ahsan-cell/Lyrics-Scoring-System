We were just kids playing in the rain
When you threw a stone
And you broke a window pane
You were so afraid of what you done
That I held your hand little one
And I wouldn't let you run, oh
Yo

[Verse 1: Strandz]
Like, I like the way that you're movin' around me
I went fully lidge on the day that you found me
I know you see the killers and dealers around me
But I grew up with gorillas, you know how the wild be
Grew up in the ghetto, destined for a celly
I would hustle heavy, tryna be a lеgendary
But I got mon chéri, Julio Don Peri', pricey boss lady
I givе you old-school lovin' like we in the 80s
I know your friends hate me, but they just wanna love me
I put you over money, higher when we sober
And we higher than a stoner
I'ma slide when it's over cah we die for the closure
I mean

[Chorus: Strandz]
It's us against the world
Us against the ghetto
Us against the police
Us against this hell (Hole)
Damn, I love you girl (Ohh)
Baby, can't you tell?
I ain't hit another sale
I ain't bought another shell

I'm on a very dark road, can you show me the light?
I'm the man, I should be the one that's holding you tight
But understand my paranoia is getting worse at night
Cold sweats, I can't sleep, I need you by my side
But I got errands that I gotta run, get ready if you wanna come
My Kia, bags of washing and I'm dropping them off to my mum
Fill my car with petrol, it's not diesel, use the other pump
I knew from when I seen you, you ain't nothing like the other ones
Just billing up some weed, so we can control the steering with my knees
I look at you and smile and see you staring back at me
You make me feel at ease, I'm kinda stressed so be my peace
I really wanna leave, I hate it here, let's go to Greece
Wait, we can go to Paris bae, but I like it in central Pait
I know you never heard of it, but this is where the riches stay
I don't care what you say, I'm still gonna grip it in the States
They know we gripping DXB, I left it five palm tip

[Chorus: Strandz]
It's us against the world
Us against the ghetto
Us against the police
Us against this hell (Hole)
Damn, I love you girl (Ohh)
Baby, can't you tell?
I ain't hit another sale
I ain't bought another shell
