Ladies and Gentlemen, we’ve got a special treat for you tonight
I’m gonna call my friend Olly up here to sing to you ladies
Olly!
Let’s go man

[Verse 1]
My name is Olly, nice to meet you, can I tell you baby?
Look around, there’s a whole lot of pretty ladies
But none like you, you shine so bright, yeah
I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute
On the floor up close gettin' lost in it
I won’t give up without a fight

[Chorus]
I just wanna, oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on, oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight

[Verse 2]
We’re getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now
Loosen up and let you hands go down, down
Go with it girl, yeah, just close your eyes, yeah
I feel the music moving through your body
Lookin' at you, I can tell you want me
Don’t stop, keep going till the morning light, yeah
When I saw you there
Sittin' all alone in the dark acting like you didn’t have a care
I knew right then, that you’d be mine
And we’d be dancin' the whole damn night right

Now bring it all back
To dance with me tonight

[Chorus]
I just wanna, oh baby
I just want you to dance with me tonight
Everybody, everybody, come on now
Girl, just close your eyes
We can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight
And everybody sing
Girl, just close your eyes (Oh baby)
We can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on girl, just close your eyes
We can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight12
