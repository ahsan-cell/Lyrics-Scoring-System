Know I've done wrong
I left your heart torn
Is that what devils do?
Took you so low
Where only fools go
I shook the angel in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

[Chorus]
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?

[Verse 2]
It's unforgivable
I stole and burnt your soul
Is that what demons do?
They rule the worst of me
Destroy everything
They bring down angels like you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm rising from the ground
Rising up to you
Filled with all the strength I found
There's nothing I can't do

[Chorus]
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
(Can you love me again?)
Can you love me again?

[Bridge]
I told you once, I can't do this again
Do this again, oh lord
I told you once, I can't do this again
Do this again, oh no

[Chorus]
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
Can you love me again?
I need to know now, know now
(Can you love me again?)
(Can you love me again?)
Can you love me again?
Can you love me again?88
