Hey wena jou snaai
Ntse ke le shebile le gooi'a di skemp
Le tletse tshele mara ha lena niks
Ne le nagana le tla fella kae, heh?
Hayi voetsek!
Nxa, banna!

[Hook]
Kgale bare ba tlo re fetsa
Ha re ba bone ba kae
Bane bare ba itshosetsa
Ha re ba bone ba kae
Bona rona mo releng teng
Ha re ba bone ba kae
All I see is me and my cheques
Ha re ba bone ba kae

[Verse 1]
I do it for my best friend mama (hey mom)
I do it for my best friend Kgala (hey friend)
Through the bullshit re di tsala (ey!)
Ha kena stress no drama
Ha ke mo dilong ke ya ithata
Bona mo dilong ba itlatsa
Ha re le dilong ba ipatla
Ha kena ditlhong ke tla go klapa
I'm a lady looking all proper
Look at all the gigs I'm popping (what else?)
Everybody already talking
I ain't gonna change no topic
Soon as I drop they bought it
Bitches all talking boring, yawning
When do y'all work, to be honest? Ey!
Cause I stack racks I get paid all the time
I backchat I don't waste anytime
Dead that talk you look very alive
(Swipe swipe swipe)
I don't ever decline
(Swipe swipe swipe)
It'll never decline
Look at that belt on my waist when I wind
Tanqueray called me and begged me to sign
I got a sissy boy deal
I would never decline
(Bare wa thwasa mara, bona o rata strata wa mmona)
Mirror Mirror on the wall
Ha ba thlaloganye ka ipona
Look at my whip it's foreign
Look at my nigga, he foreign
Look at that beach it's foreign
Fuck a location, bona!

[Verse 2]
Look, I don't want beef I want competition
I just want to see if you're really widdit
How many bags is you really getting
How many of them got a Louis V in?
How many them is getting seizures
As soon as they see some Peruvians
I would rather fight for all these millions
And we might all end up with every million
Drop one record and you niggas turn into bitches
Now you wanna have a conversation about the lyrics?
I don't ever listen cause I'm all about the business
All about the digits
I don't worry about the critics
Ask any ex , he ain't tell you any different
I'm on on a jet if you think about trippin
I'm from Potch on a world wide mission
My impulse got every little girl winning
Yeses!
I broke the ceiling and then got at their limits (skrrrt, skrrrt, skrrrt)
Don't wanna son you, I want my own children
Bitch!
My dream was to rap, now you get to live it
Tell all the haters I'm in it to win it
Ain't nobody quitting, now shut up and listen
