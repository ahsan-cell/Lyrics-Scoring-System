[Verse 1]
Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors
The flow house of horror, dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch, six sense with a nose drip
Mind skydive, sniffing bumps in the cockpit
Locksmith of hip-hop, appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size as the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic, prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends 'cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift
Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit
Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in
Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life, seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment
Funny how it happens who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it?

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time, make trees, take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket, savage with bad habits
Broke, serving fiends, got rich, became a addict
Ain't it funny how it happens, who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?
Managed to somehow to have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering
Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it, ain't it funny how it happens?
No way to mask it, a lot became has beens
Rolling up that hundred dollar bill till they cash in
Thinks it gone last, going too fast
Man, it's fucked up, ain't it funny how it happens?

Ain't it funny how it happens?

[Verse 3]
Ain't it funny how it happens? Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down 'cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
It's a living nightmare, that most of us might share
Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to, tell you what I'm gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems with this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies
Might need rehab but to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y'all 'cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8-ball of coke and my nigga on the way
Got three hoes with him and they all tryna play
Ain't it funny how it happ— who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing?

[Chorus]
Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?

[Part II: "Grown Up"]

[Intro]
Yuh

[Verse 1]
Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then we thought we growed up
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yah

[Chorus]
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yah
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
Yah
*scratches*

[Verse 2]
I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga's sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man they wetter than the everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, it's me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Nigga catch a heart attack, Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up

[Chorus]
Yah
Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yah
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
Yah
Ru-Ru-Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yah
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up
*scratches*

[Part IV: "Accelerator"]

[Verse 1]
Rap Ralph Bashki, smoking teriyaki
Verbal kamikaze, Axel at the roxy
In the men's room with a groupie sniffing oxys
Getting sloppy toppy, smelling like wasabi
You niggas mulianies, I swear they work with Johnny
Get locked, get out and walk around
And act like that shit funny, you niggas from the era of finessing, that is bummy
I'm from the era, flip that and you get that man his money
I think these niggas addict, they can't control their habits
Paying for these hoes but tricks for silly rabbits
I'm more Black Sabbath, not your average rapper rapping
Lamping up in Lanvin feeling like I'm a Buchannon
Ya hoes too demanding, my flows too outstanding
Lets me and you play a game of last man standing
Way above your standards, nothing that you can imagine
Body in the clouds and my mind's gone camping

[Chorus]
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy

[Verse 2]
You can hate, you can hate
You get stitches from this brick up in your face
Every morning, every night, and every day
I think of shit to make you feel some type of way
My homie caught a murder case and I seen 'em since
Just had a daughter, baby mama need rent
It don't make no sense so I don't add it up
So don't worry 'cause I got it, nigga keep ya head up
Rap niggas brag about it but ain't ever live it
I never try to glorify, I tell it how it is
You ain't ever copped a big, broke it down in all nicks
Or a nigga in ya crib saying where is that shit
Think these niggas tripping, think they gone camping
I see it clear as day, HD on a Samsung
Champion of critics, give a fuck about ya gimmicks
They mimicking the streets when I used to really live it

[Chorus]
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Walking light, the ground is so shaky
Losing sight 'cause things is so hazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy
Lost my mind, think I'm going crazy

[Part VI: "Die Like A Rockstar"]

[Verse 1]
Brown bless the mic like gesundheit
Bud 'bout the size of a bonsai
Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like sci-fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch in my target when I shoot my load
Bullseye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef, used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript, sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffin' Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Trippin' off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much, it's a miracle I'm livin'

[Chorus]
And I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I wanna party like Chris Farley
Shot of Hennessy, spike that with some molly
Tell mommy I'm sorry, God bless my soul
But life was so sublime, goin' out like Brad Nowell
I got that Kurt Cobain type of mindframe
Feelin' like Keith Moon, shrooms in my dressing room
Basquiat freestyle
Feeling like Jimi Hendrix in Anna-Nicole mouth
River Phoenix, '93, VIP
With some drugged-up porn hoes all around me
Like Teri Diver, Linda Wong
All in hell havin' orgies where the horns growing long
'Cause, bitch, I'm Frankie Lymon, Heath Ledger
Hyped up in a jacuzzi, doing that John Belushi
With Brittany Murphy, we blowin' hershey
I'ma die like a rockstar

[Chorus]
And I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar, die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
