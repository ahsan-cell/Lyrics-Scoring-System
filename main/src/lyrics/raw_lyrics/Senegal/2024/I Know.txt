All these thoughts that are raging in my head
Are so loud I keep waking up in bed
Sometimes I wish that I could shoot myself dead
So I wouldn’t have to deal with all these worries that I dread
Harming self just to cope with the stress
Give you my brightest expression even though I’m depressed
Can’t seem to weather the distress in my heart
Every thought of being useless and pathetic won’t depart
My mind is devastated by my circumstances
Crying to the heavens but nobody answers
Tryna search for an escape through my ecstasy
My worst behavior in this state’s got the best of me
See, the sky is grim, the light is dim
Will hope shine into the place that I’m in?
I look up to the ceiling with my eyes in the rain
Been hurting so long but still never used to the pain

[Hook]
There’s a flash in the air
I know adversity’s approaching but I’m still not prepared
They said there’s gonna be a storm tonight
Everybody take your heart and hold it tight
Alright? I know it’s tough to face
Fighting anxiety as we ready to brace
Just waiting for the moment when our woes will strike
Stay warm and bright it’s gonna be a cold night

Clouds of doubt form around out the window
I can feel my faith bending as the wind blows
Unprepared for the incoming lightning
I’m so scared of time and what it might bring
It’s too frightening, don’t wanna hear
Running from my fears but the problems stay in place
Crushed by the pressure as I wait
Always concerned about the future and the trials that await
Like can I survive on my own?
No wife, no kids, am I gonna die alone?
What if I don’t become the person that I aim to be?
Maybe this dream that I have wasn’t made for me
Will I ever find my purpose in this life?
Or will I conform to a living that won’t suffice?
Sometimes it’s hard to put my trust in God’s hands
Cause I’m too focused on completing every one of my plans

[Hook x2]
There’s a flash in the air
I know adversity’s approaching but I’m still not prepared
They said there’s gonna be a storm tonight
Everybody take your heart and hold it tight
Alright? I know it’s tough to face
Fighting anxiety as we ready to brace
Just waiting for the moment when our woes will strike
Stay warm and bright it’s gonna be a cold night
