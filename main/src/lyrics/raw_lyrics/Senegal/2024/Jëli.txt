[Intro]
Fuck

[Verse 1]
Does she walk? Does she talk? Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel always fuck me from my seat
Everybody's got their thing
Something different we all bring
Don't you let 'em clip your wings
You got it, you got it
We're on fire and we blaze in extraordinary ways
365 days

[Chorus]
A-B-C-D-E, F you
And your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke-ass car and that shit you call art
Fuck you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all fuck off

[SECTION II: Bedtro Station]

[Verse 2]
Narwhals, narwhals, swimming in the ocean
Causing a commotion
'Cause they are so awesome
Narwhals, narwhals, swimming in the ocеan
Pretty big and pretty white
Thеy beat a Polar Bear in a fight
Like an underwater unicorn
They've got a massive facial horn
They're the Jedi of the sea
They stop sea monsters eating ye!

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way (Nngh, Nngh)

[Chorus}
How can we dance when our earth is turnin'?
How do we sleep while our beds are burnin'?
Singing killed my grandma, okay
How can we dance when our earth is turnin'?
Oh no bro
How do we sleep while our beds are burnin'?

{SECTION III: Fetty Gloop]

[Spoken Bridge]
What? What was all that yelling?
They're selling chocolate
Chocolate?
Yeah!
What? What are they selling?
Chocolates
What?
Chocolates!
I can't hear you! What?
[Verse 3]
Baby girl, you're so damn fine, though
I'm tryna know if I could hit it from behind, though
I'm sipping on you like some fine wine, though
And when it's over, I press rewind though, ayy
You talking bands, girl, I got it
Benjamins all in my pocket
I traded in my Trues for some Robins
He playing Batman, Fetty's gon' rob him, ayy
I got a Glock in my 'Rari

[Chorus]
Fuck that n***a that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus, Amadeus, Amadeus
Amadeus, Amadeus
Oh, oh, oh, Amadeus

[SECTION IV: Made You Miss]

[Verse 4]
For a communist pariah, you come off as awfully cocky
But I'll make you bend the knee in round two like Nagasaki
I'm the box office topper, the Marvel showstopper
Got my name on this win like it's the Thanoscopter
You just got no answer for Fortnite's dopest dancer
I will Loki choke you out like my name was Throat Cancer
HUH
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight
[Chorus]
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head (Stewie I'm shitting)
Don't waste your time on me, you're already
The voice inside my head

[SECTION V: When Girls Collide]

[Refrain]
Is there anything better than pussy?
Yes, a really good pussy

[Verse 5]
When worlds collide
You'll laugh so hard you'll swear you've died
When worlds col—
Hold my hand, I'll be your guide
When worlds collide
Buckle-buckle-buckle up for the sweetest ride
And prepare to have your mind
When worlds collide
When-whe-whe-whe-whe-whe-when worlds collide

[Pre-Chorus]
Are you ready to go?
Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do, baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time
Are you ready to go?
Cause I'm ready to go
What you gonna do, baby, baby?
Are you goin' with me?
Cause I'm goin' with you
That's the end of all time

[Chorus]
Hump me, fuck me (Ahh)
Daddy, better make me choke (You better)
Hump me, fuck me (Ahh)
My tunnel loves to deep throat (It do)
Lick, lick, lick, lick (I lick it)
I want to eat yo' dick (I do)
But I can't fuck up my nails (I can't)
So I'ma pick it up with chopsticks

[Post-Chorus]
Mouth wide open, mouth wide open
Mouth wide open, mouth wide open
Mouth wide, mouth wide, mouth wide, mouth wide
Mouth wide, mouth wide, mouth wide, mouth wide

[SECTION VI: Rock Crawl Anthem]

[Verse 6]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem

[Pre-Chorus]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure

[Chorus]
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)
Give me that thing that I love (I'll turn the lights out)
Put your hands up, make 'em touch, touch (Make it real loud)

[SECTION VII: Cash With A Dollar Sign]

[Verse 7]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish, but don't spit it; swallow it and now finish, yeah
Me and Nate D-o-double-g
Lookin' for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we-we-we-we-we

[Chorus]
As the sun hits, she'll be waiting (Ooh, yeah, Da-dada-dada, dada-dada)
With her cool things and her heaven (Baby, baby)
Hey hey, lover, you still burn me (Ooh, yeah, Da-dada-dada, dada-dada)
You're a song, yeah (Ooh, yeah, Da-dada-dada, dada-dada)
It matters where you are

[Verse 8]
I can't stand it, I know you planned it
I'ma set it straight, this Watergate
I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
'Cause your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my god, it's a mirage
I'm telling y'all, it's I

[Buildup]
I hear the train a-comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
But that train keeps a-rollin', but that train keeps a-rollin'
But that train keeps a-rollin', but that train keeps a-rollin'
But that train keeps a-rollin', but that train keeps a-rollin'
But that trai-trai-trai-trai-trai-trai-trai-trai
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-train

[SECTION VIII: iHitTheDoor]

[Refrain]
Ooh-hoo-hoo
Ooh-hoo-hoo

[Verse 9]
Debbie just hit the door, she never had the door
One Prozac a door, husband's a do-do-door
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-door
Only been with one door, what happened to the door?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I will make you change your mind
These things happen all the time
And it's all real
I'm telling you just how I feel, so

[Chorus]
Wake up the members of my nation
It's your time to be
There's no chance unless you take one, and the time
To see the brighter side of every situation
Some things are meant to be
So give me your best and leave the rest to me

[SECTION IX: Walking On Me]

[Verse 10]
No more "please, stop"
No more hashtag boo'd up screenshots
No more tryin' to make me jealous on your birthday
You know just how I made you better on your birthday, oh
Do he do you like this? Do he woo you like this?
Do he lay it down for you, touch your poona like this?
Matter fact, never mind, we'll let the past be
May be his right now, but your ahh, ahh, ahh, ahh

[Pre-Chorus]
Dragged ya down below
Down to the devil's show
To be his guest forever
(Peace of mind is less than never!)
Hate to twist your mind
But God ain't on your side
An old acquaintance severed
(Burn the world your last endeavor!)

[Chorus]
We are always running for the thrill of it, thrill of it
Always pushing up the hill, searching for the thrill of it
On and on and on we are calling out, out again
Never looking down, I'm just in awe of what's in front of me

[SECTION X: ¡Mata La Ballena!]

[Verse 11]
Paper or plastic
Presents itself as a decision with an obvious answer
You pick paper 'cause the plastic will end up in the ocean
Giving a whale cancer
But did you know that
The paper in this bag is made from the prickly peckerwood tree
Which happens to be the residency of the dwarf-winged beaver beaver beaver bee

[Outro]
How can we dance when our earth is turnin'?
I got a Glock in my 'Rari
How do we sleep while our beds are burnin'?
Hump me, fuck me
Daddy, better make me choke
How can we dance when our earth is turnin'?
Where are you? And I'm so sorry
How do we sleep while our beds are burnin'?
It's not too late
It's never too late
