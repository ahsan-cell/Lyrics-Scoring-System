Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'
Waitin' for some lover to call
Dialed about a thousand numbers lately
Almost rang the phone off the wall

[Pre-Chorus]
Lookin' for some hot stuff baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Gotta have some hot stuff
Gotta have some love tonight

[Chorus]
Hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I need hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I want some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I need hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)

Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)

[Verse 2]
Lookin' for a lover who needs another
Don't want another night on my own
Wanna share my love with a warm blooded lover
Wanna bring a wild man back home

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta have some hot love baby this evenin'
I need some hot stuff baby tonight
I want some hot stuff baby this evenin'
Got to have some lovin'
Got to have love tonight

[Chorus]
Hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I need hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I want some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I need hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
Looking for some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I need some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
Looking for some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
I need some hot stuff
Baby, baby
Baby, baby (tonight)
