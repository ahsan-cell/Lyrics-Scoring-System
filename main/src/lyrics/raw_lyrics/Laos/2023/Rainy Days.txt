[Chorus]
Rainy days
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, what to say
Wish I knew how to find the way
Right back to you, on rainy days like
Rainy days
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, what to say
Wish I knew how to find the way
Right back to you, on rainy days like

[Verse 1]
Starin' at my phone, 난 깨있지
Hopin' for your call lately
I've been on my own maybe
이젠 지난 일에 맨날
Time with you was so amazing
Haven't changed, it's still the same me
늦었지만 우리 다시
Can we go back to that moment again? Yeah

[Chorus]
Rainy days
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, what to say
Wish I knew how to find the way
Right back to you, on rainy days like
Rainy days
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, what to say
Wish I knew how to find the way
Right back to you, on rainy days like

Remember how I used to make you laugh the most
내가 이런 말 할 자격 없어도
Let me make up for all the time we lost
We can start again, open all the doors
Don't tell me it's ovеr, we can start it over
너는 나의 네 잎 clover
Yеah, I can feel your touch, I remember your kiss
그 말은 아팠지 and I miss you

[Chorus]
Rainy days
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, what to say
Wish I knew how to find the way
Right back to you, on rainy days like
Rainy days
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, what to say
Wish I knew how to find the way
Right back to you, on rainy days like2
