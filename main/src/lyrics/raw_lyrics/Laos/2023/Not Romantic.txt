Dun dun
Boy talking shit
Ima hit em wit da-drumm
Don’t drop that dundudu inside my cup
Now I’m turnt up I’m booted up
From the west side so I know wussap
I’m booted up
Random and handsome pull up inna phantom
Pussy so wet if I don’t fuck she throw a tantrum
Not really romantic
But I’m in love wit getting bands man
Shordy wanna see if I can hit her inna handstand
Walk up in the party
I don’t really need a wristband
Pac touched down best believe ima split that
Swag so dumb got my kicks all missmatch
Bitch I ain’t finish Ian scratch the surface
If that boy not working treat him like he’s worthless
I been working hard so uk that I earned itYou might also like
