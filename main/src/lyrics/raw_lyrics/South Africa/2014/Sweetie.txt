When the rain drops hit the ceilings and the sky turns grey
Start Remenisque on feelings and memories of yesterday
Ill be the first to admit that I made a lot of mistake
But lookin back on it now ain't a lot of shit I would change


Verse 1 (Chronic)-
It's comin down heavy outside /
Raindrops on the Chevy bow tie /
It's so much smoke smoke in the whip We can barely see /
Windows up ch chiefin like a Cherokee /
On a hit streak like I play for the angels /
I got pressure in my joints Yao Mings ankles /
I feel so right so alive lord  thank you /
Everything is perfect right now wouldn't even change the /
Song on the radio , time or the place the /
Car that I'm riding in not even the way the /
Rain makes it hard to see don't wanna wake up /
From this dream no I don't wanna wake up /
The way I'm feelings could ride round all damn day /
Riding round town all damn day
Just me and the radio I don't care what way we go /
Tell that bitch don't call my phone today /
I just wanna be alone today /
Bitch I'm gone like a leaf in a lake /
Peace to my haters and the fucked up situation I was placed in And came out like fuckin a lion chasing /
His prey across the plain in broad day
Oh yeah ya mine now /
We like the tide in 09 
Signed now /
Flow so wicked it's too sweet /
Trunk hit heavy knock ya shoes off ya two feet /
Im freakaradicula takin off on Loose leaf /
The superlasickest muthafucker standin on two feet /
I need a dime breed bitch on my breath my tooth sweet /
Body get more oooos then a 3 from Stephen I usually /
Like to switch it up like full court pressure to 2-3 /
Lockdown d KG 03
Eyes on the title , rain in the streets /
Feel like the greatest to ever slump on a beat /

Verse 2 (Smokey)-
It's that simple shit that I don't understand
You gone push me away but then pull me in
You wanna hold me close till the very ends seems like  these bridges to broke to mend
But in my defense I got my wall up to provide the distance
I ain't really one for forgiveness
Cause  I ain't really one for the tripping I apologize if I'm drifting I ain't get to close cause it feel so different
Every time the rain drops then I start to miss you
Amnesia hits me  then my heart , mind and body all working against me w
Trynna find another remedy other than Hennessy
Late night rides have became a friend to meet
Can't sleep get high nose bleeds mind on repeat steady
Thinking bout it all and watching it play out
As I go row down  144 i can see now rain hit the window
And the dark cloud looking like a broken Levy bout to blow now some how i can relate
I must say for Pete sake a brake in the weather would make my day
Cause I been stuck in this emotional state
My homies say I'm craze and it's just a phase
It takes times to recooperate from all the rain I'm like shit how long how sing many days
Im neck deep with a ball and chain I gots to get away and focus on my situation  kinda hard when you have no concentration
Cause your mind keep contemplating on conversations that you had before Y'all separated
BUT Things change with quick no hesitation
AND Rain drops fall precipitation
Chorus

Verse 3 (DG)-
Man I'm tired of the bullshit I'm tired of the stress/
I may not be perfect but I'm doing my best/
I hope this shits worth it cause I need some rest/
And if it's not I don't know what we gone do/
But how could we fail after all we been through/
On this winding path I think I need a break/
I'd hitchhike but I need to find my own way/
21 years old still at my mamas crib damn I really need to find my own place/
It's like the rains been falling down here for so long/
As time flies by its getting harder to hold on/
Last night I dreamt that I lost my grip and slipped right off a cliff/
Right before I hit eyes sprang wide awake spent all day trynna decipher it/
Need to come to grips with the fact that I might be depressed And I can't get away from it/
On days like this I sit and I reminisce memories playing in my head/
Like I should of done this or I should have done that/
I mind is a mess my head running laps/
Need it off my chest so I made it a rap/
But imma be straight I already know/
Cause without the rain then the flowers can't grow/
And without a shower there ain't a rainbow/
And without a rainbow there's no pot of gold/
So imma keep moving and ride out the storm/
Remember that the next time that you feeling low/
Just grab your rain coat and ride out the storm/
