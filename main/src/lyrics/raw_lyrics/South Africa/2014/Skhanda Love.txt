Gangster love

[Chorus: Nandi Mngoma & K.O]
We've got that gangster love
Nothing can come between us (between us)
Noma besishwashwata
Ungawari uphethe mina
Let me hold you down
Baby let me hold you down uyisosha lami
Let me show you how mak'shuba ngizofa nawe
We soka lami

[Verse 1: K.O]
Ngiyazifela nges'ponono sam' aningiyekele
Sweety ngik'nika konke okungokwam' iya di julle day
Ubatshele ngendlela les'gebengu
Siyilwele lento esinayo
Hayibo bhari bebethemben'
Ngihlala ngisendleleni and ngiyazi ukuthi uhlal' uzibuza
Mahlambe nginama substitute
Trust issues nama excuse
My love for you is untouchable
Ngiyafunga nasi stru
Wemntano muntu kudala wehla unyuka nam'
Uloku kgereza uphanda upressa uphusha nam'
I'm blessed 'cause you the one I guess
Iphupho lam' selifezekile asenz' is'vumelwano
For better or worse
Akukho okuzos' hlukanisa
Khohlwa all this ludicrous rumors abantu ba busy
Bekhuluma sisi
Never let these bunch of lunatics ruin this
Truly it's you I wanna spend my future with

[Verse 2: K.O]
Yeah-uh, treat you like every day is valentine's
Fellas I'm...
Totally whippped ngini tshela 9-9
And I said that I, would never settle down never mind
I guess the heart is ahead of time
Used to keep a pair of dimes
Now I'm up here, a dime came into my life
And really shifted the paradigm
Phuma langa sikothe
She hella fine
Nag'thengi skelem' da
Angdhingi neskhwele blind
She turns me on when she acts like that
But she gets a little excited
Ang'buze iy'nto zak'dala
Wanna know about my Ex, why's that?
Kancane kancane X-Y-Z
Noooor-maan
Just know that I will never hurt you
And by virtue of that
You deserve shoes and perfumes
I'm giving you my word boo
No side dish
You my main course I will never desert you

Baby let me hold you down uyisosha lami
Let me show you how mak'shuba ngizofa nawe

Ebusuku nome mini sweety noma nini
Uthando lwam'

[Chorus: Nandi Mngoma & K.O]
We've got that gangster love
Nothing can come between us (between us)
Noma besishwashwata
Ungawari uphethe mina
Let me hold you down
Baby let me hold you down ulisosha lami
Let me show you how mak'shuba ngizofa nawe
We soka lam'
