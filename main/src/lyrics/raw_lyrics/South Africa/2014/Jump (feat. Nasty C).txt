[Verse 1: Cassper Nyovest]
And I keep it hundred and fifty, write my number on the autograph
Swear this shit is kinda trippy, kill the pussy she a hologram
Pardon me, pardon me, pardon me, would you accept my apology?
I’m sorry for killing the game and making everybody look like they wanna be’s
It’s whatever, it's dazzle we never run outta cash, yeah
Having fun like a motherfucker, fuck around and hit the dab
Turn around and hit the dab
Getting rich you getting mad
Hit the car and do the milly rock, stay away hit the dab
'Ngazoba 'ngazoba serious, thina s'yaz'dlalela please please
200k on the necklace, I got the keys to the city
Nobody doing better, looks like I’m the king now
I mean both albums went platinum, this shit looks like I got twins now
They say I rap about money too much, my subject matter is gonna need an adjustment
But ever since I got richer than your favorite rapper, I ain’t give a fuck since
Fucking new bitches in my old house, old women in my new crib
You all following my footsteps, well put it on if the shoe fits

[Verse 2: Nasty C]
All my people in the vill, picking teams from the other side
Be very careful with the shit, I seen em spazz now I’m traumatized
Little change ain’t never changed, I drink a little champ for the pain
Man if it's fuck 'em all, then it's fuck 'em all I don’t think I can ever rephrase it
I’m getting calls from my cousin's cousins, never seen that nigga my whole life
I had a talk with the Skhanda honey, was thinking about fucking the whole time
Like get in the back, leave every recording device on the dashboard
After one look at my invoice got a drivers license and a passport
That means I’m about to go overboard, over board and over board this bitch
Whatchu think they taking photos for, cause I am very important bitch
Please close all the curtains for me, they might be recording this
I’m not going out again, til I get my rollie bitch

[Verse 3:Anatii]
This beat is a hundred and fifty, niggas better sell a kidney
Never show them where the crib be, shit is looking like it’s Disney
Baby girl get your tickets, your friend saying its been a minute
You know that the clock is ticking, you know I turn up for a living
I, you know that I do, I really I do
We popped a few things in the back now we all in the mood (all in the mood)
I just fucked up my shoes, get on the booze
These niggas is liars we fucked his ass, this shit reviewed
Tell em the truth
My grill is ice cold (shit's so cold)
I hit it with the lights on
And she only dance to my song, and she sucking like it’s lipo
Jump a jump a nigga bungee, me my niggas run the country
Sexy chubby where the fun be?
Sexy chubby where the fun be?
All you niggas is some junkies, and Penny Sparrow is a monkey
All these girls they want the shandis, It’s jungle fever like Jumanji
