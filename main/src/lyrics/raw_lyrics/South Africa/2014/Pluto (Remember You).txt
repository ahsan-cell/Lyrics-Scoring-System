I don't know what to do
A distant planet
Is pulling me away from you
Whatever
Forget her
Pretend that
You never even met her
I'll sever the tether
That's keeping you together
Forget her
It's better
But I still remember
Remember, remember
I still remember
I stand on the moon
I don't know what to do
A distant planet
I wish that it would pull you too
Whatever
Forget her
Pretend that
You never even met her
I'll sever the tether
That's keeping you together
Forget her
It's better
But I still remember
Remember, remember
I still remember you, you
I still remember you
I still remember
I stand in your room
I don't know what to do
A distant planet
Is pulling me away from you
I'll never
Forget her
Whatever
May happen to me ever
In pain and in pleasure
My heart will still be tethered
Forever
Together
And I still remember
Remember, remember
I still remember
I'm still on the moon
I still don't know what to do
But I can still feel you
I know that you can feel me too
I'll never
Forget her
Whatever
May happen to me ever
In pain and in pleasure
My heart will still be tethered
Forever
Together
And I still remember
Remember, remember
I still remember you, you
I still remember you
I still rememberYou might also like
