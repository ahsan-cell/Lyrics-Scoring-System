Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah

[Chorus: AB Crazy]
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t
So sorry, I’m sorry we done came up
Sorry, nah you niggas ain’t real enough
Sorry you hate the lames that I came with
Sorry you hate the broads that I roll with
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t

[Verse 1: AB Crazy]
Too many haters where I came from
I got too many haters claimin' they my day ones
Real snakes don’t hiss no more they speak louder
They at home getting bored and just gossip about us
I dropped my first album
Niggas went out and bought it
Them other niggas they hated I didn’t share the profit
Now they’re dropping emails with the little details
Since I don’t mess with you dudes why would I fuck with your tunes?
When I started you thought it was easy, you’re wrong nigga
Blue ticks is all you get from me, I’m gone bitches
You could probably get a picture, or send ya little sister
This relationship is messed up like it’s long distance
Keep my name out your mouth, boy you don’t listen
We let the guns go 'Bang" and the boy missin'
Sipping on drank sipping on drank
I see you at every party I don’t see you in the banks, no
You might also like[Chorus: AB Crazy]
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t
So sorry, I’m sorry we done came up
Sorry, nah you niggas ain’t real enough
Sorry you hate the lames that I came with
Sorry you hate the broads that I roll with
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t

[Verse 2: Muzee]
I don’t wanna live a lie, I don’t wanna suicide
I just wanna stay true, till the day of my demise
I don’t want to live on hype
I don’t wanna win in spite
All my enemies instead I’m praying that they stay alive, alive
Mama raised no fool, I got my intellect in tact
I’m a G.O.A.T and that’s a fact
I’m an inferno too
We savages and outlaws we don’t play by no rules
Man I know that we won't die poor, we payed our dues
I feel like I need vacation
Man I gon' go away
Tired of being patient
Wanna sip on Bombay all day
Maybe cocktail
If I put you under pressure then I’m sorry
Don’t give a fuck about the haters, we gon' celebrate
You cannot stop us we got faith and everyday we pray
You got a problem then you gotta say it to my face
Man, these haters and naysayers don’t understand
[Chorus: AB Crazy]
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t
So sorry, I’m sorry we done came up
Sorry, nah you niggas ain’t real enough
Sorry you hate the lames that I came with
Sorry you hate the broads that I roll with
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t

[Verse 3: AB Crazy]
There’s a war outside no man is safe from it
Cause these people will do anything for that income
And I still won’t pay attention to the insults
I’m so blessed and all your curses can’t do nothing
Where were you when we were planning it all?
They can’t touch me
All they do is call lawyers to piss me off
You wanna battle but you lost the war
I’m trying to find a better angle I’m aiming at you boy
Let’s get it popping one on one, yeah me and you
Up in the studio, AB performing miracles yeah
Gossip is for the broads, you a silly dude
I stay blind to the hate like Stevie do
My mama told me be careful
My brother dancing with devils
You know I want this forever
This beef we’re gonna settle
I don’t know what they want from a nigga
Everyday I wanna pray, give a fuck what you think (What you think)
[Chorus: AB Crazy]
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t
So sorry, I’m sorry we done came up
Sorry, nah you niggas ain’t real enough
Sorry you hate the lames that I came with
Sorry you hate the broads that I roll with
I’m sorry them boys made it and you niggas didn't
I’m sorry we in the building and you niggas ain’t
