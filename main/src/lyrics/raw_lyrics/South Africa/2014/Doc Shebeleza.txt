[Verse 1]
I’m still runnin’ (Aish)
Still runnin' (True)
I say fuck my exes but Boity can still get it
She’s the best, the best, the best, the best, the best
Cassper Nyovest, Nyovest, Nyovest, Nyovest, Nyovest
I’m tryna give Boitumelo a baby and no one man, no one can stop me
It’s actually funny the things that we do to qcaza basadi-basadi (Sadi)
Boss ever ka go juta, ne ke tlhola ke ba tlela ka di two thou
Now I'm about to get a new car and a new house and a new bitch
Maybe ke tla itholela m’sugar mama
Still wonder if the shit’s real
I get on the stage and women scream like Meek Mill (Basadi)
Fucking in something i was born with…
I took off my pants and she said short gun, long dick
Man, this what they be waiting for
I bet all your Gims are asking nigga what you hating for
Start talking everyday mare swak swak mabebeza
Wake up everyday feeling like...

[Verse 2]
If you feel like hake o nxanywe, gana ka wena
Jozi ele busy ntsi-ntsi-ntsi spana ka wena
Remember when we started kgale bare bana ba tsenwa
Now I’m having silly WhatsApp conversations with girls like Babalwa Mneno (Ain’t gonna come up)
Sa tlo shenama man, I ain't gonna come up I went for the Carter
To go etsa ma ada lebo Ba2cada, walala wa sala
Lenna ke galla go winner di-SAMA
And then it's the Grammys - I swear Imma do it
I swear to my mama
You think my swagger ain't new bitch?
That I’m gonna quit?
I’m on my Teko Modise, on some bitch
Give me back my shit (Tlisa kwano)
Give me back my shit (Tlisa kwano)
Oh yeah I wanted peace
She said she don’t worship me
But every night she on her knees
Minnie! Ndifun’ukshada uMinnie (Dlamini) Dlamini
But first I gotta make a Milli You
Just talking everday maar swak swak mabebeza
Wake up everyday feeling like...
[Chorus]
Doc Doc Shebeleza
