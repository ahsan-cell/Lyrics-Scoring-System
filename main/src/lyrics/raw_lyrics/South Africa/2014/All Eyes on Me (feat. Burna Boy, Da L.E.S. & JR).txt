[Verse 1: AKA]
I'm tryna get this rap money in a rush
Tell 'em back it up for me when you see me in the club
Competition dead and buried in the dust
I'm like the legendary Brenda Fassie, Zola Budd
Once you get it, you never get enough
And you gon' need better credit to get ahead of us
We the power circle, comin' to you live from the third world
Gettin' high off the purple (Ay)
Bitch, I'm on the top of my game
Black car, rap star, look at my face
If you ain't fuckin' what you here for?
I got a 7:30 shuttle to the airport, therefore
Twerk contest, I'm a nuisance
Jah bless, do it for the youth dem
I'm at the table with the bosses
You need to table up your losses

It's a robbery (All eyes on me)

[Verse 2: JR]
Slowdown, what's the hurry boy?
Chilling at The Grand attackin', tswaking these mommy's boys
Pumping L.E.S for chubby mommies who got it going on (On)

[Verse 3: Da L.E.S, JR]
You know it always come back down to the H
At this stage of the game
I let the champagne out the cage
I got a Jesus on my chain
A bunch of Greygoose in my veins
A couple of bad bitches from the States (From the States)
Skateboards in my bedroom wall
I had to take it back to the North 94
Dollies on my penthouse floor
Now it's all white parties on a stretched out lawn, North (North)
These streets is cold
You on the outside smoking sticks and stones
I'm all about mine like Patrice's gold
And I ain't gon' stop till I reach my goal (Y'all ain't fucking with me)
Leaked nudes on the iPad (Gcwala)
Previews on the Snapchat (Ziyawa)
'Cause I'm popping off (Shower)
Like 'em Naija boys
[Outro: Da L.E.S]
Alright, roundabout now I wanna bring everybody's club status right back down to the ground level
Big shout out to Pink Cadillacs
Russell the Love Muscle, Boogey Harry, R.I.P Aldo Mr Who's-who, Grant Chikwane, Shibabadu Shibabu
And of course we can't forget Kick-ass Kenny Mastry
Cause now we in the mainstream
Now fuck with the A-Team
