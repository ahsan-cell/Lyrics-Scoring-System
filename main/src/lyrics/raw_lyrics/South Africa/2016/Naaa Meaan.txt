Bragga!

[Chorus: Cassper Nyovest]
Making money never been a issue
Magazine covers we the issue
I’m shitting on em need a tissue
It's painful nigga ishu!
Naaa meeaan?
Be on magazines
Nigga flip a beam
Naaa meeaan?

[Post-Chorus: Nadia Nakai]
Pull up in a 4 door Audi
Dropped a milli on my bus and my Audi
All this champagne got me feeling rowdy
Windows down cause this shit is kinda cloudy
Naaa meeaan? cloudy
Naaa meeaan? bitch you know I’m rowdy
Naaa meeaan? cloudy
Naaa meeaan? bitches got me rowdy

[Verse 1: Nadia Nakai]
Baddest bitch was never average
21 a fucking savage
Cinderella to these hoes
Tell ’em to bring out my carriage
Baddest bitch to cop my batchelors
Leveled up and got my masters
Hit the airport with no baggage
And Yes bitch I signed to Cassper
He’s the master
Running up on him like Caster
Get your cash up
All you bitches look like last year
Need to catch up
You fucked up and I’m Stuart Baxter
Actually Rashofrd
Free kicks for you fuckin bastards

Nigga flip a beam
Naaa meeaan?

[Verse 2: Nadia Nakai]
Bloody murder on my ankles
Steady murmur all you haters
Never heard of, I'm your maker
Money earned and yes I’m paid fool
My shit painful
All you bitches should be grateful
My shots fatal like that shit you blow up your nasal
My shit hateful
All you niggas on my payroll
It’s okay though
They don’t move until I say so
You want fame hoe
Find me on the 18th floor
On your man’s face
That's what I call a facial
Told you niggas I’m a fucking boss, yeah
Told these niggas I got different sauce yeah
Fuck these bitches I’m a different cloth yeah
And I’m quick to cut these fake niggas off yeah
Bragga!
