(Ambitiouz)

[Chorus: Ndu Browns]
Ungabe usa-stress-a my dali, isoka lakho lisendleleni
In a two-seater, ngiku highway cruising lane to lane
Umudinga i-dayimane elimnyama, there is a price to pay
You got a price to pay (You got a price)
You got a price to pay
Ungabe usa-stress-a my dali, isoka lakho lisendleleni
In a two-seater, ngiku highway cruising lane to lane
Umudinga i-dayimane elimnyama, there is a price to pay
You got a price to pay (You got a price)
You got a price to pay

[Verse 1: Ndu Browns]
Record labels ang’donsa ku-landline
Loyalty mina angithengwa ngemali
You can google me umungangazi
Ng’yotheleka ng’yoshiya engingalazi
I am an a-lister ngisho eMalawi
Sebeng’qashela ama-body guard
Phela mina nguMzulu onemali
Told my Mama, asiy’khiphe s’yeDubai
Elamanyani... Seng’ne P.A, ang’satholakali
Bathi wa-baller kangaka
Ngathi lomfana uphunyelwe izimali
Bathi udali ng’bukeka kamnandi, ukuthi ng’yacula nje sekuyi-bonus
Ngathi lo-muthi siwu phuzekhemesi maw’thatha uk’bheka as’culi ngisho uMaskandi

[Verse 3: Danya]
Zonke izintombi seziyang’shela sekuyangibhora
Intombi zibhala i-love letter angisayfundi ng’yayifonqa
Umqala ugcwele ama-ice yeah, ng’cela uku defrost-a
Ng’phethe netshitshi eceleni bheka amabele ayang’khomba
Oh, Sweety Mama
Ng’hamba nge slwane
Vele ngi-ghost bang’biza ngoMdeva
Intombi yami imnyama
Imoto yami imnyama
Yonke into imnyama
Ne card lase bank
Thathi iPhone yami ubheke icall log
Ufica imissed call ye office laseVans
Ngena e-Angola bangizwa ngendaba
K’gcwele ama-bouncer abakhoni nokung’veza
