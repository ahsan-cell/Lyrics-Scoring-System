Badman, roll up the ganja
Rockstar, no de Rasta
Let me continue the saga
Young nigga on the come up
My nigga I'm on the road now
New rims on a Honda, up in the trap and they know
They know I'm coming like karma
Zaga, zaga, zaga, zaga
Came here for the gwalas, no time for no drama
Shabba, shabba, shabba, shabba
Dreadlocks, no barber
Badman, real life shatta
Fuck around and get popped up
She wanna roll with the bad guy
I'm the original Dondon
Swipe-a, swipe-a, no cash
Hennessy, no dash
Blowing money fast, I get paid in advance

Ragga, ragga, ragga, ragga
I just got a key from the plugga
My niggas is Real Madrid, you niggas is more like Malaga
We spilling champagne like its lager
The honey you wanted, I got her
I hit it and don't even call her
She only wanted e-Wallet
Her name is whatchamacallit
She call you whatchamawho
You talking that "I wanna wife you"
She call that hullabaloo
These bitches is fucking for 10G's
She lucky she got it, I'm stingy
But she remind me of Thembi
I told her to drop on my sandys

Poppin' bottle, no matter

Ragga, ragga, ragga, ragga
Family Tree up in this motherfucker
Lotlhe mo le di ntwananyana tsa ka
Rona re magwara-gwara-gwara-gwara
Fresh off the plane from the United States
And I'm smelling like "Dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar"
Never hesitate to pay me my money my nigga
Faka, faka, faka, faka
I know y'all be hating on me undercover
But nobody's ever had a better come up
I'm in the street, hustling until the sun up
Ngudu already got the summer covered
So y'all niggas ain't gotta put out no music
My old shit inspired your new shit
My closet is full of exclusives
You'll never catch me in Carducci
Maybe Gucci, rocking H Lorenzo in the Benz-o
Get the picture nigga, that's the lens-o
Say you balling but you got a landlord
I don't understand, I don't get it
I'm about my business
Every single single is sounding different when they listen
I'm the realest
Shit is always livid when I'm in the building
Where are my fucking niggas?
It's Ragga
