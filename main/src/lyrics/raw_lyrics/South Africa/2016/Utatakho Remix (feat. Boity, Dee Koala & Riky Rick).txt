You got my stuff
Thank you
How much it is
I don't think this would fit you
Well I didn’t ask it would fit, I asked how much it was
How much is this Marie?
It's very expensive (Very expensive)
Look i got money to spend in here
I don't think we have anything for you

[Verse 1: Rick Rick]
(Let’s do it like this)
I fell in love with the mpahlas, I fell in love with the mpahlas
I could pull up in pajamas, I could pull up in pajamas
I gotta fill the garage
911 look like Gwede Mantash'
Baby mama look like Nicki Minaj
Little Mikey look like me, oh my gosh!
Money looking like it's heavenly sent
I prayed for every cent
I think I gotta repent
I murder every event, ooh yah!
I'm tryna prevent, death but it's looking so damn imminent
There's no argument, I am a hundred percent
The reason why Hip Hop is drenched, eish
Drip drip (Drip drip)
Drip drip (Drip drip), nank' utatakho! (Nank' utatakho!)
Sphand’ ama-coins, sphand’ ama-coins, yimin' u-Arab
Letha lomshini oka Rambo
Rest in peace abo Karabo

[Verse 2: Dee Koala]
Capha capha capha, imanz' ingxaza yam
Mna ndisuk’ ekapa, ak'kho mtu ofana nam
Yanga suwara ndzak'phathela ulwandle
Akho ne need yothumela uVelaphi
Pha kum eKhaltsha luninzi ulwandle, kutheni ulibele uba mna ndivelaphi?
Ndithi ndi-wack, behind my back
Xhak' dlal' i-track, uthi "Khawu send-e"
My kicks are stupid, khawuze ne mat
Uz'shaya nge case, nd'zovus' i-Black, yah
Seliwash, drip drip, nangu umamakho woah!
New bag, big big, nangu umamakho woah!

[Verse 3: Boity]
(Di kae di veil popo tsele?)
(Yah, ke le batla one by one)
(Ke le batla one by.. okay I'm joking, let's be serious. Alright)
Personally this a touchy subject
'Cause my dad was alive but his presence wasn't
So my mama was everything that he wasn't
But then still in the end, I'ma always love him
I can never be the one to ever judge him
Cause I turned out amazin', so I ain't buggin'
I mean look at my life, all the haters love it
Got a big body whip, so I'm way above it
Way above it!
Hope you listenin', I'm saying somethin'
Bomabarebare ba ne ba reng?
Ba re ke dintja, ke bona katse
Katse e tletse tsela feela, nna ha ke tlale
Stalkings is Gucci, ain't never running
Phone cover Louis, don't ever buzz it
Name on that Forbes list, go check the numbers
You busy bitchin'!
