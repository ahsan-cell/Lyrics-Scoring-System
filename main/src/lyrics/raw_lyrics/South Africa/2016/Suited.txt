Oh yeah yeah
Oh, ooh na-
Ooh na-, yeah
Ooh na-na
Ooh na-na

Suited for each other yeah
Don't try to move me from my lover yeah
Suited for each other, suited for each other
Tailor-made I'm glued up on my lover, I
I'll never lose him to another yeah

[Verse 1]
When we talked on the phone and you said that you love me
Did you say that, this for show yeah?
I wanna scream from the top of the rooftop
Till you hear my love for you
I keep on rewind
I struggle to find
New words to define

[Pre-Chorus]
What a love, what a love yeah
What a love, what a love yeah
What a love
What a love, what a love yeah
What a love, what a love yeah
What a love
What a love, what a love
What a love, what a love
Baby, we both know
It's just something we both know yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Suited for each other, suited for each other (Ooh na-na)
Don't try to move me from my lover, yeah (Ooh na-na)
Suited for each other, suited for each other (Ooh na-na)
Tailor-made I'm glued up on my lover
I, I'll never lose him to another yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Never
Never, no, yeah
Never
Never lose him to another yeah
Never
Never, no, yeah
Never, no, yeah

[Verse 2]
See, I just really miss you yeah
And I'm forever in tune to you
Somehow I just stay glued to you
I wanna, gotta get away
No, not forever, just a little break
But I can't find the time or place
I don't ever wanna go too far away
So we play husband and wife
You take the keys to my life
I know we're just a little too young yeah
And having just a little too much fun, ayy but
What a love that we've got
What a love that we've got
When it just don't stop, we
Fade into a special space, I
Pray we never lose the faith yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
What a love, what a love yeah (What a love baby)

Baby, we both know (What a love)
It's just something we both know yeah (What a love)

[Bridge]
It's just something we both know
It's just something we both know yeah (Ooh na-na)
We both know yeah (Ooh na-na)

[Chorus]
Suited for each other, suited for each other (Ooh na-na)
Don't try to move me from my lover, yeah (Ooh na-na)
