Sketchy Bongo

[Chorus: Shekinah]
Let's take it back to the beach
Where we were young and carefree
This is how it should be
Said the city don't feel me
Let's take it back to the beach
When it was just you and me
Baby, you're all that I need
Said the city don't feel...

[Verse 1: Shekinah]
Good no more
There's too much 'push and go'
Always in the fast-lane, uh
Said the city don't feel
Good no more
I need it nice and slow
Rollin' with my bae
Rollin' it that way
Said the city don't feel me

[Chorus: Shekinah]
Let's take it back to the beach
Where we were young and carefree
This is how it should be
Said the city don't feel me
Let's take it back to the beach
When it was just you and me
Baby, you're all that I need
Said the city don't feel...

Good no more
We're all just chasing dough
It's always them papers
Chasing them papers, I
Said the city don't feel
Good no more
I'm longing for the shores
'Cause I left my heart there
She stole my heart there

Said the city don't feel me

[Chorus: Shekinah & Kyle Deutsch]
Let's take it back to the beach
Where we were young and carefree
This is how it should be
Said the city don't feel me
Let's take it back to the beach (Take it back to the beach)
When it was just you and me (When it's just you and me)
Baby, you're all that I need (You all that I need)
Said the city don't feel...

[Outro: Shekinah & Kyle Deutsch]
Good no more
There's too much 'push and go'
Always in the Fastlane
Always the Fastlane, uh
Said the city don't feel
Good no more
I need it nice and slow
Rollin' with my bae
Rollin' it that way
Said the city don't feel me2
