[Verse 1]
The truth is I'm high your love is feelings
And I don't know what to do
Do I hold my breath as I wait for you?
Can I afford to compromise
These feelings and save my mind?
I feel my head rush as I think of you
And try to put myself to use
Left there in time don't always heal the wounds
It's crazy it must be love

[Pre-Chorus]
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?

You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart

[Verse 2]
Travelling light
I don't know how to do it
Travelling small
I can't see myself through it
Going to places with you
I know will be alright
I come to you
Going at a hundred and twenty
See cops, Please stop
They say, "Hey is there a place you wanna go?"
And we will collide
And we will collide

[Refrain]
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
Oh, uh, oh
[Pre-Chorus]
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?
Should I hold on the past?
Will you let me crash?

[Chorus]
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart
You are a citizen
A resident, a resident in my heart

[Refrain]
Oh, uh, oh

You are the one my one
