[Verse 1: Gemini Major]
I got the trees, the trees, the trees
Bad man roll up the ganja
Flew all way back from London
Fuck around with the Don Don
Somebody should have told you when to show up when it's popping off like a hand gun
Don't sign yeah we industry
Wrestlemania when I'm in the car

Darling be calling my name
Parties all over the place
Got money all up in the bank
And money busting out the safe
I'm getting cheques in an envelope
To doing shows all over the globe
This feeling like a dime a dozen
No we never stop for nothing

[Verse 3: Gemini Major]
I'm in the lobby with the groupies
Already cheating on my new B
Making hits on the dirty
My credits looking like a end of a movie

Women all over the pad
'Cause they in love with the cash
Missing your calls is my bad
Just take a look at that ass
She falling in love with my bands

If you want it shawty tell me in advance
Cause I only wanna smash it no romance
No romance, no romance

She know I'm a savage, relentless
Cause I go hard with the business

And keep your shit going from a distant
You love to say my name, don't mention it
'Cause Imma have you back like a pension
