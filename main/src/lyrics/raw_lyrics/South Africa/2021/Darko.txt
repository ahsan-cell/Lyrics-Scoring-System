Oh God
So tell them man ah royalty, like the prince wey come from Saudi
So if ah me you're looking for, you haffi come across the road

Playing with grenade and bomb
Access to steel and copper, real and proper
Don't make the ting start buss off, back off and seize

Tell them me never like the way all ah them ah operate

These days man ah separating the real from the fake
Tell them ah create more plan ah, to try get one up on the Don Gorgon
