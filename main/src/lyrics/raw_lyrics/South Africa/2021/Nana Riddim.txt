Riding down the street
And I see a pretty girl
She wants me, I want her
I will take her to my world
I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car
You know I'm in my car
I'm stunting in my car
My car

[Verse 1: Young Stunna]
Ridin' higher than a light pole, lookin' like a light show
Paint from the east but my pants from Tokyo
Trunk on Summer Jam, yeah I'm the Stunna, man
So much money I can't fit it in a rubber band
And they know I go hard
Ridin down Craxton stuntin' in my car
Tips on the 'Scape cause they knowin' I'm a star
And I brought my own drink, I ain't fuckin' with the bar
See me all through Richmond, slidin' on the sixes
Paint like French's, poppin' at the bitches
Scrape thang scrape thang, Uno got one too
Fuck with your boy, girl I bet it'd be a fun move

Say you wanna be B but you not the ocean
