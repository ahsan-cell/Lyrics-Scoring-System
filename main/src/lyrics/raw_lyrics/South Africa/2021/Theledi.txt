The sun began to rise within me
Her warmth had melted all the ice
The nights grew shorter, the shadows fled
And in their place, a new life was spread

[Verse 1]
Uh
We danced in the moonlit snow
Our laughter echoed, the cold didn't show
We whispered sweet nothings into the air
And watched our breaths mingle, without a care
The seasons changed, the cold turned to spring
And with it, my heart began to sing
The buds grеw on the trees, so did our love
Her support had hеlped me rise above
The warmth of her embrace was like the sun
It chased the shadows, one by one
Each day was a battle, but not a fight lost
With her love, I knew I could pay the cost
The mirror no longer showed a stranger
But a person, whole, with love to offer
The darkness had lifted, my soul was free
Thanks to her, I could finally be me

[Chorus]
The sun began to rise within me
Her warmth had melted all the ice
The nights grew shorter, the shadows fled
And in their place, a new life was spread

We took each step with hope in our eyes
The future looked less like a lie
We knew there'd be more nights of pain
But with her love, we'd find the rain
And in the warmth of her gentle touch
I discovered I had enough
To keep moving forward, to keep trying
Her love had set my soul on fire, never dying
The cold nights, they're still there
But now, I know that she's always there
To share her warmth, her light, her cheer
And for that, I'm eternally near
Together, we're more than just two
We're a beacon in the cold night's view
Guiding each other through the dark
Our love, a story to be told, never to be stark
So now, when the cold winds blow
I think of her love, how it does grow
And though the nights may still be long
Her warmth keeps my heart from going wrong

[Chorus]
The sun began to rise within me
Her warmth had melted all the ice
The nights grew shorter, the shadows fled
And in their place, a new life was spread
[Outro]
A warmth that time nor space can't replace
Her love is what will forever keep the cold at bay
