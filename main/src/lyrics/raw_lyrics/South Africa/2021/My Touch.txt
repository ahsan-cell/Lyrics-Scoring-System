Chop daily is a recording
Come on, my brother
Come on

[Chorus: Eugy]
I get a model, girl tall
Put that body on call
I took the honey on tour
I put the money on top
I put the money on
Now she falling in love
Said she feeling my G
She feeling my style
She loving my touch (Touch)

[Verse: Eugy]
Take it lower
Your waist is taking over
Baby go down, rotate
Baby showdown (Let's give dem)
See class, see ass
I love it when you move it like that (Come on)

Anything that you dey wan' chop
