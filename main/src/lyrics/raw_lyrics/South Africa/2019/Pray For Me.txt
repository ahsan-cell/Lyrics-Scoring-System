I just wanna be a hero to all of the people that told me that I would be somethin'
I just wanna see my son living life but to never forget that daddy is hustling
I know we gonna make it
I just wanna be your favourite
These are the things that I wanna do
I could go all day
Lord please keep mama safe
I'm tryna move her to another place
See a smile on her face
My son finna rock Polo forever
Just to show him daddy kept it together
Him struggle like me? No never
He was born and I climbed up the ladder
Now they know my name, they love my chase
For my people, me I'll never change

[Chorus]
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh yeah
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh yeah
If you knew what I'm going through
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh my God
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh Lord
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh Lord
If you knew what I'm going through
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh Lord

He said, she said, who gives a damn?
All this talk got me going HAM
Me, I stuck to the plan
I sing, I write and I needed a bang
I know that mama is prayin'
Them haters forgot all the shit they were sayin'
I'm 'bout to go Super Saiyan
They still think I'm playin'
Came from the bottom got high like jamaican
Me I'm an artist,  focus on your day shift
Don't say shit especially if your swagger is just basic
Homie just face it, I got the juice nizogcwala
La ang'fikanga mahala
I got the juice nizogcwala
Swag game gotta be on a hunna
I had a dream I bussin' Rihanna

[Chorus]
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh yeah
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh yeah
If you knew what I'm going through
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh my God
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh Lord
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh Lord
If you knew what I'm going through
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me, oh Lord
[Outro]
Oh Lord
Oh Lord
