Ne ke ithotse ke reditse mahipi, be ke dibala go re entlek
A re shapise mahipi a ndiya daar ko kasi
Gusha!

[Chorus: Cassper Nyovest]

[Verse 1: Cassper Nyovest]
Let’s dumb it down so they understand
Cassper Semenya, yeah, I’m the man
My money grows ‘cause reya phanda man
Y’all stuck in the same figure, jenge under pan
Ra khanda, damn I been down, damn I been down
Cassper Nyovest or I standing it out
You see the broads that I’m handling now
You will come short, divandal is out
Ganela ko tlase, soap ya maphatshe
I’m prolly gonna kick you mara leka
Ntwana ya ko kasi, ko phaphakadi
Then she call me “Papi” but I ain't father figure
Oh yeah, I stack til the ceiling
Then blow it through the weekend
Then I make it back, man, basically Modimo O refile
How you feeling ba ba katsa skill-i?
Le mahipi ra ba tlatsa skeemi
It’s an oxymoron, I became a big deal even though I got a crush on Minnie
Ke phela soft but my raps is hard
You should check out my repertoire
I’m a bottom at 16 like fan base a ma Repertoire
(Ai, Nyovest, ha-ha)
What you laughing at, man I ain't say shit
My bitches bad bad no kinda complex, your bitches basic
It’s me and Kool Kat on that 325 and we high like spaceships
We rocking Pieces, bitches puzzled they say “Hi” like spaceship
Cheated on my fears
Broke up with my doubts
Married to my dreams
Carrying the couch
Middle fingers to my exes (Nyovest, Nyovest, Nyovest, Nyovest, Nyovest)
Ring finger to my next chick
Ngwanao ke mo lahli, ke mo gidlelo wa bafayo?
Ooh, that boy bad (Like what?)
Like Dineo Ranaka so

[Verse 2: Okmalumkoolkat]
Yithi Maria, uqhwale iprasiya
MalumKoolKat is a problem, inkinga
If you think you fresh to death, I’m stirred a seizure
BoyznBucks, we always getting mixed up
Wherever that these chicks are, we always gonna feature
Sipping on that mixture, tipping on the tick-up
I’m laying with your sister; she’s pretty as a picture
I call her Mona Lisa; she’s chilling in my t-shirt
(Nka mo dira)
My lips are where her lips are
And her tits are Pyramids of Giza
And I licks her
And I sex her
I’ma fix her, so I fixed her
Then I kissed her, released her
Told her I’ma text her, only when I need her
Now I’m leaning like the Tower of Pisa
Cats wanna catch up, kodwa ndiya bashiya
FYI, I got Air Max in my sneakers
Plus I’m international, ndume njenge pizza
Pac man, Pac man, bonke ndiyaba  gwinya
My only competition is that man in the mirror
Days of your lives, uStefano Dimera, Stefano Dimera
(IGusheshe)
I play Stefano Dimera
Sik'tshelile, there’s nothing like 325!
[Chorus: Cassper Nyovest]
