Ska rebona re phela
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
Ska rebona re phela
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse 1: Kwesta]
We 5 minutes from freedom
Somebody tell my mom I'll be back when I'm cleaner
I'm really close to my dream up
Bebengenandaba, manje iyindaba zami ziyaziwa
Kuyafiwa, tell them I'm a believer
Long walks, now the boy riding out in a Bhima
Nare patlela ao'bena
Bathi akuna space manje izinja zami ziyagiga
Ama Visa, sigijimisa uMadiba
Sabela impilo e-right iyabiza
We were invisible, nobody could see us
Now we in visible and everybody can see us
It's greener, on this other side of the fence brown
The only problem is everybody wanna be friends now
From K1 chasing these gees down
To 1K, but now everybody geed up
We us

[Verse 2: Trouble]
I made it out of the corner
For those who said I wouldn't, look at me man, I'm gone now
Angisho nani niyabona
The way we living it's like heaven nezami siyakora, siya toura
We came a long way from the bottom
Now we're getting shows in the SA all across the border
We 5 minutes from stardom
I thought we would never ever make it this far
I remember chilling with Tech at the back of his room
Talking about "we need to take over the game with a boom"
With a sound that can sweep 'em off their feet like a broom
Makwa comprehended, so we kept this beat in the booth
Passion is the tree we planted, trying to taste its fruit
Always wondered how it's like to sip on Victor with juice
When your dreams finally manifest and they become true
And now we're legends in the making, but again that's the view
Now check it
[Hook]
Ska rebona re phela
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
Ska rebona re phela
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino

O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino

[Verse 3: LTech]
Remember when I told them my dream
They just laughed and said it's far from my reach
Mama stove man left me so ill
I still smell the scent of that paraffin
[???]
I'm steadily reaching my peak now
Be bane bare natjha, bare re nyaka di feature
My fam said "You'll get it if you kneel down
And pray to God he's the only one with the keys now"
He opened doors, TLT got blessed with a deal now
Wena thula ubheke impilo bayishintsha
It's a celebration, please pour me the liqour
I swear to God lana boy akekho ozosithinta, 'Cause
We 5 minutes from glory
And all I ever wanted was to tell 'em my story
Used to sit and wonder, and get caught up in my blues
But now I sit and wonder how I'm gonna spend all my greens bra, we nice
[Chorus]
Ska rebona re phela
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
Ska rebona re phela
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino
O skang potja ka dilo
Kgale re sokola rona re phelela mmino

[Interlude: Kwesta]
See I come from a plartform that was given to me
So if I don't share mine it don't make sense
I had a conversation with Tech
I had a conversation with Trouble

[Verse 4: Kwesta]
Bheka, we 5 minutes from freedom
Somebody tell my mom I'll be back when I'm cleaner
I'm really close to my dream ma
Bebengenandaba, manje iyindaba zami ziyaziwa, kuyafiwa
Tell them I'm a believer
Long walk is not a boy riding out in a Bhima
Nare patlela ao'bena
Bathi akuna space manje izinja zami ziyagiga, ama Visa
Sigijimisa uMadiba
Sabela impil' e-right iyabiza
We were invisible, nobody could see us
Now we in visible and everybody can see us
It's greener, on this other side of the fence brown
The only problem is everybody wanna be friends now
From K1 chasing these Gs down
To 1K, but now everybody Gd up
We us
