Yazi iinyoka ningi lan' egoli
Hlale ngivulle amehlo everywhere langihamba khona
Yazi iinyoka ningi lan' egoli
Hlale ngivulle amehlo everywhere langihamba khona
Supa dupa clean when I pull up, when I pull up
I saw this in my dreams, yeah
Asics on my feet when I pull up, when I pull up
I saw this in my dreams, yeah

[Verse 1]
Wishing you successes
Even though I know you wishing me the opposite
Bekum'nandi kicking me when I was down
Had to focus on the winning, keep it positive
Bobby Brown my prerogative
It was all a dream, oh, it was all a dream
K.O. on the cover of a magazine yea
Riding in the new machine
Ngibe umuntu nami emphakathini
Was a dream ohh
Mina ngiya khumbula, ngiya khumbula
How me and my brothers, used to share the same bed
Memories never faded
Now we all up in the city like
You might also like[Chorus]
Yazi iinyoka ningi lan' egoli
Hlale ngivulle amehlo everywhere langihamba khona
Yazi iinyoka ningi lan' egoli
Hlale ngivulle amehlo everywhere langihamba khona
Supa dupa clean when I pull up, when I pull up
I saw this in my dreams, yeah
Asics on my feet when I pull up, when I pull up
I saw this in my dreams, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hello, hello, hello
Skhanda God, how you doing?
Feeling really good right now
Life is really good right now
Mirror, mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Can you tell me, can you tell me who the realest of them all?
I only do this for the big ba-, big ba-, big bag
Insimbi engagobeki, all my enemies are big mad
I did it for my mama, did it for my daddy
The Mdluli gang is looking good
I did it for the family
Izinja zifun' ukung'use-a, now they tryna be friendly
I swear this city turned me to a savage
Egoli kwa nyama ayipheli
Baningi lana abantu banomona
Bekezela, keep your head up outta water
Ungalilahli ithemba ngoba umdali ukhona
Just pusha pressa uphande ungasabi muntu
Impilo izoba ngcono khona maduze
Bona ukuz'misela kungezelen', bona kungezelen'
I saw this in my dreams
Beka lonk' ithemba lami emthandazweni bona kungezelen'
I saw this in my dreams, yeah
[Chorus]
Yazi iinyoka ningi lan' egoli
Hlale ngivulle amehlo everywhere langihamba khona
Yazi iinyoka ningi lan' egoli
Hlale ngivule amehlo everywhere langihamba khona
Supa dupa clean when I pull up, when I pull up
I saw this in my dreams, yeah
Asics on my feet when I pull up, when I pull up
I saw this in my dreams, yeah

[Outro]
Hello, hello, hello
Skhanda God, how you doing?
Feeling really good right now
Life is really good right now
Hello, hello, hello
Skhanda God, how you doing?
Feeling really good right now
Life is really, life is really good right now
