Being a part of a whole other dimension
Losing your mind
Touching your soul getting lifted
Spirit taking over your senses
Just letting go

[Verse 1: Kid X]
Wa dlala le sgubhu
It's a party took back
Into emnandi singa iphinda
Tshel' uDJ gotta loop that
Bodas mandan' thola njayami kuhle
Ngipheth' imalidlane ngiyaisela
Ngadum umooder
Sithinth' istoep
S'banb' umgani ne impinj
On condition the mpijnj is nuclear
Bashis' intuthu
Ang'zwane na bo phaphios
Ngicela weer us'gaye iskhath' ne space
Ung'bheksize
I love me a pretty thing even if it's a 40 year aesthetic
Ngiyal'fel' ipenjisi
With a waist se stick so menchis
And an ass that's as thick as thieves
Ungenza busy
You're such a tease
Are butle pele
Mina Ngo 2 ingfuna endlini auth' yami
Mara ngo 2 uzomthola anqila iHunter Dry
Athi why kumnandi so
Can't leave I still need my phone to charge
Uthi kimi why kumnandi so
KuLit uzowukhomba umsun' wotshwala
Your friends all hooked up with the squad
Next thing ufun sishay isthombe
Then the phone say bitch the user's outside
Bitch told the Ã¼ber driver kuthi shayi slolo
Ngoba uyazi kumnandi ma ung'thola ngizpholele
Ngiblome nabangan' bami
It's a friday bo ma bodas mandan
Asithole one two ebandayo
S'gcine sichilile
Awu s'nini nini' se ziyakhipha
S'nini nini' seku umcimbi
Ngivuke k'sasa sengithi ang'phindi ngaphinda

It's about losing control of your inhibitions
Being a part of a whole other dimension
Losing your mind
Touching your soul getting lifted
Spirit taking over your senses
Just letting go
