[Verse 1]
Yea!
Life has been a bliss since the mainstream caught on
I’m looking at her physique thinkin' "Ay, she’s the bomb"
A few months ago she called me a lame nigga
Now she can’t wait to tell her friends that I came with her
Even forgot she was hating on me
She don’t know her ABCs so I gave her the D
She ain’t know Amanda Du Pont, she ain’t tailored for me
'Cause I only fuck with women that’s as famous as me
(Ubani ubozza la eKaslam?) Me
Uzophelu moya ungaphaph’ la Breiy
Ne ba di bala ke matsipa
We told them to bump the cheese up
Cocker ntshiza be ba kutsa
Be re tailor re re

[Verse 2]
I told my story (Story) and made a fortune
AKA’s favourite rapper, I guess I made it on the Forbes list
You kinda sorta
No matter what they order
Ha ke sa tseiwa light ga ke complexion ya ga Mshoza
It’s funny when the Twelebs get to actin like Celebs
Used to get frustrated now all I do is get the cash
Ha ke s’buye sa lona jy kaan sommer voetsek
Claming you’re real, you’re little for that (Baka)
Biki baka, sa tlisa makgakga
Mpinji tsaka ke bone ba itseng tsothle dijiti tsaka
Skeem ha’a
Nna le wena ha re di thaka
Change down go kgotlha sedidi saka
[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 3]
(Yeah)
The hype is crazy, they asking me where the album at
Put out two singles that made niggas push their albums back
She said she was on the way but that was 'bout an hour back
I had her butt naked in the pool like "Where the towel at?"
Properly I devoured that
I shouldn’t be that far from it
How could it be that honesty really saved me from poverty?
Thank God
I’m just went through metamorphosis
From chillin' on corners to corner offices
[Pre-Chorus]
I’m out here grindin' with majita (Grindin' with majita)
Money weh, gettin' money man
Ooh ngwanyana bella mpinji tsao (Ngwanyana bella mpinji tsao)
Lebe mthebelele (Mthebelele)
