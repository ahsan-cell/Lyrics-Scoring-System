I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm sorry, I can't afford a Ferrari
But that don't mean I can't get you there
I guess he's an Xbox and I'm more Atari
But the way you play your game ain't fair

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool, that falls in love with you, oh
Oh, shh, she's a gold digger
(Well?) Just thought you should know
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I've got some news for you (Huh-uh)
("Yeah, go run and tell your little boyfriend”)

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

Now I know, that I had to borrow, huh
Beg and steal and lie and cheat
Tryin' to keep ya, tryin' to please ya
'Cause being in love with your *** ain't cheap, nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I pity the fool, that falls in love with you, oh
Oh, shh, she's a gold digger
(Well?) Just thought you should know
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I've got some news for you (Huh-uh)
Ooh, I really hate yo *** right now

[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
And I'm like, "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
Now, baby, baby, baby, why you wanna, wanna hurt me so bad? (So bad, so bad, so bad)
I tried to tell my momma, but she told me, “This is one for your dad”
(Your dad, your dad, your dad)
Yes, she did, and I'm like
Uh, why?
Uh, why?
Uh, why, lady?
Oh, I love you
Oh, I still love you, oh-oh
[Chorus]
I see you drivin' 'round town with the girl I love
Uh, "Forget you" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I guess the change in my pocket wasn't enough
I'm like, "Forget you and forget her too"
Said if I was richer, I'd still be with ya
Hah, now ain't that some shh? (Ain't that some shh?)
And although there's pain in my chest
I still wish you the best
With a "Forget you" (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)15
