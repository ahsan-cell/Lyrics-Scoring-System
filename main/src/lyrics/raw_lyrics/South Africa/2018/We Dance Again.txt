I did a laugh in the middle of a deathly scene
Just to see how far I'd taken it
I did a laugh in war just to be seen
And there and then
I knew what I should have been

Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Aah
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Aah

[Chorus: Nakhane]
That's the one
Come back and see me once again
In the middle of the night you'll be here again
Just to be here by my side again
Come back and see me once again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
That's the one
Come back and see me once again
In the middle of the night you'll be here again
Just to be here by my side again
Come back and see me once again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again

And when I saw you the next day
You told me not to war again
But something dark lies deep within
A blackened tunnel with no light to be seen
But still we dance again

Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Aah
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah
Aah

[Chorus: Nakhane]

That's the one
Come back and see me once again
In the middle of the night you'll be here again
Just to be here by my side again
Come back and see me once again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
That's the one
Come back and see me once again
In the middle of the night you'll be here again
Just to be here by my side again
Come back and see me once again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
Baby, baby, come again
[Verse 3: Nakhane]
Come here I've beckoned you
Or is it that you've beckoned me?
Come here I've beckoned you
Or is it that you've beckoned me?
