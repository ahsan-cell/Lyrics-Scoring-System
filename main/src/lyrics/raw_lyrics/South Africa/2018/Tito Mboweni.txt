I’m tired of catching L's like a fever
I’m tryna change this Tazz into a Beamer
Pop a bottle on a island with a diva
She said she want some more I'ma feed her

[Pre-Hook]
I'ma get it any type of way
If it’s real then you say it to my face
I’m proud to say my niggas are the same
They relate
We do this for the cake
That's that

Young rich nigga
Young rich nigga
I made myself a boss, me a Sim Simma
Man you should see my life, it gets litmus
I used to talk shit and now I’m talking 6 figures
Oh boy I’m G with the shit
You should probably leave your girl
If I’m seen with the bitch
The Philipe e tseisa bana sedidi cause I’m rich
Got a Bentley and a Bentley major league with the whips
(Ntja mme, ntja mme)
Ntja mme, ntja mme, ntja mme
Ntja mme, ntja mme, ntja mme
(Ntja mme, ntja mme)
You know you rich when everybody say you cousins
And all your bitches wanna hold your hand in public
But that shit never fly like I'm Dj Khaled
I’m a problem (Nah, nah, nah)
I’m a big one
Custom watches got a nigga dancing with the wrist up
Out in DBN they love the boy like he Mampintsha
Started at the bottom
Now we feasting on some dim sum

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I’m the man, I’m legit (Bitch)
Just spent 10 on a crib
Bitch I look like a superstar from whatever angle it’s lit
I’m a real nigga with real jewelry
Fuck fake news, fuck fake friends
Tell everybody I’m your very first
And before me you used to hate men
If you don’t, then bitch I’m gone (Gone, gone)
I hop in the 'Rarri (Skrrr, skrrr)
Foot to the floor (Foot to the floor)
I’m rocking Versace (Rocking Versace)
But I smell like Dior (Fah-fah)
Hop in my transie (Hop in my transie)
Kego tsenye dilong (Skrrr, skrrr)
I’m a go-getter
And there’s no better
Zinja zami besi hlupheka
Feeling so set up, by the system
Even wrote letters and approached members
Of the government they won’t help us (Fuck em)
We so fed up
Man we tryna get to Coachella
We got goals phela
Minnie’s married
Amber Rosè better know
That I’m close
And I’m so determined go mo rotela
And I, won’t settle
We will compromise on no level (On no level)
Man I'm tired
[Pre-Hook]
I'ma get it any type of way
If it’s real then you say it to my face
I’m proud to say my niggas are the same
