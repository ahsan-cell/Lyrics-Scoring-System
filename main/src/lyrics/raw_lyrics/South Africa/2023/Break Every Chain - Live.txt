There is power in the name of Jesus
There is power in the name of Jesus
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain
To break every chain, break every chain, break every chain

[Interlude]
Now right here in this moment
I need you to begin to speak to that thing
Come on call it by its name
We come against the spirit of homosexuality
We come against the spirit of rejection and depression
Somebody release it into the atmosphere
That we declare that the chains be broken
Let the chains be broken
The power of life and death
Lies in your tongue
Somebody raise up your voice
(speaking in tongue)
And you declare that the chains are broken
The chains are broken, the chains are broken
The chains are broken, the chains are broken
The chains are broken, the chains are broken
The chains are broken
(speaking in tongue)
[Bridge 2]
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling

[Interlude]

[Outro]
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling
I hear the chains falling...3
