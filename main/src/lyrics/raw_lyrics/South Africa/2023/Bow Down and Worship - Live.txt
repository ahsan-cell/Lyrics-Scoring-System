Before the earth was formed, You are God
We bow before Your throne, oh, God, and
We just wanna give You praise tonight
We just wanna give You praise, we cannot make it without You
And we cannot make it without Your power
Jesus
If it wasn't of Your love and Your faithfulness to the cross, where would we be?
Today, we are able to stand and testify that Your dеath was life unto us
Your pain was healing unto our bodies
That Your tеars, oh, Lord, they were celebration of joy unto us
We thank You, oh, God, that You are in this place tonight
And we are able to experience Your presence
For You are a great God, yes, You are
You're the substance of all human virtues
You're all-wise, and You're all-knowing, all-understanding
You can do anything and every thing we cannot do (Yeah!)
You're everything good that we would like to be
You're omnipotent, You're all-powerful
You're omniscient, You're all-knowing
You're omnipresent, You're present everywhere
And we know that You're present even in this arena
Oh, God, we know that You're in this place
And we want to give You praise
All we can say is, "Abba Father, Thou art worthy to receive honor and glory"
We bow before Your throne, and we would like to give You praise

We bow before Your throne, not because we do not have any other god to bow before
But, because we tried You, and we found You to be worthy of the praise
Whoa, God! Uh, uh
You are an infallible God, You are immortal
You're spirit, You're the beginning, and You're the end
Totally aware of Yourself, You're the Great I Am
Totally moral, totally self-assertive
You're the essence of love, You're loving
We just wanna bow before Your throne and give You the praise
For You're worthy to receive the glory and the honor
We love You, oh, God
We ask You right now to let Your fire come down
Consuming Fire!
