Clarity it's clear to see

[Verse 1]
He said
Enter at your own risk
I am not responsible
For the misery I will bring you
It's just a matter of time
Before I start to destroy you
Let me warn you

[Pre-Chorus]
I said
Take your time boy
Let's see what you got boy
I've dealt with worse boy
Let's see who breaks who first
And you won't be my first time, time

[Chorus]
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed

I should've taken the first shot
But I thought you were something that you're not
I blame it all on my soft spot
'Cause that's the only way that I got caught
But that's not the only reason I'm hurt
I know I should've been way more alert
I cared for you more than anything
And you hurt me more than anything
And that was a heavy thing
You should've known that loving me is a risk
You should've known that breaking my heart is a risk
You broke your own heart
And you played the right part

[Pre-Chorus]
I said
Take your time boy
Let's see what you got boy
I've dealt with worse boy
Let's see who breaks who first
And it won't be my first time, time

[Chorus]
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed
Cry all you need
Just let it bleed2
