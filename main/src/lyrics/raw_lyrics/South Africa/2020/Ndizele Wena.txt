But, I never wanna lose you, I don't want to
Oh baby
Ndithanda wena wedwa
And though it's not always easy
Just know I love you
I really do
Ndingowakho
And all I want you to know

Ndizele wena
Ndizele wena
Ndizele wena, oh oh
Ndizele wena
I'm here just for you

Sometimes I lose my temper
Akekho endimthemba nje ngawe, oh oh
Ngamanye amaxesha
Ndifun ukubaleka
You keep me safe in your arms, my baby
And I just want you to know and trust in me

Ndizele wena
Ndizele wena
Ndizele wena, oh oh oh
I just want you to know
I came here for youYou might also like
