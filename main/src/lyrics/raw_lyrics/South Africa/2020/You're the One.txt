Clarity, it's clear to see

[Verse 1]
I think it's time, we confronted the situation in front of us
And I think it's time, we talk it out and forget all the fuss
And if it's not me, I'll have to understand and I'll be out your way
No drama involved
But if you feel it's me, if you feel I'm the one
You're gonna need to make a way for me to see it

[Chorus]
But as for me you're the one
And in my heart our time will come
'Til the end, I'ma always be right by your side
But as for me you're the one
And in my heart our time will come
'Til the end, I'ma always be right by your side

[Post Chorus]
I know you're the one
I know our time will come
I feel you in my heart
I see you in my dreams
I keep you in my prayers

I think it's time, you admit that I'm the only one for you, yeah
And I think it's time, you let go of all your fears
And just trust me babe 'cause I know your heart
And I know this isn't what you're meant to do
You have pure intentions, what is the issue?
So, just open up and let me see inside
(Maybe you should just put your pride aside)

[Chorus]
But as for me you're the one
And in my heart our time will come
'Til the end, I'ma always be right by your side
But as for me you're the one
And in my heart our time will come
'Til the end, I'ma always be right by your side

[Bridge]
I know we can make it, baby, take a chance on me
Let me show you good times, baby
Take a chance on us
Take a chance on us

[Chorus]
But as for me you're the one
And in my heart our time will come
'Til the end, I'ma always be right by your side
But as for me you're the one
And in my heart our time will come
'Til the end, I'ma always be right by your side
[Post Chorus]
I know you're the one
I know our time will come
I feel you in my heart
I see you in my dreams
I keep you in my prayers3
