Fixate on you
I don't debate with you
I look a way for you
Team player
I lose the way for you
Look amazed for you
Celebrate with you
Team player

[Verse 1: Shekhinah]
Learning to love
Is a story of us
I, tore it down
And I'm learning to love you over again
And again, wish it never ends
If you love me, why you put me through a test?
Tell me why you leave me in a wreck?
Know I only wanna do my best

[Pre-Chorus: Shekhinah]
Baby when I let you crash, really wasn't in my plan
I'm a, team player (Only wanna do my best)
When you let them laugh, still it never made me mad
I'm a, team player

Learning to love you
Love you
Only wanna do
My best to, learn to love you
Know I only wanna
Only wanna do, my best
Learning to love you

[Verse 2: Shekhinah]
My heart's bleeding, you're leaving
Leaving, now you're leaving
But really no escaping truth
What kind of love? (What kind of love?)
Got no time for love (Got no time for love)
There were signs enough (There were signs enough)
'Til our time is up ('Til our time is up)

[Pre-Chorus: Shekhinah]
Baby when I let you crash, really wasn't in my plan
I'm a, team player (Only wanna do my best)
When you let them laugh, still it never made me mad
I'm a, team player

[Chorus: Shekhinah]
Learning to love you
Love you
Only wanna do
My best to, learn to love you
Know I only wanna
Only wanna do, my best
Learning to love you
[Verse 3: Bey T]
Baby, your head made me confused
When you hit me up, it becomes my muse
Nothing else matters, I can't choose
L is for Love, I cannot lose
When you go, I get the blues
Baby me and you, we such a mood
And I don't mean to be rude
Need to switch it up, interlude
And if I never mentioned, ten out of ten we're out of question
Love you so long, can I get an extension?
Learning to love you with all the tension
If you really with it, baby we can go
Coldest in the city, baby we can snow
Boat on the waves, baby we can row
And you got me so high, even when I'm low

[Pre-Chorus: Shekhinah]
Baby when I let you crash, really wasn't in my plan (When I let you crash, crash)
I'm a, team player (When I let you crash)
When you let them laugh, still it never made me mad
I'm a, team player

[Chorus: Shekhinah]
Learning to love you (Team player)
Love you (Team player)
Only wanna do (Team player)
My best to (Team player)
Learn to love you (Team player)
Know I only wanna (Team player)
Only wanna do (Team player)
My best (Team player)
Learning to love you (Team player)
[Outro: Shekhinah]
