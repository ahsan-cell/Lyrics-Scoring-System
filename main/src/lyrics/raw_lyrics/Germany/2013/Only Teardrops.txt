The sky is red tonight
We're on the edge tonight
No shooting star to guide us

[Pre-Chorus]
Eye for an eye
Why tear each other apart?
Please tell me why
Why do we make it so hard?
Look at us now
We only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame

[Chorus]
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops

[Verse 2]
So come and face me now
Here on the stage tonight
Let's leave the past behind us

Look at us now
We only got ourselves to blame
It's such a shame

[Chorus]
Tell me how many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops

[Bridge]
What's come between us?
What's come between us?
Only teardrops
What's come between us?
What's come between us?

[Chorus]
How many times can we win and lose?
How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops
How many times do we have to fight?
How many times till we get it right between us?
Only teardrops
[Post-Chorus]
Only teardrops
Only teardrops

How many times can we break the rules between us?
Only teardrops

How many times till we get it right between us?
