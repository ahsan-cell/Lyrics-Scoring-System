Hey, lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothin’ like you
Hey, lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

[Verse 1]
Girl, let’s go
You sexy thing, you turn me on
I need a private show, here on the lawn, in my garage
I take you on the road, hey, Porsche girl
You know what I wanna do (wanna do)
Come on let me slide under so I can work on, work on you

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna take your top off, celebrate this champagne pop-off
Yeah, we could turn the clocks off
No rush, baby we could just park somewhere
I don't need nobody's permission, yeah
No keys, push start to ignition, say

[Chorus]
Hey, lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothin’ like you
Hey, lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
B-b-back it up, let's roll, roll, roll, roll

Girl, you know
Damn, I've been dreamin’ ‘bout the day you let me take you home
Just for a week and maybe more, just sayin’
See I never seen an ass like that
You gon' make a nigga crash like that
Since I seen you in the window, knew what I was in for
Spendin’ every rack on that

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna take your top off, celebrate this champagne pop-off
Yeah, we could turn the clocks off
No rush, baby we could just park somewhere
I don't need nobody's permission, yeah
No keys, push start to ignition, say

I wanna see how fast you can go
See how you handle as I'm cruisin’ control
As I make you turn around
Hey, let me turn up your sound
T-t-turn it up and now here we go

[Chorus]
Hey, lil' Porsche, I wanna try ya
Crazy baby girl, there ain't nothin’ like you
Hey, lil' Porsche, so right I had to get ya
