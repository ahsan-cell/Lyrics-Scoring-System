[Verse 1]
Run, boy, run! This world is not made for you
Run, boy, run! They're trying to catch you
Run, boy, run! Running is a victory
Run, boy, run! Beauty lies behind the hills

[Verse 2]
Run, boy, run! The sun will be guiding you
Run, boy, run! They're dying to stop you
Run, boy, run! This race is a prophecy
Run, boy, run! Break out from society

[Chorus]
Tomorrow is another day
And you don't have to hide away
You'll be a man, boy
But for now, it's time to run, it's time to run

[Verse 3]
Run, boy, run! This ride is a journey to
Run, boy, run! The secret inside of you
Run, boy, run! This race is a prophecy
Run, boy, run! And disappear in the trees
You might also like[Chorus]
Tomorrow is another day
And you don't have to hide away
You'll be a man, boy
But for now, it's time to run, it's time to run

[Outro]
Tomorrow is another day
And when the night fades away
You'll be a man, boy
But for now, it's time to run, it's time to run33
