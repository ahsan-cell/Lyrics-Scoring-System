I’m running around and I'm stuck in the phase yeah
Been like this lately, oh-oh
I need a doctor to give me a shot so I no longer suffer
And I need a lawyer, oh-oh

'Cause I’ve not been too good this time
People say I lost my mind
And I shouldn't be hanging with you
No I don't care 'bout what they say
That don't mean nothing to me
Nobody can do what you do

You take me even higher than I have ever been
I'm moving to your rhythm, oh, I feel it in my skin
We're never getting sober, we're always letting go
Still moving to your rhythm, it’s the only thing we know
It’s the only thing we know

You take me even higher than I have ever been
I'm moving to your rhythm, oh, I feel it in my skin
We’re never getting sober, we're always letting go
Still moving to your rhythm, it's the only thing we know
It's the only thing we know

You’re like a spider
Spinning a web that is full of your lying
I'm disqualifying you
You're just like Bonnie
And I'm just like Clyde and you know that you got me
Well maybe it might be true
You might also like'Cause I've not been too good this time
People say I lost my mind

No I don't care 'bout what they say

You take me even higher than I have ever been
I'm moving to your rhythm, oh, I feel it in my skin
We're never getting sober, we're always letting go
Still moving to your rhythm, it's the only thing we know
It's the only thing we know

And I don't ever want to come back down
No I don't ever want, no I don't ever want
To come back down

'Cause you take me even higher than I have ever been
I'm moving to your rhythm, oh, I feel it in my skin
We're never getting sober, we're always letting go
