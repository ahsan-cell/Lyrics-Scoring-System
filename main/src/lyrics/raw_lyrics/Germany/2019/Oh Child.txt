Oh child, will you ever get by?
Will you listen to things I say?
Will you know the difference from your wrong or right?
Will you learn it along the way?
Si sientes que te fallan los pies al caminar
¿Volveras de nuevo a levantarte o en el suelo te quedaras?

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Schulz, Piso 21]
And I know that I can't pretend, that I haven't had my regrets
From the memories that I've kept, to the history I forget
Entiende que en la vida das un paso a la vez
Oh child, just do what you love, 'cause you won't get this life again

[Chorus: Robin Schulz]
Oh child, oh child, no, no, no, don't you worry
Oh child, oh child, I know you'll be okay
Oh child, oh child, no, you won't get this life again
Oh child, oh child, no, you won't get this life again

[Verse 2, Piso 21, Robin Schulz]
Cuida el amigo que te mereces
Cuida el amor que te pertenece
Vive feliz, no importa mañana
Siempre sincero y siempre real
Mira que la vida pasa y no te das cuenta
No pierdas el tiempo, confía en la experiencia
No, no, no cometas mis errores
Mira que se pagan caro las consecuencias
No, no, no, no, don't you worry

Oh child, oh child, no, no, no, don't you worry
Oh child, oh child, I know you'll be okay
Oh child, oh child, no, you won't get this life again
Oh child, oh child

[Verse 3: Piso 21, Robin Schulz]
Llegaran traiciones, perderas la fe
Pero no lo tomes personal, ya sabras en quién creer
Oh child, maybe you can find love with a husband, or a wife
If you're happy when the road is getting rough
I'll be happy there by your side

[Pre-Chorus: Robin Schulz, Piso 21]
And I know that I can't pretend that I haven't had my regrets
From the memories that I've kept, to the history I forget
Entiende que en la vida das un paso a la vez
Oh child, just do what you love, 'cause you won't get this life again

[Outro: Robin Schulz]
No, you won't get this life again
No, you won't get this life again
Oh child, oh child
Oh child, oh child
Oh child, oh child, no, no, no, don't you worry
Oh child, oh child, no, you won't get this life again
Ay yeah, ay yeah, ay yeah
