Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo, woo

[Verse 1]
Now I know how to get down on the floor (Floor)
Experienced in moves you can't ignore ('Nore)
But something 'bout this beat that's got me hooked (Hooked)
Come over here and take a closer look (Look)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
You might also like[Verse 2]
I do this just for kicks, just for the thrill (Thrill)
I got this high without takin' a pill (Pill)
This groove has got me way over the sun (Sun)
I'm dancin' like I am the only one (One)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I can't get enough, I can't get enough
I can't stay on the ground
Whoa, I can't get enough, I can't get enough
This is taking me now

[Chorus]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Post-Chorus]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo

[Bridge]
The music's got me going higher
I feel like I can touch the sky
[Chorus]
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground
It's taking me higher, higher
Higher off the ground

[Outro]
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
Woo, woo
