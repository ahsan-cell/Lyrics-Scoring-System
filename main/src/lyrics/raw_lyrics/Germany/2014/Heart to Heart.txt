There are times when I don't know where I stand (Woah sometimes!)
You make me feel like I'm a boy and not a man (Woah sometimes!)
There are times when you don't give me a smile (Woah sometimes!)
I'll lie awake at night and worry for a while (Woah, woah!)

[Chorus: James Blunt]
It's ok, cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day
And I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart

[Verse 2: James Blunt]
There are times when I cry, cause you shed no tears
And I'm so far away, but your body's right here
There are times when I just walked out your door
And thought I'd never get to see you anymore

[Chorus: James Blunt]
It's ok, cause I know
You shine even on a rainy day
And I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart

[Outro: James Blunt]
Wherever you fall
If you need a hand to hold
I'll come running, because
You and I won't part till we die
You should know
We see eye to eye, heart to heart

I can find your halo
Guides me to wherever you fall3
