Tell me, baby, what we gonna do?
I'll make it easy, got a lot to lose
Watch the sunlight coming through
Open the window, let it shine on you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine (Hey)
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy (Hey)
You can't take it, all these faces
Never keepin' it real
I know exactly how you feel

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down

[Post-Chorus]
(Hoo) Oh, oh, I will never let you down
(Hoo) Oh, oh, I will never let you down

There's a million ways to go
Don't be embarrassed if you lose control
On the rooftop, now you know
Your body's frozen and you've lost your soul

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been sick and working all week
And I've been doing just fine (Hey)
You've been tired of watching me
Forgot to have a good time, boy (Hey)
You can't take it, all these faces
Never keepin' it real (Yeah, yeah)
I know exactly how you feel

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down

[Post-Chorus]
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, hoo) Oh, oh, I will never let you down
(Hoo) Oh, oh, I will never let you down
[Bridge]
Let me take you where you never go
Have a little fun, it's the only way we know
Let me show you what you never see
You know how to love, only when you're holding me (Oh)

[Chorus]
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down (Oh)
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
Oh, oh, I will never let you down (Oh)
When you say you've had enough
And you might just give it up
Oh, oh, I will never let you down (Oh)
When you're feeling low on love
I'll be what you're dreaming of
I will never let you down30
