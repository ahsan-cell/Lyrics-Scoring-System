The odds are you can't even tell the mixing board is a holy grail
For styles like this only for those who know it well
It's unknown but won't fail
Another stone for Thanos to unveil requiring control skill
Mix without crashing Zig-Zag-Allah autopilot passengers
Hypnotized by the magic practice
Pragmatic practicalist poetry in motion by accident
And cry like I never asked for this
The experiment for buzz, that's what Hip Hop was
I stutter and s-s-s-shit on you cuz
The great Pun breath control vernacular
Ginger extract with cold press Canibus oil so elaborate
Asymmetric encryption eyeballs scan screen
DJ Deep State book the false flag for the weekend
Mind control me me tu tiene
MK Ultra beam as Tone & Poke had two M3 two-seaters

What are the odds this is all a design
What are the odds if this is all in my mind
What are the odds that these thoughts aren't mine
What are the odds that I'll make it out alive
What are the odds we were created to survive
What are the odds they created us so we die
What are the odds that we're gods and they lied
But what are the odds?
What are the odds?

The whole world is mine, every continent, especially Africa
This is America, lone wolf alpha puff stare at ya
Tear at your flesh, devouring your character
Father do not forgive them, they know what they do
Military tribunal, lock load and shoot
The Garden of Eden is guarded by a demons
Drug addicted heathens of barbarous believers
Semiramis belus, Nimrod ninus
