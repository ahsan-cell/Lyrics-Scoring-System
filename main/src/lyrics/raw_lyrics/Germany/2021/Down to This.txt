Let's go

[Bridge: 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow?
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire 'cause Shady said so
I'm on fire (Here we go now)

[Verse 1: Eminem, Tony Yayo & DJ Green Lantern]
Everybody's in a rush to try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone (Come on)
I ain't tryin' to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone (Exclusive)
And I ain't even tryin' to go there with record sales
I'm just tryin' to keep it humble and respect myself (Yeah)
Say, "What up?", keep steppin', and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail and livin' reckless
But if you go check my belt, you may see something else I use to protect myself (Yeah)
A vest, to stop a Ruger and deflect the shells (Green Lantern)
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line (Uh-huh)
But this motherfucker Ja must've lost his mind (Woo)
That X got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael?
Just keep singin' that same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie dance to your songs, we like you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth (Uh-huh)
Come on now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride, dog, and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to
With syllable after syllable I just slap ya
Killin' you faster than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it, you got it
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta (Green Lantern)
We bump heads with any motherfucker that wants to (Woo; yeah)
So what's the deal? Where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, "Ja, what up, dog?"
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there with all your men
We could've solved it then
I'm a grown man, dog, come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
Come on

I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk, but soon we gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me

You know you don't want it with me
You can talk, but soon we gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Tony)
[Verse 2: Tony Yayo & Eminem]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you (What?)
Ja, you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week, I'm buyin' a new pistol (Woo)
I clap at your ass with this chrome .38
And put six through your hats, a seven and 3/8s (Come on)
Irv, you ain't Suge Knight, you Shook Knight
I'll put my knife in your windpipe and breeze on the turnpike
You know and I know who took your chain
You got robbed two times, so your ass a lame (Lame)
I'm down to die for this shit, all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Segal (Steven Segal, bitch!) (Come on)

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk, but soon we gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me
You know you don't want it with me
You can talk, but soon we gon' see
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Lloyd Banks)
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks, Tony Yayo, Lloyd Banks & Tony Yayo]
Man, fuck that, I'm tired of waitin'
These industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out your man (What?)
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised blowin' chocolate up out the van, and (Break it, break it, break it down, uh)
They see me pop up more icy, 'cause I could (What?)
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood, good (Haha)
'Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it with us and half of your artists got makeup on?
Every magazine I open, you on your knees takin' prayer pictures (Yeah)
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nuttin' 'bout what pain is, sucker
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, motherfucker (Yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent, DJ Green Lantern, 50 Cent & Tony Yayo]
I know you don't want it with me (That's my man Paul Rosenberg)
You know you don't want it with me (Marc LaBelle)
You can talk, but soon we gon' see (Shady Records)
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Don Robinson)
I know you don't want it with me (Interscope Worldwide)
You know you don't want it with me (Look out for the tour)
You can talk, but soon we gon' see (Anger Management)
You don't wanna bump heads with me (Europe and Japan)

[Outro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah, nigga!
Yeah, Shady, Aftermath!
G-Unit!
Fuck you think they call us G-Unit for?
'Cause we move units
Uh-huh
