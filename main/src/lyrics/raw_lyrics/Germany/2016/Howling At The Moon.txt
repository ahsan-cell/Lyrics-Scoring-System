Where did the summer go? I found it in Monaco
Dancing in Mexico, sushi in Tokyo
I wanna be where you are, driving a classic car
Cuba is not so far, I can bring my guitar

[Chorus]
Baby, are we there yet? Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there, but until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Baby, are we there yet? Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you and you'll get there, but until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

[Post-Chorus]
Awoooh
Howling at the moon
Awoooh
Howling at the moon

[Verse 2]
Where is the summertime? Take me back to Hawaii
Skyscrapers in Dubai, palaces in Versailles
So won't you fly with me? Have dinner in Sicily?
Be who you wanna be, right where you wanna be

Baby, are we there yet? Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there, but until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Baby, are we there yet? Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there, but until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

Baby, are we there yet? Meet me at the sunset
Summer will be over soon
I'll see you when you get there, but until we get there
We'll be howling at the moon

[Post-Chorus]
Awoooh
Howling at the moon
Awoooh
Howling at the moon
Howling at the moon
Awoooh
Howling at the moon1
