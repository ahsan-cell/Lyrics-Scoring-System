Remember the feeling of my fingertips on your skin?
And the way that our kisses taste sweeter by the drinking
And the way that I rage into your love, why you breathe me in?
Just so you can feel me with your way when I'm not around

[Chorus]
Don’t forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don’t forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love

[Verse 2]
Tantrum, set fire, two dice, we roll, excite
Your eyes, inhale the love
Play in the dark, rules break, why pretend?
We take what we can, we ride 'til the end, 'til the sun
Push that weight on me like a fiend, let's rage in the moonlight
Calm, like a shot rings out in the darkness

[Chorus]
So you don’t forget my love
Don’t forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don’t forget, don't forget, don't forget, don't forget, don’t, don't, don't, don't
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my love
My love, my love
Love, my love, my love
Don't forget my love
My love, my love
Love, my love, my love
Don't forget my love
Don't forget my loveYou might also like21
