(My love, my love, my love)
(My love, my love, my love)

I just wanna hold you close
I wanna breathe in all your chemicals
But they′re flammable
Never get the chemistry right
Now we're blowing up in the night, night

I know that you feed me lies
And I keep swallowing them every time
Just to say your mine
Never been that good with pain
It′s easier to walk away

Why?
Why?
Why? Why? Why?

Why do I always choose somebody
Who's gonna make a mess out of me?
Oh, God, what's wrong with me?
My love don′t come easy
Every time I fall from grace
It′s all the way from out of space
Oh, God, what's wrong with me?
My love don′t come easy
You might also likeI just wanna say the words
But I still wait for you to say 'em first
Then the bubble burst
Always tryna fall too far
Then I hit the ground too hard

I want something more than a weekend
Someone who can dive in the deep end
I just wanna know from the start
That everything I need′s what you are

Why do I always choose somebody
Who's gonna make a mess out of me?
Oh, God, what′s wrong with me?
My love don't come easy
Every time I fall from grace
It's all the way from out of space
Oh, God, what′s wrong with me?
My love, it don′t come easy

(My love, my love, my love)
I don't know what′s wrong with (my love, my love, my love)
Don't know where I′m going (my love, my love, my love)
My love, no it don't come easy
(My love, my love, my love)
And if we′re being honest (my love, my love, my love)
Oh, it's already broken (my love, my love, my love)
My love, ooh1
