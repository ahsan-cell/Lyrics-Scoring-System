Obvious, it's so obvious
Burnin' secrets in the dark
Can't deny two beatin' hearts
Close enough, we ain't close enough
Gettin' ready to let go on my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know what I'm doin'
Feelin' our bodies movin'
And all my senses fade into the night
We are fallin' to the deep end
Tremblin', hardly breathin'
Hold me as I'm drownin' in your eyes

[Chorus]
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I
Na-na-na, I'm blinded by the lights
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I
Couldn't stop it even if I tried

[Post-Chorus]
Doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our—

Magnets, we're like magnets
Pull me in, don't let me go
Meet me in the afterglow
Close the door, no one has to know
I can't hide that I'm blinded by the lights

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't know what I'm doin'
Feelin' our bodies movin'
And all my senses fade into the night
We are fallin' to the deep end
Tremblin', hardly breathin'
Hold me as I'm drownin' in your eyes
Doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our bodies—
Hold me as I'm drownin' in your eyes

[Chorus]
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I
Na-na-na, I'm blinded by the lights
I-I-I (I), I-I-I, I-I
Couldn't stop it even if I tried
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I
Na-na-na, I'm blinded by the lights
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I
Couldn't stop it even if I tried
[Post-Chorus]
Doin'
Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our—

Feelin' our bodies doin'
Feelin' our —
