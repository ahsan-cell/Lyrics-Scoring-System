Give me your love 'cause I’m here to stay
The bones in my body tell me I shouldn't wait
You are dancing around me every night and day
So, I'm gonna let you know, I’m never letting go

[Verse 1]
Can't fix what is broken
I know that we made some mistakes
A ghost chasing us from the past
But we were built to last

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess we were hoping
To figure out a way to move on
We went left when we were supposed to go right, yeah
This timе I won't let you down

[Chorus]
Give me your lovе 'cause I'm here to stay
The bones in my body tell me I shouldn't wait
You are dancing around me every night and day
So, I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go

[Drop]
I’m gonna let you know, I’m never letting go
I'm gonna let you know, I’m never letting go
I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go

Now it's out in the open, yeah
We just can’t let the days pass us by
We messed it up and cleaned it up, built like new
This time I can't let you down

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess we were hoping
To figure out a way to move on
We went left when we were supposed to go right, yeah
This time I won't let you down

[Chorus]
Give me your love 'cause I'm here to stay
The bones in my body tell me I shouldn't wait
You are dancing around me every night and day
So, I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go

[Bridge]
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting go
So, I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go

[Drop]
I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go
I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go
[Outro]
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting go
I'm never letting go
So, I'm gonna let you know, I'm never letting go
