I remember everything
The picnic in the park
How the rain played on the roof that night
And movies in the dark
I know you're so afraid to sing
But baby that's my favourite sound
I love all these little things
That make who you are

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know that we're so far apart
I see your face when I look to the stars
Oh I

[Chorus]
I'm so far from perfect
I get so insecure
But you pour holy water
Over all of my flaws
And I'll always be heartless
'Cause it’ll always be yours
On your coldest of nights babe
I'll be there keeping you warm
I'll be there keeping you warm
You might also like[Verse 2]
I notice how your top lip shakes
Whenever you're mad
I can tell just when that smile is fake
I know that's when your sad
And all these little memories
Play me like a melody
But I don't want this song to end
It belongs to you and me

[Chorus]
I'm so far from perfect
I get so insecure
But you pour holy water
Over all of my flaws
And I'll always be heartless
It’ll always be yours
On your coldest of nights babe
I'll be there keeping you warm
I'll be there keeping you warm

[Bridge: Vocalizing]

[Chorus]
I'm so far from perfect
I get so insecure
But you pour holy water
Over all of my flaws
And I'll always be heartless
It’ll always be yours
On your coldest of nights babe
I'll be there keeping you warm
I'll be there keeping you warm
[Outro]
I'll be there keeping you warm
I'll be there keeping you warm
