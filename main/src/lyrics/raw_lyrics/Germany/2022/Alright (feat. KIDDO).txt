I'll be alright
It's gonna hurt me for a while, but I'll be fine
I might go crazy and I'll fall into the night
I'll try to forget you with a stranger by my side
But in time

[Verse 1]
We said that this is forever
Wake me up, say it's a dream
Everything's better together
Guess we were never meant to be
Wake me up when this is over
Cut me off so I can heal
Drunk on love like we were never sober
I knew I had to let it be

[Chorus]
I'll be alright
It's gonna hurt me for a while, but I'll be fine
I might go crazy and I'll fall into the night
I'll try to forget you with a stranger by my side
But in time
I'll be alright
It's gonna burn me for a while, but I'll be fine
I might get wasted 'cause I'm lonely deep inside
I'm gonna miss you and it's gonna make me cry
But in time
I'll be alright

Feels like I'm runnin' in circles
I need you here to lead me out
Guess that I just hope for a miracle
I wish that you were with me now

[Chorus]
I'll be alright
It's gonna hurt me for a while, but I'll be fine
I might go crazy and I'll fall into the night
I'll try forget you with a stranger by my side
But in time
I'll be alright

[Bridge]
Be alright, be alright, be alright
I'll be alright
Be alright, be alright, be alright (I'll be alright)

[Chorus]
I'll be alright
It's gonna burn me for a while, but I'll be fine
I might get wasted 'cause I'm lonely deep inside
I'm gonna miss you and it's gonna make me cry
But in time
I'll be alright
[Post-Chorus]
Be alright, be alright (I'll be alright), be alright
I might get wasted 'cause I'm lonely deep inside
Be alright, be alright (I'll be alright), be alright
I'll be alright

[Outro]
Be alright, be alright
