I can't be the only who takes you home
Oh, you've been out with everyone, you can't sleep alone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
I'ma do the same, see how you do it
I'ma do the same thing

[Chorus]
I was thinking you were leaving
Every weekend so deceiving
On an island, I decided
To let you go

[Buildup]
To let you go

[Drop]
To let you go
To let you go
To let you go
To let you go
Let you, let you go
Let you, let you go
Let you, let you go
Let you, let you go
You might also like[Verse 2]
It feels like you're somewhere else when
I hold you close, no
You've been out doing the most when
I need you most, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
I'ma do the same thing that you been doing
You can call it love but I see right through it
Two can play the same game

[Chorus]
I was thinking you were leaving
Every weekend so deceiving
On an island, I decided
To let you go

[Drop]
To let you go
To let you go
To let you go
To let you go
Let you, let you go
Let you, let you go
Let you, let you go
Let you, let you go
[Outro]
I can't be the only who takes you home
