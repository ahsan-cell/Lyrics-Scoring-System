Drive me to drink, I'm drinking kisses, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Every step you take
Everyone ever knew ya
Sing, "Hallelujah" (Woah)

[Chorus]
Because when you go low, and I get higher
When you move back slow, it lights my fire
I might be falling for ya, I don't know (High)
I think it might be what you came here for (Woah)
When you go low, and I get higher
When you move back slow, it lights my fire
I'm at attention, I ain't got no shame (High)
No inhibition, I'm just glad you came (Woah)

[Verse 2]
(Ahoo) Take a step into the light and flaunt it
(Ahoo) Leavin' everybody broken hearted
(Ahoo-hoo-hoo) God, it's a sauna, so hot
The way you slide across the floor
I think you know
That I'm only gonna beg for more

[Bridge]
Stuck in this game you've started
Don't leave me broken hearted
'Cause I've got nothing left to lose (Woah)
