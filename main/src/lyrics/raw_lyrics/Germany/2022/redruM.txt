Done done done, done done do-done
Done done done, done done

[Verse 1]
Emergency room, they said bruises on the heart
What can I do, I tried everything so far
I called 911 from a telephone booth
I said "Help her, she's dying from hearing the truth!"
I made her suffer, have you read the news
That she had a lover and I love him too

[Pre-Chorus]
What goes around comes back around
Sorry that he chose me now
What goes around comes back around
Can't you hear, she's crying out

[Chorus]
RedruM, redrum
Look what I did, look what I've done, done
RedruM, redrum
I took his heart, is that so wrong
She's done done done, done done do-done
Done done done, done done do-done
She's done done done, done done do-done
Crying redrum, redrum

Blood on the street, rumors spreading really fast
They talk about me, like I've done something so bad
I called 911 from a telephone booth
I said "Help her, she's dying from hearing the truth!"
Stop all the talking now, stop all the news
They love to judge me, ain't got any proof

[Pre-Chorus]
What goes around comes back around
Sorry that he chose me now
What goes around comes back around
Can't you hear, she's crying out

[Chorus]
RedruM, redrum
Look what I did, look what I've done, done
RedruM, redrum
I took his heart, is that so wrong
She's done done done, done done do-done
Done done done, done done do-done
She's done done done, done done do-done
Crying redrum, redrum

[Chorus]
RedruM, redrum
Look what I did, look what I've done, done
RedruM, redrum
I took his heart, is that so wrong
She's done done done, done done do-done
I took her lover and that he's gone
She's done done done, done done do-done
Crying redrum, redrum
[Outro]
RedruM, redrum
RedruM, redrum
