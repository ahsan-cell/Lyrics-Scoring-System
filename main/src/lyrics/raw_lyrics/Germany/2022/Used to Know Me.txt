You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
You, you, you, you

[Verse 1]
You had me 'round your finger, you had me on the floor
I used to be your angel, now I'm walking out your door
You say I'm turnin' evil, I'll say I'm finally pure
Shine bright in my reflection, think I lost myself before

[Pre-Chorus]
Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life, 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standin' in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

[Chorus]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy
I'm finally free from your control
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh

I'm like a flower blooming since I left you behind
Don't know what I was doing, thought your venom was divine
Knew you were turnin' evil, you said I lost my mind
No, you ain't gonna do me like that-at-at-at

[Pre-Chorus]
Held me back, tied me up inside a cage
Had to change my life, 'cause I knew you'd stay the same
Couldn't see you were standing in my way
I can see clearly now, now, now

[Chorus]
You used to know me, now you don't
You used to hypnotize me, did it so easy (So)
I'm finally free from your control (Control)
I don't need a kiss goodbye, I'm on my own tonight, oh
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
