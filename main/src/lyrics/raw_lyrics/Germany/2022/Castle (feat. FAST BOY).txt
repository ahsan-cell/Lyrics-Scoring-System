[Intro]
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na, na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na)

[Verse 1]
We could build a castle, we could touch the sky
Flying high like NASA, past the end of time
But you know I get lonely with memories at night
We're two worlds apart, but you're always on my mind
We could build a castle, we could touch the sky
Flying high like NASA, past the end of time
But you know I get lonely with memories at night
We're two worlds apart, but you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na

[Verse 2]
This could all be ours, a world where we decide
But nothing really matters, if I can't say you're mine
Your name is in the stars and you'rе like my guiding light
We're two worlds apart, but you'rе always on my mind
We could build a castle, we could touch the sky
Flying high like NASA, past the end of time
But you know I get lonely with memories at night
We're two worlds apart but you're always on my mind

Always on my mind (Always on my mind)
Always on my mind (Always on my mind)
Always on my mind (Always on my mind)
Always on my mind

[Chorus]
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)
Na-na-na-na-na, na, na-na-na-na (Na-na-na)

[Outro]
We could build a castle, we could touch the sky
Flying high like NASA, past the end of time
But you know I get lonely with memories at night
We're two worlds apart, but you're always on my mind
