Ladies
Can I talk to y'all for a minute?
Yes

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg]
Ready, set, stand where the light be
You know it's lit when it's Snoop Dogg and Heidi
The walk mean, fierce, feisty
Girl, you're hot and you're sweet like chai tea

[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
You say I'm always high
We keep that on the low
Flossy, it's a fun day on the runway, you can let it go

[Chorus: Heidi Klum & Snoop Dogg, Both]
When I give my heart again, I know
It's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when, I know
It's gonna last forever
When I fall in love again, I know
It's gonna last forever
(One) Forеver, forever (Two), forеver, forever
(Three) Forever, forever
It's gonna last forever (One, two, three, let's go!)

No one tell me where or when, 'cause I know

[Refrain: Snoop Dogg]
Ready, set, stand where the light be
You know it's lit when it's Snoop Dogg and Heidi
The walk mean, fierce, feisty
Girl, you're hot and you're sweet like chai tea

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
After the show we can kick it like tai chi
Me and you in the mood, that's likely
Get your dance on, baby, entice me
I'm in the cut, but you know where to find me

[Chorus: Heidi Klum & Snoop Dogg, Both]
When I fall in love again, I know
It's gonna last forever
(One) Forever, forever (Two), forever, forever
(Three) Forever, forever
It's gonna last forever (One, two, three, let's go!)
[Drop: Heidi Klum & Snoop Dogg]
(Forever)
Heidi, sing!
When I give my heart again, yes, I know
It's gonna last forever
No one tell me where or when, 'cause I know
It's gonna last forever

Yes, yes
Yes, yes, yes, yes
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh (Yeah)
(One, two, three, let's go!)
