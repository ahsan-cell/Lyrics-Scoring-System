Lied to my face
I’m losing track of every tongue that I taste
It’s like the whole world is upside down
Can’t even tell if this is real right now
Heads in the sky
We’re gonna fly around with flames in our eyes
Just gonna laugh about it all night long
Somebody’s gonna have to carry me home

[Chorus]
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don’t remember
Don’t remember, don’t remember, oh
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don’t remember
Don’t remember, don’t remember, oh

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Lung’s coming up
Can’t even think about it
Dreams in a cup
Just wanna dance about it
Lose our minds
Just wanna dance about it
Lose our minds
Lied to my face
I’m losing track of every tongue that I taste
Just wanna laugh about it all night long
Somebody’s gonna have to carry me home
You might also like[Chorus]
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don’t remember
Don’t remember, don’t remember, oh
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don’t remember
Don’t remember, don’t remember, oh

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don’t remember
Don’t remember, don’t remember, oh
Bad ideas make the best memories
Even if you don’t remember
Don’t remember, don’t remember, oh
