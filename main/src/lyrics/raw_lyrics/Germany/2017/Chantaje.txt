(Rudeboyz)

[Verse 1: Maluma]
When you’re doing good, you get away from me
You feel alone, and I’m always there
It’s a war of give and take
Well give me some of what you got there
Hey baby, don’t be mean (Oh, no)
Don’t leave me with the desire
It's heard on the street that you no longer love me
Come and say it to my face

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & Maluma]
Ask who you want to
My life, I swear it's not like that
I never had a bad intention
I never wanted to make fun of you
With me, you see, you never know
One day I say no, and the other yes
I'm a masochist
With my body, an egoist

[Chorus: Shakira, Maluma & Both]
You are pure, pure blackmail
Pure, pure blackmail
It's always your way
I want you even if I don't want to
You are pure, pure blackmail
Pure, pure blackmail
You go free like the wind
I’m not yours, nor anybody else’s
You might also like[Verse 2: Maluma & Shakira]
How you tempt me when you move
Those sexy moves always entertain me
You know how to manipulate me with your hips
I don’t know why you got me on a waiting list
They tell you around here that I’m doing and undoing
That I go out every night, that I got you there suffering
That, in this relationship, I’m the one who’s in charge
Don’t pay attention to all that bad propaganda

[Bridge: Shakira & Maluma]
Why, why even tell you anything, they eat your ear
Don't go straightening what has not been twisted
And like a madman, I'm still behind you, dying for you
Tell me what there is for me, baby (What?)

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira & Maluma]
Ask who you want to
My life, I swear it's not like that
I never had a bad intention
I never wanted to make fun of you
With me, you see, you never know
One day I say no, and the other yes
I'm a masochist
With my body, an egoist
[Chorus: Shakira, Maluma & Both]
You are pure, pure blackmail
Pure, pure blackmail
It's always your way
I want you even if I don't want to
You are pure, pure blackmail
Pure, pure blackmail
You're free like wind
I’m not yours, nor anybody else’s

[Post-Chorus: Shakira & Maluma, Shakira]
Eh-eh-eh, anybody
Eh-eh-eh, anybody
Eh-eh-eh, anybody (Anybody, anybody)
With my body, an egoist

[Chorus: Shakira, Maluma & Both]
You are pure, pure blackmail
Pure, pure blackmail
It's always your way
I want you even if I don't want to
You are pure, pure blackmail
Pure, pure blackmail
You're free like wind
I’m not yours, nor anybody else’s
[Post-Chorus: Shakira & Maluma, Shakira]
Eh-eh-eh, anybody
Eh-eh-eh, anybody
Eh-eh-eh, anybody (Anybody, anybody)
Eh-eh-eh-eh, eh, eh

[Outro: Maluma & Shakira]
Hahaha, alright, alright baby

You're my baby loba (Rudeboyz), yeah (Uh-uh)
Colombia, you feel me?
Pretty boy
