Just how many moments took your breath away
And it doesn't matter how many times you cried
Just how many reasons you find to smile

It's ok, mmh -- It's all right

Well, it doesn't matter how many times you fall
Just as long as you get up standing tall
And it doesn't matter if the world don't care what you do
Just as long as it's the world to you

Just hold on
Yeah, keep on and on and on

Digging in the dirt
Looking for gold
Getting through the hurt
For something to hold
In every single word
Let the story be told
Digging in the dirt
Digging in the dirt
To find some soul -- uoooh

It doesn't matter if you're stuck deep in the mud
Just as long as you will keep your head up
And it's getting better as time goes by you will see
There's a new turn at the end of the street
You might also likeJust walk on
Mmh yeah, keep on and on and on

Keep on
Keep on...
