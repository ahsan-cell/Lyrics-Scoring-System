You, you who has smiled when you're in pain
You who has soldiered through the profane
They were distracted and shut down
So why, why would you talk to me at all?
Such words were dishonorable and in vain
Their promise as solid as the fog

[Pre-Chorus]
And where was your watchman then?

[Chorus]
I'll be your keeper for life, as your guardian
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian

[Verse 2]
You, you in the chaos feigning sane
You who was pushed beyond what's humane
Them as a ghostly tumbleweed

[Pre-Chorus]
And where was your watchman then?

[Chorus]
I'll be your keeper for life, as your guardian
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian
You might also like[Verse 3]
Now no more smiling mid crestfall
No more managing unmanageables
No more holding still in the hailstorm

[Pre-Chorus]
Now enter your watch woman

[Chorus]
I'll be your keeper for life, as your guardian
I'll be your warrior of care, your first warden
I'll be your angel on call, I'll be on demand
The greatest honor of all, as your guardian5
