Oh, oh, oh and I
I put a wish in
Made it my mission
To end the conflict
But oh
I put a wish in
Hoping you'd listen
Be my accomplice
But oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Relax, it's only dreaming facts
Giving way to feelings
No one ever stays long
It's over when you wake up

[Chorus]
So I knew that it was
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was, I made it stronger

[Verse 2]
From the beginning
My head was spinning
The perfect start
And oh, oh, oh, a church
A place to fit in
A new religion
I found your heart
Uh-oh-uh-oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Relax, it's only dreaming facts
Giving way to feelings
No one ever stays long
It's over when you wake up

[Chorus]
So I knew that it was
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was, I made it stronger
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was, I made it stronger

[Post-Chorus]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm

[Bridge]
Don't get mad
You did your best
And now it's all in the past to stay

[Chorus]
So I knew that it was
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was, I made it stronger
In the picture perfect world
We can be more than before
I said it was, I made it stronger
[Outro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm
