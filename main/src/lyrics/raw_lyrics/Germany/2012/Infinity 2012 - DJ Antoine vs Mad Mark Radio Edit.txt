And take your time to trust in me
And you will find infinity, infinity
Infinity, infinity (Infinity), infinity (Infinity), infinity

The time goes by so naturally
While you receive
Infinity

[Verse: Daniel Pearce]
Here's my key philosophy
A freak like me just needs infinity
Here's my key philosophy
A freak like me just needs infinity

[Interlude: Daniel Pearce]
(Just needs infinity)
(Just needs infinity)
(Just needs infinity) Relax
(Just needs infinity) Take your time

And take your time to trust in me
And you will find infinity, infinity
And you will find infinity
And you will find infinity
And you will find infinity, infinity
Infinity (Infinity), infinity (Infinity), infinity

[Outro: Daniel Pearce]
The time goes by so naturally
While you receive
Infinity
