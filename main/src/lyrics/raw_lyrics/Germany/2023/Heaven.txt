When I was four, I fell off my bike
But you told me I'd be okay
When I was five, you were by my side
When Mama was far away
And when I was ten, you were my best friend
When no one else came to play
"If anyone hits you, you hit back harder"
That’s what you'd always say

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'd say, "Oh"

[Chorus]
It’s been a long, long day
Are we in Heaven, Heaven, Heaven?
'Cause I don't feel pain
I guess that this is Heaven, Heaven
And if you're far away
We're still together, 'gether, 'gether
And if I never prayed
I guess that we're in Heaven, Heaven

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Oh

As we got older, you never smiled
And I know it’s because of him
Oh, you carried that pain more than any child should
Buried under your skin
Remember that time when I lost my voice
And they said I would never sing?
Well, now you’ve got a kid, I'm with Ed on tour
In cities I’ve never been

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'd say, "Oh"
And you'd say, "Hold my hand, I'll be your brother wherever you go"

[Chorus]
It’s been a long, long day
Are we in Heaven, Heaven, Heaven?
'Cause I don't feel pain
I guess that this is Heaven, Heaven
And if you're far away
We're still together, 'gether, 'gether
And if I never prayed
I guess that we're in Heaven, Heaven

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
Oh
[Bridge]
Now we've grown up and you've built that love
You've got your own family
And maybe one day when I build my own
I'll remember you said to me

[Chorus]
It's been a long, long day
Are we in Heaven, Heaven, Heaven?
'Cause I don't feel pain
I guess that this is Heaven, Heaven
And if you're far away
We're still together, 'gether, 'gether
And if I never prayed
I guess that we're in Heaven, Heaven

[Post-Chorus]
Oh (Heaven)
Oh (Heaven, Heaven, Heaven)
Oh (Heaven)
Oh
