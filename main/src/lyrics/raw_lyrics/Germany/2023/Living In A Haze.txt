I been up a couple days, I wonder why
I been livin' in a haze, what a foolish life
Now I'm back out on the pavement, don't know why
I should be dancin', I should be dancin' the night away

[Chorus]
I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
Movin' like I'm paranoid, paranoid
I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
I should be dancin' the pain away, the pain away

[Verse]
I'm gonna wear my favorite color tonight
Oh my
I'm gonna shake it like the thunder tonight
Oh my
Dreams up in my head
How far can I get?
I hope it's not too late to fly
'Cause I feel like I been goin' under tonight
Oh my

[Pre-Chorus]
I been up a couple days, I wonder why
I been livin' in a haze, what a foolish life
Now I'm back out on the pavement, don't know why
I should be dancin', I should be dancin' the night away
You might also like[Chorus]
I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
Movin' like I'm paranoid, paranoid
I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
I should be dancin' the pain away, the pain away

[Post-Chorus]
I should be dancin'
I should be dancin'

[Bridge]
I'm gonna wear my favorite color tonight
Oh my
I'm gonna shake it like the thunder tonight
Oh my

[Chorus]
I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
Movin' like I'm paranoid, paranoid
I wish I was a disco boy, disco boy
I should be dancin' the pain away, the pain away

[Outro]
(The night away)
I should be dancin' (The night away)
I should be dancin' (The night away)
I should be dancin' the night away1
