Where are the good old days
Caught up in summer haze
When Avicii was our hero?
Just rolling with the waves
Get lost in dirty raves
Now we're going through withdrawal

[Pre-Chorus]
All the songs we played
Spinning 'round my head
I don't them fade
Start 'em all again

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is dancing next to you
Makes me feel like the highest in the room
Time burns fast, but we still got enough
If we got love, yeah, we can light it up
We can light it up
If we got love, yeah, we can light it up
We can light it up
If we got love, yeah, we can light it, we can light it, we can light it up

[Verse 2]
I know that you remember
When everything seemed better
That grass is greener on the other side
Somethings do last forever
Maybe we'll meet Heaven
Do a festival in the afterlife
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All the songs we played
Spinning 'round my head
I don't them fade
Start 'em all again

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is dancing next to you
Makes me feel like the highest in the room
Time burns fast, but we still got enough
If we got love, yeah, we can light it up
We can light it up
If we got love, yeah, we can light it up
We can light it up
If we got love, yeah, we can light it, we can light it, we can light it up

[Bridge]
All the songs we played
Spinning 'round my head

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is dancing next to you
Makes me feel like the highest in the room
Time burns fast, but we still got enough
If we got love, yeah, we can light it up
We can light it up
If we got love, yeah, we can light it up
We can light it up
If we got love, yeah, we can light it, we can light it, we can light it up
[Outro]
(We can light it, we can light it up)
(We can light it, we can light it up)
