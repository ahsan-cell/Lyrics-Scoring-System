I wish that I was someone you need now
Wanna know how you'll be happy again
I'm not someone who always speaks out
Now I see our memories through the rain

[Pre-Chorus: Chris de Sarandy]
Night and day
I still wanna dance in your parade
But you change your lane
I know you now

[Chorus: Chris de Sarandy]
You're lost in your own crowd, it's time to figure out
We sit in silence, I wish you'd say it loud
Are you in or are you out? It's time to tell me now
I can't keep hidin', I just wanna be found

[Drop: Chris de Sarandy]
It's time for you to let me go
Please don't ever let me know
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical

[Verse 2: Chris de Sarandy]
I know that I was someone you needed
Feel defeated by who you became
I'm done with livin' just for the weekend
I don't mean it when I say, "I'm okay"
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Chris de Sarandy]
Night and day
I still wanna dance in your parade
But you change your lane
And I know you now

[Chorus: Chris de Sarandy]
You're lost in your own crowd, it's time to figure out
We sit in silence, I wish you'd say it loud
Are you in or are you out? It's time to tell me now
I can't keep hidin', I just wanna be found

[Drop: Chris de Sarandy]
It's time for you to let me go
Please don't ever let me know
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical
You're cynical
So cynical

[Bridge: Chris de Sarandy]
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical
So cynical
So cynical
[Drop: Chris de Sarandy]
It's time for you to let me go
Please don't ever let me know
It's time for you to let me go
You drag me down, you're cynical
