I see the danger
It's written there in your eyes
You were a stranger
But you've brought me back to life
Now I'm doing things I never do
I'm kinda scared as fuck
But I'm excited too
Yeah, I see the danger
But I want it all the time

[Pre-Chorus]
It's reckless
So selfish
It's all that I need

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna run
I'll run with you
Falling off the edge of the deep blue
My mother always warned me when I was young
But if you're gonna jump, I'm jumping too
If you're getting lost, I want that view
Leave it all bеhind for a lose-lose
My mother always warnеd me when I was young
But if you're gonna jump
If you're gonna jump
I'm jumping too
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna
Jump, jump, jump, I'll jump with you
If you're gonna
Jump, jump, jump, I'll jump with you

[Verse 2]
So give me a parachute
Or throw me off of the edge
I don't really care, girl
As long as you're there at the end
Usually, I'm a rational man
But I've lost control of all that I am
I see the danger
But I want it first hand

[Pre-Chorus]
It's reckless
So selfish
It's all that I need

[Chorus]
So if you're gonna run
I'll run with you
Falling off the edge of the deep blue
My mother always warned me when I was young
If you're gonna jump, I'm jumping too
If you're getting lost, I want that view
Leave it all behind for a lose-lose
My mother always warned me when I was young
If you're gonna jump
If you're gonna jump, I'm jumping too
[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna
Jump, jump, jump, I'll jump with you
If you're gonna
Jump, jump, jump, I'll jump with you

[Breakdown]
If you're gonna run
I'll run with you
Falling off the edge of the deep blue
My mother always warned me when I was young
But if you're gonna jump, I'm jumping too

[Chorus]
If you're getting lost, I want that view
Leave it all behind for a lose-lose
My mother always warned me when I was young
If you're gonna jump
If you're gonna jump
I'm jumping too

[Post-Chorus]
If you're gonna
Jump, jump, jump, I'll jump with you
If you're gonna
Jump, jump, jump, I'll jump with you
(You, you, you)
