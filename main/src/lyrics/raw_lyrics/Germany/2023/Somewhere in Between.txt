(Somewhere in between, somewhere in between)

[Verse 1]
Put me inside a box
Breathin' heavy 'cause it's not big enough
Everybody just talks
Stop wastin' time 'cause I'm takin' off my cuffs

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay the same but change, why is ist not makin' sense?
Confusion in my head, I didn't know who I am
The one who always felt like she is walkin' on broken glass
I stay the same, won't change, I'm sick of playin' these games
Got clarity inside of me, I know who I am
No matter what you saw, I know my heart always stayed the same

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wanna let go, let go
Start over from the get-go, get-go
The role I've played, I've outgrown, outgrown
I'm somewhere in between, somewhere in between
Sometimes, I wanna let go, let go
Start over from the get-go, get-go
Don't care as long as I know, I know
I'm somewhere in between, somewhere in between

Gotta believe me, I've tried (Gotta believe me, I've tried)
I'm good at puttin' my feelings to the side
Got my eyes open wide (Got my eyes open wide)
A million colors and not just black and white

[Pre-Chorus]
Stay the same but change, why is ist not makin' sense?
Confusion in my head, I didn't know who I am
The one who always felt like she is walkin' on broken glass
I stay the same, won't change, I'm sick of playin' these games
Got clarity inside of me, I know who I am
No matter what you saw, I know my heart always stayed the same

[Chorus]
Sometimes, I wanna let go, let go
Start over from the get-go, get-go
The role I've played, I've outgrown, outgrown
I'm somewhere in between, somewhere in between (Ahh)
Sometimes, I wanna let go, let go
Start over from the get-go, get-go
Don't care as long as I know, I know
I'm somewhere in between, somewhere in between

[Outro]
Sometimes, I wanna let go, let go
Start over from the get-go, get-go
Don't care as long as I know, I know
I'm somewhere in between, somewhere in between
