God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you (Mm)

[Verse 1: FAST BOY]
I'm drivin' down the coast of Delaware
I had to leave before I fall off the tightrope
Run for my life 'cause, babe, I'm well aware
Need to get out of here right now

[Pre-Chorus: FAST BOY]
Outta my head
Yes, I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin', I'm beggin' you
I'm drivin' so fast
But my heart won't move
Whatever, whatever I do

[Chorus: FAST BOY]
God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
And from the start, I shoulda known you're bad news
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
And from the start, I shoulda known you're bad news
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you

I'd pay a fortune for amnesia (Amnesia)
And here I'm tryin' not to jump off the deep end
In every face, I see a piece of ya
And, yeah, I dream of my freedom

[Pre-Chorus: FAST BOY]
Outta my head
Yes, I'm beggin' you
I'm beggin', I'm beggin' you
I'm drivin' so fast
But my heart won't move
Whatever, whatever I do

[Chorus: FAST BOY]
God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you (Oh)
And from the start, I shoulda known you're bad news (Forgettin' to forget you)
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you

[Post-Chorus: FAST BOY]
(God, I)
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
(God, I)
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
[Outro: FAST BOY]
God, I wish I never met you
I, I keep forgettin' to forget you
Forget you
