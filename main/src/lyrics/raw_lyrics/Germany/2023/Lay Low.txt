Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time

[Verse]
I'm hearin' voices in my head
There's no way to escape
Da-da-da-da, they got me
Anytime, anywhere
In my mind, in the air
Da-da-da-da, surround me

[Refrain]
(Lay low) They surround me
(Lay low) Surround me
Anytime, anywhere
In my mind, in the air
They're waiting for me
Oh, they're callin' on me

[Chorus]
Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time (Surround me)
Yеah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and, baby, I feel high
I feel high (Thеy're callin' on me)
Lay low, hit the sun
Everybody have a real good time
Real good time (Surround me)
Yeah, we cool, yeah, we drunk
Lost my mind and, baby, I feel high
I feel high (They're callin' on me)
