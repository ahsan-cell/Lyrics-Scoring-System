Well, the sky broke in two
I found you dancing alone
And the room filled up with you
And a song we both know

[Verse 2]
That's when you caught me with your eyes
Sending shivers down my spine
And then you whispered in my ear
You said "I can feel it too"
And then you pulled me into you

[Chorus]
Tonight, I got you where I want you
Closer I can tell you anything
You're the song that I sing
Tonight, let the music take us over
We'll fall into forever, all is right
'Cause I've got where I want you, tonight

[Verse 3]
Through all of science and history
Well, nothing's ever stuck with me
But now I'm locked onto you
And holding onto
The only thing I know
And now I never let it go
You might also like[Chrous]
Tonight, I got you where I want you
Closer I can tell you anything
You're the song that I sing
Tonight, let the music take us over
We'll fall into forever, all is right
'Cause I've got where I want you

[Bridge]
Tonight (tonight), tonight (tonight)
The whole world could fall away
But you and I
No, we won't be afraid
Tonight (tonight)
I got where I want to
Closer I can tell you anything

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Tonight, let the music take us over
We'll fall into forever, all is right
'Cause I've got where I want you, tonight
I got where I want you, tonight

[Outro]
I got where I want you, tonight1
