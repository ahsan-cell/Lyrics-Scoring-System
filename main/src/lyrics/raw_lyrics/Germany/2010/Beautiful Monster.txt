All my life
And the hereafter
I've never seen
Seen one like you
You're a knife
Sharp and deadly
And it's me
That you cut into
But I don't mind
In fact I like it
Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you

[Chorus]
She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
And I need her
Said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind

[Bridge]
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)
No, I don't mind
(I don't mind, I don't, I don't mind...)

She's burning through
But I don't mind

Though I'm terrified
I'm turned on but scared of you

She's a monster
Beautiful monster
Beautiful monster

Said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind

[Bridge 2]
No I don't mind
Playing with my heart
And she's playing with my mind
And I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
No I don't mind I don't I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) And I don't mind
(I don't mind I don't I don't mind) Said I don't mind

And I need her
Said I need her
Beautiful monster
But I don't mind
