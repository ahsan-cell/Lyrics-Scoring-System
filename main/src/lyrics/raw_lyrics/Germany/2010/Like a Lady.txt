Just when I hear your name
Even the thought of you
Should get me in a crazy mood

The thought of you and me
Doesn't leave my memory
I think that you should know
How to get me in your flow

Make it to real love
Start it up and show that you could
And if you go and take it to the limit now
You show that you're doing good (good, goood)

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if I fall save me
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should (girl should, girl should)

Don't wanna mess around
Waiting till you find out
That I'm the one for you
Fitting in your dancing shoes
You might also likeI need your feedback now
Just we are meant somehow
Don't wait for centuries
Show her you've got up this lead

Making a showstopper, high clocker
Show that you could
And if you gonna take it to the limit now
Be sure that you're doing good, so good, so good...

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
Love me like crazy
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should

Treat me like a, ah, ah, a lady
And I love you like a girl should (I love you like a girl should)
Treat me like a, ah, ah, a lady
And I love you like a girl should!

And if you finally make it
I know we both
Could feel like first-in-lovers
Like boy and girl should
I just can't wait for treating you good
And giving you the right love
Just like a girl should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
Love me like crazy
Like a boy should
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should

Treat me like a, ah, ah, a lady (like a girl should)
And I love you like a girl should (I love you like a girl should)
Treat me like a, ah, ah, a lady (like a girl should)
And I love you like a girl should!

Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should (love you like a, like a boy should)
Love me like crazy
Like a boy should (love you like a girl should)
Treat me like a lady
Like a boy should (love you like a girl should)
And if you amaze me
I know that I could
Love you like a girl should
