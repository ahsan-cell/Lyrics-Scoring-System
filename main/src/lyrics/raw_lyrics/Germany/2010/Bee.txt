'Cause I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys
All looking at me
And the world keeps the buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going \"hm hm hm\"
And this is only the start
Ah-haha hm-hm la-la-lai

[Verse 1]
Did you ever want something so bad
You could feel it to the end of the fingertips
They're reaching out for something to grab
Then someone smacks your hand

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And they've it becomes so hard eh to see
T-The end of the line

[Chorus]
But I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys
All looking at me
And the world keeps the buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going \"hm hm hm\"
And this is only the start
Ah-ah, ah-ah-um, ah-ah-um

I feel like a little kid again
No worries for me to understand
Falling in love each night and then
Waking up with the feeling that I can't

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Describe... I love this life
It just gets better

[Chorus]
But I'm free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys
All looking at me
Let the world keeps the buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going \"hm hm hm\"
And this is only the start
Ah-ah-um, ah-ah-um, ah-ah-um

Free as a bee flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys
All looking at me
And my world keeps the buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going \"hm hm hm\"
And this is only the start
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm free as a bee and flying over the trees
All the summertime boys
All looking at me
And the world keeps the buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going \"hm hm hm\"
And this is only the start
Ah-ah, ah-ah-um, ah-ah-um

'Cause I'm free as a bee and flying over the trees
And all the summertime boys

And my world keeps the buzzing to the sound of my heart
Going \"hm hm hm\"
And this is only the start
Ah-ah-um, ah-ah-um, ah-ah-um
