This is a song for a girl called Sophie
Used to write her name on my arm
Time has made us strangers
And I don't know her anymore
But I really hope she's made it
That someone took her home
She was lost but wasn't missing
She would always walk alone

[Chorus]
She was always like a feather, in the air
I never knew if she was flying or falling
She was always like a feather, in my life
I hope she flies
I hope she flies
I hope she flies
I hope she flies

[Verse 2]
Because of her, I looks things that last:
I have a chain, where's your arm?
A promise can be broken
I won't hunt you anymore
No, no, no
But I really hope she's made it
That someone took her home
She was lost but wasn't missing
She would always walk alone

She. La-la-la-la-la-la-la
She. La-la-la-la-la-la-la
She. La-la-la-la-la-la-la
She. La-la-la-la-la-la-la
I hope she flies

[Chorus]

[Outro]
She. La-la-la-la-la-la-la
