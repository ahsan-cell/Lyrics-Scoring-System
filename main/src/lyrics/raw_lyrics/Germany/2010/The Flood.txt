Standing on the edge of forever
At the start of whatever
Shouting love at the world
Back then we were like cavemen
But we map the moon and the stars
Then we forgave them

[Pre-Chorus 1 - Robbie]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

[Gary]
You know no one dies
In these love drowned eyes
Through our love drowned eyes
We’ll watch you sleep tonight

[Chorus 1]
Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again

Bleeding, but none of us leaving
Watch your mouth son
Or you’ll find yourself floating home

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Here we come now on a dark star
Seeing demons, not what we are
Tiny minds and eager hands will try to strike but now will end today

There’s progress now
Where there once was none
Where there once was none
Then everything came along

[Chorus 2]
Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood
They said we’d never dance again
[Pre-Chorus 1]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

[Chorus 3]
Although no one understood
There was more of them than us
Learning how to dance the rain
(Learning how to dance the rain)
There was more of them than us
Now they’ll never dance again
Now we’ll never dance again
