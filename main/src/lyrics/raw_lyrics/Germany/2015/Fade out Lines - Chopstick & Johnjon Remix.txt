Fromage l'as Vegas to Richter h√®re
Under your dresser
Right by you ear
It s creeping In sweetly
It s definitely here
There s nothing more deadly
Than slow growing fear

Life was full and fruitful
And you could a take a real bite
The juive Well over
You skins delight
But the shadow it grows
And take the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces
To this pricipless ballet

The shallower it grows
The fainter we go

Did we build all those bridges
To watch them voluntarily
Of constant trust
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won't be a party with weathering frocksSee The Avener LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like
