I want him to meet his maker
I used to be a lover, now I'm a hater
My passion to succeed is watching him bleed
Oh Lord, what have become of me?

[Chorus]
Once upon a time, I was a fool
Too cool for school, gangster cruel
Blood in, blood out, pull the trigger, no doubt
Lucky motherfucker, you don't know what I'd do to you
I used to kick it with Lucifer
And he still lingers in the dark, oh
Oh, Lucifer
You better watch out

[Verse 2]
The evil within has never been greater
My soul has been seized and he's the dictator
I've been dragged through the mud, I can still taste the blood
Oh Lord, what have become of me?

[Chorus]
Once upon a time, I was a fool
Too cool for school, gangster cruel
Blood in, blood out, pull the trigger, no doubt
Lucky motherfucker, you don't know what I'd do to you
I used to kick it with Lucifer
And he still lingers in the dark, oh
Oh, Lucifer
You better watch out
You might also like[Bridge]
Sometimes I feel like seeking him down just for the hell of it
Look for his face around town, smack, smack, just a bit
Lucky motherfucker got away with my cash
I built you up and I'ma tear you down, down just like that

[Chorus]
Once upon a time, I was a fool
Too cool for school, gangster cruel
Blood in, blood out, pull the trigger, no doubt
Lucky motherfucker, you don't know what I'd do to you
I used to kick it with Lucifer
And he still lingers in the dark, oh
Oh, Lucifer
You better watch out

[Outro]
The devil's been an angel
Even the Devil's been an angel
Lucifer
D-Devil's been an angel
D-Devil's been an angel
Even the Devil's been an angel
