Chillin' with a hair tie, no makeup, with some sweatpants on
You know I can always be that guy
You can think about be me all night long
But I think you need something to think of me
Something that will keep you warm
And show we can be more than just this
So, baby, if you are not ready for my kiss

[Chorus]
Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together 'til the end
Girl, you can wear my sweatshirt
'Cause you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So, baby, wear mine

[Verse 2]
When you go to sleep at night, when you wake up in the morning
And when you walk the halls, girl, you know wanna flaunt it
Said this may be the start of something new
Girl, I'm gonna tell you exactly what I wanna do is more than just this
So, baby, if you are not ready for my kiss

[Chorus]
Then you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together 'til the end
Girl, you can wear my sweatshirt
'Cause you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So, baby, wear mine and you can wear my sweatshirt
And I don't want you to be cold
So you can wear my sweatshirt
And you can tell your friends we'll be together 'til the end
Girl, you can wear my sweatshirt
'Cause you're the only one I hold and I don't want you to be cold
So, baby, wear mineYou might also like20
