Before we get to choppin' this fable, I got an axe to grind
Say what you want about our very first battle, the rematch was mine
But tonight, my raps designed with a chiropractic mind, time to crack his spine
You know, put a nigga back in line
Talk stupid? Give his ass a .9
I was aimin' for his stomach but he ducked quick, had his abs in mind
And left him with an absent mind
The most satisfying thing about this battle? It only proves I'm hot
But since I got robbed now you gettin' robbed, don't make me shoot the shot
Fuck the opinions, Rum Nitty, Ill Will, and Lexx Luthor got
I'm sippin' rum with ill will, hop out the Lex just to loot the spot
Ruger pop, and that's how you make 'em chill
With a kick back
I got the Juice, like OJ, wait, shit let me flip that
I'm OJ, how I murdered this white bitch he should've quit that
Nah I'm OJ cause I came out west to get my shit back
Big facts
After the match? Shit, we walked from the club
People seen how we was drunk, yeah we got caught wit' a buzz
So of course they came over, started talked to us
Do y'all have any idea how awkward it was?
They was like, "Wow. What a battle
Chilla your first? Was unbelievable, and yoursecond...Real Deal, I thought a win was unachievable
I had it 2-0 goin' into the thirrd I...I thought the judges must've seen it too
But then ya third...was so heartfelt. Nothing but love from me to you
See, I'm one of your biggest fans. You always bring it in the ring bro
I mean I had Chilla 2-1 but still...you did your thing though."
And that's the thing bro
You'll say it's hate if I say it's a straight robbery
Now, I ain't lettin' that chain part from me
A K to this chest, why let a man jack it (letterman jacket) I play varsity
Now his Beans gettin' shot through the back like State Property
Go 'head, make mockeries of my passion and purpose
But I will leave you in grave (engrave) and I'm just scratchin' the surface
How 'bout a bullet in ya eye Deal (ideal), that would be perfect
All day these fans will praise you but are you actually worth it?
I mean when I'm rappin' these verses, you can tell that I'm one of the best
But this match was your fuckin' request, it's you who needs your fuckin' respect
We even agreed to split the cash, 'til I split the bag and shook until nothin' was left
He's lookin' at me like, "Where's my cut?"
I said, "Oh yeah...under ya neck!"
I'm [?], I slit his throat, shit was gross, drippin' slow, he turnin' purple
{Gasps} This ain't how we expected his end to go (indigo)
Listen bro
Everybody knows that you a battle vet'
So when they boo'd you I said, "No. No. Get your act correct
Don't do that to my mans, B. Have respect."
Gordon Ramsey I could've brought the whole Mass to (Master) Chef
Blastin' TEC's, you would've been runnin' from a barrage when them clips bustin'
Tips touch him like a massage it was ME who was the winner, this motherfuckas a fraud
The judges thought it was Real but it wasn't like a mirage
On dawgs we could've did this alone
No cameramen, flow damagin', disappear, then bro vanishin'
I slacked versus DNA last month but no panicking
I was savin' myself for the title, it's load management
You might've battled dudes who sound like me
But you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these
Boss Town!

Have you seen my Mackk Myron battle?
You think I think losings a problem?
You talk about the way the crowd treated me
But I fucked your bitch in your city in your house, so it wasn't the first time I was boo'd up in Boston
Y'all ready for these "Jones" flips?
"Jones" that, "Jones" this
All this time have plates, y'all ready for personals
Me to bring up his demons, since I know the guy's past, great
Y'all ready for gun bars?
Chilla flips?
Add 'em all up, now how many lines do I have? Wait
You add the three columns, carry the two- zero
There's a difference between motherfuckers that teach elementary and motherfuckers that write that way
I guess Boston just hates me
Probably...maybe
You had fans online like, "You robbed him. King Of The Dot is fugazi
Chilla was fucking scheming"
But you know in your heart of hearts Jones you've lost and what's crazy
Despite the cryin' at the crib, that's somethin' you can't shake like a colicky baby
Let's do some real schemin', we got history dawg (dog)
Wishbone, I watched our battle from the rounds to the intros
Studied, I can beat you in any facet
We can freestyle, no pads, turn this shit show rugby
They wonder how I'm a chef but I show up every battle, rip show, hungry
The drive different, a Mustang to a Pinto buggy
I'm livin' the American Dream
Walkin' them roads (Rhodes) is why my kicks so Dusty
Pursuit of Happyness find Will with the Kid, no Cudi
A teacher and a class act, I'm tryin' to figure out the Cali swag but won't hit no 'Dougie'
A white trash rapper, that's what put me on the map, but in big smoke country
I'm skitzo nutty
I'll chug a bottle of Vladimir in this battle here and that Klitschko buddy
Who the coldest? Y'all be listin' rappers
I'll Ali/Liston rappers
So as for as the Fore cast for this goes; sunny (Sonny)
Your homies thinkin' they can be G's (BeeGees) like disco
Cause a Spike in crime when y'all Gizmo cuddly
But I get it, Family Matters; Winslow
Ya clique talk pit; bitchmode
Big fish know; minnow/guppy
You soft as shit bro
Do I think he'll let a clip go? That's a big "no" from me
Lead pop, headshot, I'd rather hear a Ted Talk from a Skid Row junkie
Quick question: why ya chick so smutty?
Big boned/chubby
5'3", 210, tryin' to pass as a thick Snow Bunny
Nah I'm playin', you could've been a King Tut mummy in a tomb and not whip no honey
We don't sip no bubbly
We want that "show up to business meetings in gym clothes" money
You better tip toe, before these mitts go
And ya daughter like, "Daddy why ya lips so Puffy?"
"That's cause I thought I told you that we won't stop."
Slice like Kimbo, use a knife edge like Ric Flair, big show Dudley
You down 0-1
Shit, right now it's lookin' '01 Bubba Sparxxx with Timbo 'Ugly'
Ask the judges
Bet after this round all 5 say "1-0"
Where we at? 5-1-0
Everyone in the area and zip code loves me
I'm that good
I'll put hands on this bitch
Fuck that, feet too and Riverdance on his shit
Thought I was in for a challenge 'til he layin' mannequin stiff
I snap like an Anderson kick
Fuck goin' hand to hand with this bitch
It's Anchorman y'all gon' see Burgundy on screen and a Champ with a Brick
I said, Real Deal vs Chilla 3?
They said you got dope shit, "We on board" so basically y'all drug mules
I whipped ya ass last time
And you looked puzzled as fuck fool
Aye Oakland, I guess this New England dude forgot about the tuck rule
[Round 2: Chilla Jones]
So tell me if I'm wrong, cause I ain't here to be mixin' your words
You said Gully wastes money havin' me host and he should be a bit more concerned

[Real Deal]
I didn't say that

[Chilla Jones]
You said I throw GZ's in Boston and don't pay battlers a cent that they earned
Then you offered to fly me out to host your GZ event in the 'Burgh
Okay, word?!
So you discredited my work with the league then followed in my footsteps knowin' you learned it from me
The contradiction, I can't help what any person believes
I guess that was a cute (accute) angle to a certain degree
But see then, you attacked my pen, honestly the shit is a scam
Cause you like to spend ya time breakin' down rhymes thinkin' it'll be a kick to the fans
You did it versus me in both battles
Pllus versus Magic and Soul, now keep listenin' fam'
You did it versus Ward, O, Math, Sketch, Sno, man this shit is a scam
It's the same angle every time we see you like insecure chicks on the 'Gram
A magnificient plan
Cause y'all will say the Chef is cookin' me with heat, but it's gas
And the steez ya on (anesthesia), just puttin' me to sleep
It's cheap, the perfect defense, bar for bar you're just decent
The ones who criticize the most, never say shit worth critiquing
It be weak when bro yellin'
The judges? Yeah they the generous type
But this a battle I ain't takin' no L in, it's all fake
Y'all think he's snitchin' on Jones tellin'
But Real'll state lies since (real estate license), y'all buyin' what holmes (homes) sellin'
And for closure (foreclosure), I brought a big (Bigg) K if you try and Flex
Bam, Emeril Lagasse, that's the sound of the Iron, Chef
Yeah I'ma vet', and you're a vet', so fair to say we have vet' ties
But they've been sugarcoating lately, that ain't somethin' I'ma let fly
Keep it real with Real about our battle people, less lies
R.I.P. Isaac Hayes, cause Chef dies!
Forget pride, tell 'em the truth, let ya homie know
Or you ain't Real boy, you just a puppet like Pinocchio
I go for broke, so fuck how this guy might feel
I guess I gotta highlight Real for the highlight reel
Who rhyme like Chill?
#1 where the bars ranked
I'm puttin' on a show for Deal
I'm Mark Cuban in the Shark Tank
Sharp shank, scratch that, the steel'll fire
Chill a rider like a soup kitchen how I'm servin' these bums
Plus I'm a meal (mil') provider
Everybody tried to save money and I feel for buyers
But this a limited time offer
Now I'm makin' sure Deal expires
I fire, and sit him down then wait on him like a maitre d
Soon as he get up I knot (not) Real like it's make believe
Remember what you say to me Deal cause I'm here now
And if we square up, guarantee it's a square down
Watch ya step, cause you the type to take flight over a stare (stair) down
Sorry to burst ya bubble but you ain't winnin' a clear round
Yeah clown, fuck the arguin', you and ya homie hatin'
I ain't goin' back and forth with Deal, we ain't negotiatin'
Jones is patient
But this ain't workin' out, I'm over weightin'
Get spotted, then marked (Denmark) for the capital (capitol); Copenhagen
I hope you takin' fresh angles in this battle
I mean we wanna see somethin' revealed
Cause despite ya name in ya last battle homie, nothin' was Real
And that's why 'You Can't Touch This' cause my tool legit ('2 Legit')
Plus I be tuckin' the steel
And we in Oakland, y'all 'bout to see another MC Hammer fuck up a Deal!
And Da Don is in the buildin'
Matter of fact let me get closer so you can hear this well
You should go and get a hoodie from Hollow or I'll put a hollow in ya hoodie
Either way you gonna wear this L
See it's different
You might've battled dudes who sound like me
But you ain't never stood in front of three rounds like these
Boss Town!
[Round 2: Real Deal]
Are y'all his dawgs?
Okay, cause he just had like a Pinocchio boy line, you have been fallin' off
But aye, you're the King Pen
Ha, I'm from that age of freestylin'
That era was tougher
Where you would just make random comparissons like, "You look like-" and there was the structure
That bein' said, you and DJ Akademiks could be the Spiderman meme where they point and stare at each other
Cause I swear y'all are brothers
That shit looks like Hootie & The Blowfish's Darius Rucker had affaris with your mothers
You said in Pittsburgh, you would walk through the projects like a teacher at a science fair
That was hard as shit but bro that wouldn't be smart Chilla Jones
A stop for car issues could get you scar tissue
Lose your wallet, card and ya phone
They circle back like a shark bit you
You got bark in you, but you don't have the heart witchu
He got a warrior mentality, 'til we catch him in the PJ's and he get [?]
See I'm extra with it Chilla, let me catch you on your strip
LA riots, here's the verdict, King
There ain't a first responder team that can rescue you from this
You better keep on truckin' unless you wanna end up like Reginald Denny by a semi with the shit
The docs like, "He ain't out the woods yet."
That's fittin' cause he gon' have his teeth missin' like a West Virginia hick
Fuck Chilla's schemes got killed in three for Lexx, Nitty and Will to see
Moneyball he got taken apart, no cap, now we tryin' to rebuild a dream like Billy Beane
I'll rock his shit like he a Philistine
He see more stars than the silver screen
They askin', "Who's the killer?" like the build in Scream
But I am responsible for his trilogy so who really, who's trilla G?
Why don't you ask your homie Method Man?
When this battle got announced, he got to bloggin', right?
I'm thinkin', "Cool. A legend. My man Method", thought it brought some hype
But then he was like, "Chilla won, 2-1. Judges was racist", rah rah
Nah, I'm like, "Wish y'all would've let me respond."
You would've seen a teacher cook Meth' in a trailer like Walter White to Drop The Mic
Then, Mickey Factz went on Champion...and went on the champion
Threw some jabs, an opinion from Mickey? Worthless
Shit Mickey Worthless would 30 him on Unilad
He barely battles, just dabbles, DNA whipped his ass and dude was mad
I see when it comes to this, Mick' lovin' (McLovin) to play a role until someone do him Superbad
See, I got in the way of King Of The Dot and their true vision
Chain? They ain't want no bearded white kid from Pittsburgh to rock this
Are you kiddin'?
Chef, yeah, for the squatters in food kitchens
Blue color I move different
I've been having to fight as hard as Magic Johnson's immune system
But I said, "The champ is clean", they tryin' to kill an Irishman; Danny Greene
I'm ready for shit to kick off but I need a draft first like an expansion team
Follow me Mr. Tambourine
They see the moves and flock
Keep tabs on me like Dewey Cox on a trampoline
They said, "Take a chill pill" I'm just too fly I'm afraid; Dramamine
Chilla's a nice guy, that's my word, honest truth
So when I beat you, fans that loved us both turned on me too
Cause you're such a nice guy, you're awesome dude
But every face needs a good heel that's why I'm curb stompin' you
But hey, you are my guy, even if we don't see eye to eye on somethin' buddy
Like that eyeball scheme you did in Boston
Was that an optical illusion? Maybe it'll be more clear next year in 2020 (20/20)
Bro I talked to you like a thousand times over eight years, that's somethin' I'm proud to say
And you have said the word "risk" like a hundred times and he always pronounce his "k"
"Risk" about the chain, this angle I'm about to take
Parker Brothers Risk he even talked about the game
But you get him in a scheme about eyes and the "k" is gone without a trace
"Iris" to "I risk", that writing is clever
You're a real King Pen, fuck silencing witnesses you can silence a letter
But aye, as he said, "What's even cornier (cornea)" eh? Eh? Eh?
Wakka wakka
You said my students were supposed to die at a certain time but "now my pupils will die late (dilate)"
I'm lost bro
So they had a scheduled time like, "Ah, I gotta pass away but oh my God, due to time-" I don't know, I tried dawg, hopeless
But the fans erupted, so maybe it's my fault
Oh I get it, "eyebrows", "pupil", "dilate" "cor-" all has something to do with the eyeball, don't it
No wonder you're such a fixture, you rap to give idiots light bulb moments

[Round 3: Chilla Jones]
You said "every face deserves a good heel" that's why you won't be better as champ
But go 'head, hurt yourself turnin' heel (heal) in The Bay like Kevin Durant
And then you talked about my eyeball scheme, for that I should spark and blast ya
The pistol whip and have ya eye on ya shit like Sparka glasses
For me to get my title shot, I had to go through Solomon, it was GOAT shit
For you to own ya title shot you had to go through Sketch Menace and PoRich
Oh shit, shit what if I win?
You know my next opponent gonna be Nitty
They said I can't bring the chain to URL, if I do they won't be pretty
But didn't Real Deal go to England and bring the chain to Premier? Didn't ICE go to RBE when he hadn't stepped on this stage for a year?
Now I see why Daylyt dressed up slave, he was trying to explain to his peers
It can change your career, but in a bad way and he was just makin' it clear
But how can anybody here think I'm tryin' to be disloyal at the chains expense?
I mean what are the real perks to bein' champ?
Honestly, don't take offense
I mean besides the extra $1,000, what is it?
Being the main event?
Then shouldn't we be headlining Day 2? Do y'all see why this ain't makin' sense?
You don't get to pick your opponents, you don't get paid the most
You don't get to battle on other leagues, only on events that they promote
See Pat left cause he needed that freedom, it's the only way you can chase the GOATs
And it's all those fuckin' restrictions why y'all beloved chain became a joke
Until I stepped in with a vision
Brought relevance to the chain, laid the blueprint for new champs
Set precedence in this game
Became staff, booked battles, shit my online presence was just insane
So win or lose, after me, this shit'll never will be the same
Let me explain
I got Deal throwin' GZ's in Pittsburgh
And I ain't just sayin' that for y'all, those is his words
And all I'm tryin' to do now is continue to bridge the gap
So that people like Diz' and Pat have an interest to get it back!
It's a fact, you got the chain and became mellow like you don't care
I got the chain and became 'Melo a Trailblazer outta nowhere
Oh yeah
I'm a genius, this type of foresight you can't find
Man, I've been blowin' up off of the underground, Trevor this land mines (landmine)
If you don't think the Anchor, Man you out ya damn mind
Ironic you talk sports and you ain't even the Champ Kind
I got the stamp, that's how I address males (mails), I'm the GOAT
Goin' postal with this delivery, Jones pushin' the envelope
My bro, this is not a joke
My bro is a legend full of sorrow
He's an alcoholic, you can smell it on his breath until tomorrow
But I'm a good friend, I try to cheer him up and I never let him wallow
But today? I'll crack his dome Corona cause there's a message in the bottle
Now do you follow?
I mean it's beyond just havin' some fun
He got jealous when he heard I heard I had a battle with Rum
But no more hi-fives, try to handle these war games
If I leave the Chef hangin', think Anthony Bourdain
But we relate to your pain, that you felt you need to share
About everything you dealt with staring helplessly in fear
As your dad was goin' through it, he was depressed and he was scared
Then wrote three rounds and didn't even expect to be prepared
But my mother raised me by herself and it was stressin' me to tears
I was neglected by my pops, it's like he never even cared
So when I see you goin' through it, none of my empathy's sincere
But I just can't relate, my father's been dead to me for years!
You respected by your peers?
I elected to be feared
I progressed through every tier, you excepted your career
See it's clear
We don't compare cause you corny and lame
And for ten years I don't think your story has changed
So award me the chain or this .40 will bang
And leave his front row empty like a Warriors game
Y'all know my motherfuckin' name!
Stop givin' him props, the new two time champ, the King Pen Of The Dot!

[Round 3: Real Deal]
First battle we had, he said I was a racist
I said, "It's just a battle, he's just tryin' to cook me."
Next battle we had, you said I was a racist, now that shit just kinda took me
Cause we're homies, like actual friends
So even if you implied I could be
What's that make you for bein' friends with a racist?
In a city where the Panthers started this cat's a different kind of pussy
Can you imagine how Bobby Seal would probably feel?
You like, "I mean...nah, he's not a heel
He's an admitted culture vulture but if you can tolerate his neo-Nazi spiels and how mad he was when Colin kneeled
His hot takes kinda got appeal. It's actually cool to talk to Deal."
Stop the lyin', lazy angles, y'all too blind to see
Calls himself "King Pen" then pulls a jester move, dawg the irony
When they said, "Break a leg" they don't mean "use a crutch", you've walked that line with me
Tryin' to take a cop out, then get away with it like 'Pac in '93
So all the sudden I'm a fuckin' Nazi for the heehaw of the crowd?
But you know where I teach, what I've done for the commun- never mind, fuck is we talkin' about?
You supposed to be my hom- see, it's not that deep, I'm off of it now
Matter of fact, here's the five you keep askin' for, peace offering blaow!
Cause you're a phony, a snake, I'm mad that you played me
That is your Achilles heel
Which takes away from the raps like a KD
King Of The Dot gave you a second wind, you turned your back on the same league
You're a motherfuckin' Judas which makes sense cause you got your first bag off of JC
I said history lesson, we meet Chilla in 2012
First fan comment, "Pen is fire. But you gotta get more animated, like perform all out."
Chilla read that shit like, "Animated. So do a cartoon scheme and make it more drawn out."
2013, they're like, "Nah your pen is straight, but in the end if you can't be more intense they stay skeptical."
Chilla read that shit like, "In the end (Indian) intense (in tents). So more single meanings and make it the same decibel?"
2014 he's readin' comments and he flies off for nothin'
The fans like, "Bro. Your pen is good! You just need energy/projection."
Chilla read that shit like, "Energy/projection. You mean like Cyclops or somethin'?"
2015 they like, "Dawg this is gettin' old. Yell or something. You probably should"
Chilla read that shit like, "Old yell or (Yeller) so I should rap about a dog getting shot in the woods?"
By 2016 fans wrote you off as boring
Organik pulled you to the side like, "Make a choice
I booked you Gjonaj, he yells a lot. You're going to fucking lose if you don't raise your voice!"
And look what happened, whoo!
We were so proud, everyone in battle rap stood up to applaud you
King Of The Dot not only put you on as champion, he also gave you a strong suit
You was out here barkin' on people, sayin' it with your chest, you boss you!
UK did an event called Speak Up to raise awareness and they fuckin' called you!
But now that he got a bit more range here comes the broad move
King Of The Dot gave you bands and helped you gain steam
URL gave you Steams on Banned in a small room
Despite the stipulations you signed up for a bout havin' this chain
Your next battle's on URL versus Nitty, the unmitigated gall dude
Organik, ain't that a Smack in your face, his next battle's on Volume
So yeah, I've been in front of plenty of dudes who sound like holmes
But I ain't never lost respect for someone being a clown like Jones
