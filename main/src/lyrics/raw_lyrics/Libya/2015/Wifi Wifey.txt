Do you double tap like me?
When I'm on the road you can Skype me
I'll follow if you follow me back
You my wifi wifey
I know your parents don't like me
And your ex wanna fight me
You can hit me up on Snapchat
You my wifi wifey

[Verse 1]
Wassup, lil' mama, what's good?
Follow me back, yeah I really wish you would
Nick Bean comin' straight to your neighborhood
And you know I stay fly like a player really should
Oh no
Girl, if you snap me I'ma snap back
And I stay up on your mind like a snapback
Anything you want, you can have that
Body on fleek
Girl you know that I love that

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm saving money like Geico
Babygirl got me dancing like Micheal
Pockets getting fat
Yeah they need lipo
Really tryna duck
Oh no girl, typo

[Verse 2]
Girl keep it on the low
Don't nobody gotta know
You can hit me on twitter
Or hit me on my phone
I see you got your nails done
I see you got your hair did
I wanna grow old with ya
And have some grandkids

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm saving money like Geico
Babygirl got me dancing like Micheal
Pockets getting fat

Really tryna duck
Oh no girl, typo
