"Victorious" by Wolfmother

[Verse: Wolfmother]
It seems that I just thought they could take their sweet time
Sippin' cocktails in the sun, enjoying the sunshine
She can't wait to unleash, unleash all her rage
With an electric guitar and blow them off the stage

[Chorus: Wolfmother]
She will be victorious
And won't get the battle loss
Always-a mysterious
Cause she will be victorious

[Outro: Wolfmother]
Cause she will be victorious

"Raindrops (an angel cried)" by Ariana Grande

[Verse: Ariana Grande]
When raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried
An angel cried, she cried
"7 rings" by Ariana Grande

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Yeah, breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things (Yeah)
Been through some bad [...], I should be a sad [...]
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings
Write my own checks like I write what I sing, yeah (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
My wrist, stop watchin', my neck is flossy
Make big deposits, my gloss is poppin'
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yeah)

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
I want it, I got it, I want it, I got it
You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it (Yep)

"Be Alright" by Ariana Grande

[Verse: Ariana Grande]
Midnight shadows
When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're gonna be alright (Hey)
We're gonna be alright (Oh yeah, oh yeah)
We're gonna be alright

[Refrain: Ariana Grande]
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
We're gonna be alright (Hey-hey)
We're gonna be alright (Yeah, oh yeah, hey)
We're gonna be alright

"R.E.M." by Ariana Grande

[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep ('Sleep)
You're such a dream to me

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
(No I don't want, no)
'Cause you're such a dream (Does this end?)
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me

What we gotta do right here is go back
Back into time
I love the way you make me feel (Okay)
I love it, I love it (Yeah)
I love the way you make me feel
I love it (Yeah), I love it (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Ariana Grande]
Say
I'm thinkin' 'bout her every second, every hour
Do my singin' in the shower, pickin' petals off of flowers like
Do she love me, do she love me not? (Love me not)
I ain't a player, I just—
You give me that kinda somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten, I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can't stay away

[Refrain 1: Ariana Grande]
If you want what I got, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I'll never leave ya
And I ain't going nowhere 'cause you're a keeper

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande & Mac Miller]
So don't you worry
Baby, you got me (Ayy)
I, I got a bad boy, I must admit it (Hey)
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it (Hey)
And I don't care who sees it, babe, I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me (Hey)

I love the way (I love it, I love it)
Baby, I love the way (You make me feel)
Ooh, I love the way, the way I love you
