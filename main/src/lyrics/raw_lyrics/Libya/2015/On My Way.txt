I'm on my way, I'm on my way, ayy

[Verse 1: ILLiJah]
Shawty hit me up late night on my cellphone
Somethin' wasn't right so I told her, "Tell me what's wrong"
Told me that she fiendin' for that good good loving
Told her, "Don't stress, 'cause girl, I'm comin'"
I'm on the way, so girl, be easy
I won't be late, baby believe me
I'm only one call away
So whenever you alone, shawty, call on me
And I'ma be there in a hurry
Just relax, girl, you don't gotta worry
And you don't ever, ever gotta be alone
Girl, all you gotta do is just call my phone
And please believe I'ma pick, pick it up
Now, it don't even matter if I'm busy or what
'Cause I can't get enough, got me lost in your lust
So forget what they say, they don't know about us, nah

[Chorus: ILLiJah]
Shawty, if you want my love
You know all you gotta do is hit me up
And I'll be on my way (and I'll be on my way)
Girl, I'll be on my way
And when you feelin' all alone
You know all you gotta do is call my phone
And I'll be on my way (and I'll be on my way)
Girl, I'll be on my way, ayy

Everything's gonna be oka-a-a-ay
Girl, you got me goin' so crazy-y-y-y
I'm speedin' on the way to ya pla-a-a-ace
Shawty sent me a text
Said she can't wait no more 'cause my love is the best
Girl, your body I'ma kiss and caress
Move ya hands 'cross my chest
And you know what comes next, yes
I'ma feel you up from ya legs to ya neck
Shawty, just lay back, I'll take care of the rest
And you already know what's up
That's why you always call me up, call me up

[Chorus: ILLiJah]
Shawty, if you want my love
You know all you gotta do is hit me up
And I'll be on my way (and I'll be on my way)
Girl, I'll be on my way
And when you feelin' all alone
You know all you gotta do is call my phone
And I'll be on my way (and I'll be on my way)
Girl, I'll be on my way, ayy

[Verse 3: Conman]
Ha, shorty just be easy
Hit me up, I'ma be there when ya need me
Believe me, come on girl, you know that I gotcha
I'll follow your love, baby, somethin' like a stalker
And when I come through, I'ma lay it down
Girl, I handle my business, 'cause I don't play around (yeah)
I'm the one you wanna bring home
Girl, ya got me sprung every time I hear your ring tone
[Chorus: ILLiJah]
Shawty, if you want my love
