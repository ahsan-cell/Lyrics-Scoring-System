(Yola cop bricks)

[Chorus]
I'm addicted to flexin' on my old hoes old hoes
Hand me downs, they ain't worth more than my old clothes
I might fuck her, but I keep that on the low-low, low
Oh, I keep that on the low-low, on the low-low
I think I'm addicted to flexin' on my old hoes
I think I'm addicted to flexin' on my old hoes
I think I'm addicted to flexin' on my old hoes
I think I'm addicted to flexin' on my old hoes
Hoes, flexin' on my old
Hoes, I'm addicted to em'

[Verse 1]
Aright, I flex on my ex, every time that she text me, I'm lookin' like, "Hold up" (Yeah)
I know I'm the shit, but she say I ain't shit and my dick isâ€”, "Bitch, shut up" (Yeah)
I'm takin' my new bitch places, I took her she cannot afford
Then I post it on Instagram stuntin', she tryna ignore it, you mad or nah? (Yeah)
I bought a new whip, just in spite of that bitch, she be catchin' the bus
Seen her, pretend that I'm pickin' her up, when I pulled up, I gave her the finger and, "Skrrt" (Yeah)
I bought her a gift, didn't return it, I took it right back from her
I ain't gon' never gon' get back with her unless she suck me like Dracula, listen, I'm tellin' you
Aright, I see her in public and stunt on a bitch, do you see this coat?
Aright, why keep her around if she just gone drown and jump off the boat?
I lied, I sent her a text and told her I loved her and sent a reply
"Sike", she blow up my phone and won't leave me alone so, "Bitch, bye, yeah"

[Verse 2]
Aright, I show up to all of her family events, 'cause her momma still love me (I love you, momma)
And she got a new nigga, so when I pull up, he be lookin' so jelly (I hate that nigga)
If I'm really on tip, I might even show up with one of her buddies (I fucked her too)
As soon as she come up to hug me, I look and I say, "Bitch what?" (Yeah)
She tell all her friends that I ain't the man, bitch, fuck you mean? (Yeah)
I know that she want me, she peepin' that my Rollie, so fuckin' fleek
And speaking of Rollies, I left her alone, 'cause she wasted my time
She tryna come over and fuck, but I cannot see her, I'm legally blind (Damn)
I'm swaggin', listen, Linda, I'm swaggin'
If you had me, then you a has-been, look at me now, a young nigga flashin'
My new bitches name is Yasmine
I never do cuff em', I pass em' like a college exam
Bitch, I am the man, I don't give a damn so, "Bitch, bye, yeah"
