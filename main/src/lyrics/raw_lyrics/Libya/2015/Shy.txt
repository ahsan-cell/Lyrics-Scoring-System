Every time you walk into the room
Got me feeling crazy
Shock my heart, boom boom
Any other boy would stare
But me, I look away
'Cause you're making me scared

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying not to breathe
One, two, three (Ah)
Trying not to freak when you look at me
Gotta make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me

[Chorus]
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me
Girl you make me shy
Ooooh

Rejection is a word that I don't wanna know
But a girl like you could kill a boy real slow
A million words stuck up in my head
Waiting to be said but my tongue is stumbling

[Pre-Chorus]
Trying not to breathe
One, two, three (Ah)
Trying not to freak when you look at me
Try to make a move but I freeze
You don't have a clue what you do to me

[Chorus]
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me

[Bridge]
Girl, you take me high
I feel like I can fly
But I fall out of the sky
When I look into your eyes, oh, ooh
[Chorus]
Oh girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
You make me run and hide, hide, hide
Feel like I get lost in time
Whenever you're near me
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy
I'm fighting butterfli-fli-flies
Yeah, you make me lose my mind
Whenever you're near me

[Outro]
Girl, you make me shy, yeah yeah, yeah, oh
Girl, you make me shy
Can't even talk to you
Girl, you make me shy6
