You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love

[Verse 1]
I've seen a million dollars in my bank
But it don't mean nothing without you
I've run a long time
I've run a long time
Been feeling myself when I'm without you

You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love

I'd die for you, I'd lie for you
I'd steal for you, I'd cry for you
I ride for you
I'll lie all night underneath the sky with you
And I know that the times right
But I want it all night
You are so damn right
I just wanna hold tight
Fucking every all night
We'll be fucking all night
I just wanna love you
I just feel right
I just wanna touch you
I just wanna squeeze you
I just wanna feel you
I just wanna please you
I just wanna love you
I just wanna see you
I just wanna love, love, love you all night

[Hook]
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
You can buy everything
But you can’t, you can’t buy love
[Outro]
All I wanna, all I wanna do is
All I wanna, all I wanna do is
All I wanna, all I wanna do is love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
I've had my hands tied for so long
I've had my hands tied for so long
I'm floating, I'm floating
I'm floating2
