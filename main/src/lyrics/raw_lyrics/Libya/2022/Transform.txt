We rise and fall
We've seen it all
But something goes much deeper
Who we really are?
What defines us all?
Know that there's no weakness
Still, I wait to change and form
Become the one I am
The journey has begun right now (Oh)
Born from ashes, up we'll go
Calling change, we will transform (Oh)
And the storms are fading now
I can finally start it all
'Cause the times are changing
Now that we transform
And the winds will come in
And the walls will all fall down
'Cause the times are changing
Now that we, now that we transform
