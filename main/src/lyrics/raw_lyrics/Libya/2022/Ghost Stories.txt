If I don't have an angel watching me
My nightmare will become reality
I'm afraid to fall back into sleep
I can see the demon right in front of me

I can see the demon right in front of me!

[Instrumental]

If I don't have an angel watching me
My nightmare will become reality
I'm afraid to fall back into sleep
I can feel the demon deep inside of me

[Instrumental]

Deep inside of me!
