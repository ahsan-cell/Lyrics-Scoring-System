Yeah
Hence the previous song ends but my rhyme bangs, still
May it be a glitch?
Dunno how do I feel
After a long emotional spectre

[Chorus 1]
It collapsed all the life in me
Weak tone, wicked bands through the library
What's the chance to derive my whole might clearly?
Move your tongue, hair strands are so light 'n' beaming

[Post-Chorus]
Though I'm lone now
Slowly getting on a stage
Though I'm broke, out
Of the stuff I'd promised, age
Was fifteen
Still on the same page
Human is lost within the phase he cannot change, ay

[Verse 1]
Luminous light inside the car, mhm-mhm
Tremendous fight against Karma, mhm-mhm
You don't have to be me for a while, uh-uh
'Cause I disclosed all the meaning in one MP3 file
Limit is reached, don't wanna hear you, don't dial, uh
That dashed line to my future, I ain't gonna lie, uh
Me and Cash are mutual, but I have to die
"Even though this style completely suits you, please, do not deny it"
Someone told me I forgot about the main thing
"When you rap, you always need to switch the rhyme"
Shut the fuck up, that's my feelings I derive
Maintain this blatant, plain taint
I expected more from that plain-Jane
She wasn't a diamond, I had to break the relation chain
It wasn't you, it wasn't me also
Just hope, son, fullfill the hole
So gorgeous pain I ought to mend by my tracks
No NASCAR, still broke and out of luck, it doesn't change
Everything about my name that will be blended in the sound space
Past scars revealed in the present dark range
Loading a world preset, I believe I won't waste
Every moment in my memory. Beneath heavy cheques
Is something I don't comprehend, so I'm stuck in a maze
Legends affect the soul â€” thanks Juice, thanks X
Do you want to imagine who's next? (Who's next)
Will be keepin' a precious upper hand?
Why don't we stop preachin' nonsense
Lying to ourselves without facts?
You might also like[Chorus 2]
It's, perhaps, fallin' down quickly
Special zone, weekend ends, last time I'm merry
Just enhance every drive, spotlight, airy
Butterflies in my mind, describe You and I married

[Post-Chorus]
Though I'm lone now
Slowly getting on a stage
Though I'm broke, out
Of the stuff I'd promised, age
Was fifteen
Still on the same page
Human is lost within the phase he cannot change

[Versus 2]
Face to face vs frenemies in my head (face to face)
A mimic ass showin' off with VVS (Fake shit)
Yeah, on such a fake-shit we have to glance
Can I believe myself later when I'm just amas-sing
My skill of being messy and still?
An awkward feeling of being in a carousel of thrill
First steps up to fame will reveal
My incessant willpower
Could it devour me totally?
Me, myself and I are living in a gruesome period
When every hero dies by inner villains
Leavin' a mear civilian
Alone with a muddy feeling that
Demeanor be not brilliant
I finally phoned my hoe, she's really mad
But my loans counter gained billion
Problems
More yet poppin' up
I solve 'em with my wallet
Sell 'em Ganja
Autopilot
Engaged
Chill, we ballin'
A lotta love was fallin'
Like petals of blue orchid
Whirl swept across and tore a kid's heart
I'm not kiddin', indeed
Did I miss how it bleeds?
If I be challengin' my wit
The plan's a blitzkrieg
It depends on how quickly
I might damage and risk
Someone's breath at one time, brisk
Mind
Can't find a pure inkling
Robots are saying that's a big test for your wellbeing
Stimulate ya brain, incomin' ordeal is big
Sight seeing is not for me, I'm spitting
Shit that got to be self-teaching
Your ass cappin', you breachin'
I'm a rascal, killin' my bitches
By the way, I know about the best peception in my life
Let my thoughts fly and elevate so many levels
Evade the drastic rebels, put away that knife
Many things passed, the new becomes to unravel
Anyway
[Chorus 1]
It collapsed all the life in me
Weak tone, wicked bands through the library
What's the chance to derive my whole might clearly?
Move your tongue, hair strands are so light 'n' beaming

[Post-Chorus]
Though I'm lone now
Slowly getting on a stage
Though I'm broke, out
Of the stuff I'd promised, age
Was fifteen
Still on the same page
Human is lost within the phase
