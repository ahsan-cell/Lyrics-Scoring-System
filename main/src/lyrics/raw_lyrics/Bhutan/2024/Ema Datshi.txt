I got killer crowns
I got stats, that's plenty
Kill the track how I knock out deadbeats
Business man
I drink red that's cherry
Matjani goons
How these fraud gon' test me huh
Man in a suit
They gon' move when the crew pulls up
In a brand new Bentley huh
Sick of this dude
Acting rude
Got my boots in their face
They gon' beg to be set free
Winning big like a sweepstake
Kill 'em quick that's a briefcase
Finished him in a freeze frame
They be two faced like a deep fake
Ain't no debatе
They get broken drеams
I got green days
Call the doctor in if you feel faint
Tally votes up
They got no luck
Up there own arse
Like a bidet
Two rounds
Coming like my spectacles
Unethical
Send dots like its decimals
Detestable
The fit is exceptional
Respectable
Don't mess with professionals
I'll be raking votes like collectables
Angry get 'em out like a technical
I be sick of these fake intellectuals
Your bars shit if you just Gon forget them all

Thunderclap
Run it back
One attack and he's finished
Thunder crash
Hunter class
Want to clash he get lifted
Sudden dash
Run his cash
If you blink you might miss it
Cut his cap
While he nap
Shout out Kreuger no biscuit
Looking for a killer call it kamikaze
If you find me in the field (damn)
I'm just tryna keep it real
If I only cut you I cut you a deal
Family chopper
I send the birds at him
Word to Tsubone, canary
The rounds that I carry could body a fairy
I walk with that Tommy if he acting Jerry
He gone go head
Go for Gon's head
Then we gone shed blood
Give me the go ahead
And imma throw the set down
Boy you messed up
Body the lobby the second time around
I'm getting the test done
They know I'm a problem
I already solved 'em
Now I'm a rhetorical question
VERSE 3 : AERIAL ACE - KURAPIKA

8 leg fucks who the fuck did you fake out
Come on Webster see what my name bout
My impulse in the mood for a takeout
I'm finna feed of a stakeout
You finna know the extent of my index
Cards pulled when I read, no index
I'm a problem that ignores all Pemdas
Hang game like a chain gang
When yo pinned set
Working motherfuckers
Work 'em till their fucking judgement day
When this chain douse
You gon' find an out
You living life is not one today
If yo zodiac tell you I'm a rat
Then I guess the metal got a lot to say
Make 'em lean back as I rock away
Then I lean back hit the baka face
Where I'm seen at see a brother
Brother never seen another make us duck and cover
Drop 'em from the logo like its Hunter Hunter
Hunna motherfuckers end up in the gutter
Till we paid
I'm linked in
This red sight on me like Wanda
I peek at your brain
Watchu thinking
On they Ant Man shit they numbers is shrinking
VERSE 4 : BREETON BOI - GON

Watch on my wrist like: gone
Dropping these hits like Gon
Said they want beef with the kid
But when it comes to the action
Guess what
GONE
Too afraid to come face to face
You make mistakes with me
You'll get laid to waste
You best vacate the scene
Cause I hate to say
That if you placed 'gainst me
You won't leave complacent
That's a heavy statement
And I back it up
Cause I'm a freak of nature
And I've had enough
Everything till now has been a practice run
And right when duty calls
I tend to pack a punch
If you need a task done
Guess who they asking
They done passed me the beat and I enhanced it
It get tragic for opps tryna get static
Cause I'm rolling with Killua he the best at it
Peep my demeanour now
Cause I ain't playing games when I go shoot
Rock, paper, scissors to your whole crew
Tryna step to me would be a bold move
I would never pit you against me
Y'all are some ants, insignificant beings
Don't care 'bout your status
Its nothing to me
If you crossing my path Imma leave you deceased (sheesh)
