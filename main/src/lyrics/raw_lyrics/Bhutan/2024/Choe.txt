[Outro]
Hum-buh-che-ka-la-ma-ka-la-ka-ku-ku-che!
My train of thought
Will not be bought
On prime time
Saturday night sex crime
Not that I'm
Above it all
I hear the call
To the side perhaps
Or not at all
No time has elapsed
Spirit doesn't collapse
The Indians are still here
To me
I see them all around
There's one now with a spear
He doesn't need a gun
He can run like the wind
Or burn like the sun
And what about the dinosaur?
They sing their songs through Dinah Shore
See the U.S.A. 
In your Chevrolet
Thеy took their dive
So that we can drivе
Aren't they still alive
On the West Side Highway?
No? Well, that's what you say
I'd be glad to leave well enough alone
If well enough would just throw me a bone
Of contention
Invention
The entertainment of gods
The celestial gambler
Unafraid of the odds
'Cause sometimes to win is to lose
And to lose is the blues
But the blues can get you through
Those flat and busted dues
So for people like me and you's
No choice to choose
One way
Sun play
Fish will fly
When night is dayYou might also like
