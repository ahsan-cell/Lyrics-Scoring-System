I’ve always had people say
Donald you have the most beautiful hands

[Verse 1]

Hey girl it’s me
D-O-N-A-L-D
Don’t you believe what you read in the news
It’s not true
I really want to get with you I do
So if you’re not Rosie O’Donnell
I’ll let you go ahead
And fondle my long golden hair
I don’t care, as long as Megan Kelly’s not there
So if you’ve got double D’s
And you’re not to ugly
You might be lucky enough to play with my
Play with my

[Chorus]

Tiny Love Hands, tiny love hands, tiny love hands
Oh let me touch you with my tiny love hands
Tiny Love Hands, tiny love hands
Oh let me touch you with my tiny love hands
They’re super small
You probably won’t even feel them at all

Not trying to make you a hoe
Just got to let you know
That’s the way I show my love
By grabbing you by your
P-U-S-S-Y
Just let me run my tiny fingers
Up and down your inner thighs
If you tell anyone I’ll just deny
It’s not my fault you’re so sexy
It makes me assault you sexually
And even if you were my daughter
And I was your father
I’d give you all my family jewels
Do the nasty things that lovers do
With my, with my

[Chorus]

Tiny Love Hands, tiny love hands, tiny love hands
Oh let me touch you with my tiny love hands
Tiny Love Hands, tiny love hands
Oh let me touch you with my tiny love hands
Tiny Love Hands, tiny love hands
Oh let me touch you with my tiny love hands
Tiny Love Hands, tiny love hands
[Outro]

Let me tough you girl
I just want to reach out and grab you girl
You’re so beautiful
I can’t help myself when I look at you in the eyes
I just want to touch you everywhere
Do you blame me girl, you’re so sexy
I also got a tiny dick
I got a super tiny dick
