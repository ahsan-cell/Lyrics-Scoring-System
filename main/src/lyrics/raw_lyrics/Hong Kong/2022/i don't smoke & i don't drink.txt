[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
(Ayy, Silverstrike 'bout to light it up)

[Verse]
I'm not joking
I don't smoke and I don't drink
(Leave me alone)
I've said this shit a million billion trillion times
(Oh not again)
They be looking at me like they haven't seen this type of guy
I don't know why
(Oh one more time)
I'm not joking
I don't smoke and I don't drink
(I don't I don't)
I've said this shit a million billion trillion times
(Too many times)
They be looking at me like they haven't seen this type of guy
I don't know why
Which type of guy do I look like?

[Chorus]
I wonder why
又要再講幾多次
How many times
外表太壞 得到這反應
早已見怪不怪
2019 Mademan Taipei
最後一次飲醉
表演慶功 I got my crew and twenty-three, yeah
施展武功躲走半天 I'm pretty knackered
在夜深三點計劃很可惜也
(Fail)
Half shot of whiskey
That's what
What they gave me
I'm not joking
I'm not joking
I'm not!

[Bridge]
Now I got this pain inside my head
後悔沒有堅決拒絕 say no
(No-no-no-no-no)
對這班酒鬼心死
God damn!
這魔鬼般的心地
(Ooh) I can hear them laughing in my face
(Yeah in my face)
心想一班兄弟為我頂
(Come on)
I was thinking too much I know
My face is getting red
(It's turning red turning red)
