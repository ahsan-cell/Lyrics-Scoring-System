[主歌一]
兩個也太易被騙
你說兩個都充滿優點
綑綁式三角每天
都給一些假希望霸占
她跟她因你掛牽
拖拖拉拉留在交叉點太可憐
你冷眼看著混戰
扮做受害人行騙
兩個都愛 三個人冒險

[副歌]
You always fall in love with two at a time
I never wanted you to keep me on your mind, oh you
偽善地用你膚淺的溫柔來俘虜兩個心
(You, every time you fall)
You always fall in love with two at a time
請解決彼此不清不楚的身份 Hmm
浪漫地扮作一起卻被軟禁
You don't know how I feel
You never do

[主歌二]
兩個有兩份自我
你說兩個都非愛不可 Hmm
她跟她給你教唆
她跟她根本都沒有錯 (Ooh-yeah)
花開都不會結果 (Ah, ah)
應不應該挪用她青春去消磨 (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
兩個替你妒忌過
是誤會釀成難過
你卻偷笑 感到殘酷麼？

[過渡]
愛情純屬消遣的籌碼
Just let me tell you, now just let me tell you
愛情難道這麼的廉價
專一的她的專一 你明白嗎？

[副歌]
You always fall in love with two at a time
(I never) Wanted you to keep me on your mind, oh no
傲慢地用你精巧的謊言難為兩個女生
(You, you, every time you fall)
You always fall in love with two at a time
(How could you)
How could you tell me all your lies?
寂寞亦別要分享你十個吻
You don't know how I feel
Maybe you do, hm, mmm
