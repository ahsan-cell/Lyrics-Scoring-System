[前奏: AGA 江海迦, Ghost Style]
Hey
Ya?
I need to tell you something
Uh-huh, what's that?

[主歌一: AGA 江海迦]
但願沒什麼拉扯與糾纏
故事維持不變
但是近日竟心虛到失眠
我們無法逃避這局面

[導歌: AGA 江海迦]
(知否真的真的) 想與你回到 最愛當天
(知否真的真的) 想回頭 停留你身邊
(可惜一不小心) 拉斷愛情線
相戀已變成爛笑片 怎麼飾演都不夠自然 Eh-eh, eh

[副歌: AGA 江海迦]
It's 3 a.m. in the morning and I don't know how to say goodbye
但你應該知道我們情境多尷尬 (Bye, bye, baby you know I know)
如假開心開心開始假得很 倒不攤開這張牌
但我感到內疚戀上別人這樣壞
It's 3 a.m. in the morning baby don't you ask me why, yeah

念在是互相珍惜過的人
我才言辭抖震
為盡量避免傷得太深層
告別仍然留在你附近

[導歌: AGA 江海迦]
(終於真的真的) 不再有情意 對你傾心
(終於真的真的) 不同行 仍然我感恩
(今天不知怎麼) 討厭了熱吻
彷彿太脆弱太敏感 不堪一擊的戀愛病人 Eh-eh, eh

[副歌: AGA 江海迦]
It's 3 a.m. in the morning and I don't know how to say goodbye
但你應該知道我們情境多尷尬 (Bye, bye, baby you know I know)
如假開心開心開始假得很 倒不攤開這張牌
但我感到內疚戀上別人這樣壞
It's 3 a.m. in the morning baby don't you ask me why, yeah, yeah

[主歌三: Ghost Style & AGA 江海迦, AGA 江海迦]
Hey bae, uh
I know ya
Get close tonight we let it go, huh
No need to feel guilty
‘Cause we all free
Like you on my mind, every time I'm with my side piece, woo! (You know, I know)
It's a cold world
I guess I gotta deal with it
You like the only girl
Who could have been my Juliette
But this ain't no Hollywood
It's all good
Honesty vibe-3am goodbye
It's 3 a.m., it's 3 a.m
[副歌: AGA 江海迦, Ghost Style]
Maybe it is 3 a.m. in the morning and I don't know how to say goodbye (Woo! Yeah, yeah)
在我這邊廂有個無人知的世界
(Bye, bye, 'cause you know I know) [?]
而假天真天真開始假得很 (Uh-huh)
東歪西倒似骨牌
令我羞愧自責戀上別人太失敗 (Do what you gotta do, uh-huh, yeah)
It's 3 a.m. in the morning baby don't you ask me why, yeah, yeah

[結局: AGA 江海迦, Ghost Style]
3 a.m. (Ya)
3 a.m. (Ooh-ooh, hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Uh-huh)
3 a.m. (Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooo-ooh-ooh-ah)
(It's 3 a.m. baby)
3 a.m
Don't, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't, baby don't
3 a.m
3 a.m. (It's running out of time)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, baby don't (Guess this is the last time)
3 a.m. (Oh-hoo-ooh)
(History, I know, I know, yeah)
It's 3 a.m., baby don't you ask me why
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah, yeah (Yeah I know, it's all good)
