If you guys know it

[Verse 1]
I heard you like to go out late at night
Dance around the amber of the southern lights
Knew you were home by the creak in the floor
Your foot silhouette under a bedroom door

[Verse 2]
Drivin' me home at 7 AM
Hand in mine like a heaven-sent hymn
Movin' and shakin' like the ramblers do
After gettin' through the days I never thought I'd get through

[Chorus]
'Cause you bring heaven down to me
Coursin' through my blood as I breathe
I bet the angels are jealous of a girl I know
She takes my stain and makes me white as snow
White as snow, ooh

[Break]
Thank you guys so much

[Verse 3]
I hear Jesus makes sin white as linen
Like the sheets that we're in and your teeth when you're grinnin'
Take it away and you give it to God
Like the night you dumped out all the liquor I bought

There's a way the grass smells on a summer night
When it's freshly cut, the moisture's right
It's nights like these in the August heat
I think the devil's just another boy I can beat

[Chorus]
'Cause you bring heaven down to me
Coursin' through my blood as I breathe
I bet the angels are jealous of a girl I know
She takes my stain and makes me white as snow
White as snow, ooh

[Bridge]
I heard you like to go out late at night
Dance around the amber of the southern lights
Knew you were home by a creak in the floor
Foot silhouette under a bedroom door

[Break]
I got one more chorus for you guys
If you guys wanna sing "Snow" in the snow with me, let's do it, huh?

[Chorus]
'Cause you bring heaven down to me
Coursin' through my blood as I breathe
I bet the angels are jealous of a girl I know
She takes my stain and makes me white as snow (Ayy)
White as snow, ooh
[Outro]
Thank you guys
