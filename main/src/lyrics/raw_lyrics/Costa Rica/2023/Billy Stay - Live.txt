Billy, won't you stay? You've been up all night
Talkin' 'bout flowers from '65
The print on that dress that you always liked
When we were young enough to go out and dance at night

[Verse 2]
We'd cross the street and you'd hold my hand
Same man now that you were back then
Young kids, good for nothin' but high hopin'
Broke and starvin', plastic ring perfect for elopin'

[Verse 3]
The years went by fast, you were so good to me
Our children have children, Billy, how could it be?
But ninety years is nothin' to some kids like us
So, baby, stick around and tell a story just because

[Chorus]
Billy, stay a while
Lately, you've been slippin' in and out
Billy, stay a child
Tell mе 'bout that girl you dreamed about
Billy, stay a while
Tеll me of the lovers who once were
Billy, stay a child
Tell me 'bout that girl and how you loved her

Billy, don't forget, won't you keep on tryin'?
I'll keep my ears open to keep from cryin'
You're more handsome now than you were back then
And I'm the same girl you fell for when we were kids

[Verse 5]
If love was enough, then you'd stay forever
But I guess sometimes that the end is better
'Cause love turns to loss as the time goes by
You don't know your own name, but you know mine

[Chorus]
Billy, stay a while
Lately, you've been slippin' in and out
And, Billy, stay a child
Tell me 'bout that girl you dreamed about
Billy, stay a while
Tell me of the lovers who once were
Billy, stay a child
Tell me 'bout that girl and how you loved her

[Outro]
You went back home in your sleep last night
And I heard you whisper, "I love you, goodbye"
But maybe your heaven's 1965
With your hair in my face on a warm summer drive
To me, you'll never be the times you forgot
But all of our good times and the flowers you bought
[Spoken]
Thank you guys so much
