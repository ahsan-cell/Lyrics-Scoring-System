Remember when David dashed a twelve-pack
Of Budweiser Heavy for the road?
Two kids in the back, drunk off their ass
Screamin' in an old Bronco

[Chorus]
I recall what she said
That she wanted me dead
There ain't no grave deep enough
Remember all the nights we had
I say it ain't so bad
Keep those heavy eyes lookin' up

[Verse 2]
Remember when Mary brought her own Jane?
Lucas thought he was gonna die
'Cause stars startеd fallin' out the night clouds
From a clear, midwestеrn sky

[Chorus]
I recall what she said
Screamin' that the sky was red
It's burned into a younger man's mind
Remember all the days we had
I say it ain't so bad
Keep those heavy eyes soft and kind

Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Who's gonna drive us home, my boys and me?
Our walkin' staggered, vision blurred
One thing you'll come to know, them boys back home
Live for things like Dead Man's Curve

[Chorus]
And I recall what he said
He'd rather be gone and dead
Than livin' like those sad folks in town
I can't take this soul with me
If I go, I'm goin' quickly
Keep those heavy eyes free and proud

[Refrain]
Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'
[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'

[Break]
Think you got, uh, one more in you, Red Rocks?
Thank you guys so much for bearin' with us all night

[Refrain]
Oh, when I'm old, I will recall
All the nights we spent outlaws
It's gettin' cold, that sun is crestin'
And heavy eyes ain't born for restin'
