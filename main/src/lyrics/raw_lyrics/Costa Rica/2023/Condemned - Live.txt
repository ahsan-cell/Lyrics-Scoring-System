I'm condemned, I'm condemned, oh, my heart is on the mend
Nobody gives a damn about me
You can tell me that you love me 'til your little lungs turn blue
But I'm always alone when I fall asleep
And the girls that walk downtown are like some stars that fell to earth
Like the veins in my arms, the story in my hurt
And the boys, they always tell me my words get 'em by
They can tell how much I mean it by the bloodshot in my eye

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't try to make it my fault
If you plan on leaving, don't come at all
Lord knows no glory in thе fall
If no one's around at the end of it all

[Chorus]
I'm condеmned, I'm condemned, oh, my heart is on a mend
Looking for somebody who can save me
I'm condemned, I'm condemned, just like all my worthless friends
Waiting on the wind to set us free

[Verse 2]
Well the debt that I've been after, all the booze and all the laughter
I guess that's just what makes us who we are
And the people that we lose and the battles that we choose
Have you pining for something too damn far

So don't try to make it my fault
If you plan on leaving, don't come at all
Lord knows no glory in the fall
If no one's around at the end of it all
No one's around at the end of it all

[Chorus]
I'm condemned, I'm condemned, oh, my heart is on the mend
Nobody gives a damn about me
You can tell me that you love me 'til your little lungs turn blue
But I'm always alone when I fall asleep
