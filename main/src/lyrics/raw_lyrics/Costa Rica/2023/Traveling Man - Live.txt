I'm just a travelin' man, you see
Wherever this road goes is where I will be
And I'll catch me a ride on a boat to Spain
Tell a woman that I love her, then forget her name
And I wish I could stay for midday coffee
But I just can't get this dreamin' off me
If I could find me a place to rest my mind
Well, Mama always said you'll get there in good time

[Chorus]
Well, there's some headlights burnin' down the highway
And I think that I may hitch me a ride
I'm a travelin' man by trade, sir
We're all runnin' from the things inside

[Verse 2]
There's a train headin' west to south Toledo
If the dogs don't sell me, asleep I'll go
Dreamin' as I'm steamin' past miles of ground
Through the souls and hymnals that built this town
I won't stay too long or leave too soon
The best time for goin' is when the goin' scares you

[Chorus]
There's some headlights burnin' down the highway
And I think that I may hitch me a ride
'Cause I'm a travelin' man by trade, sir
We're all runnin' from the things inside

There's some headlights burnin' down the highway
And I think that I may just hitch me a ride
'Cause I'm a travelin' man by trade, sir
We're all runnin' from the things inside

[Outro]
My harmonica holder grabbed my beer
The entire time I was singin' that, it like ripped my whole, uh
Alright, yeah, yeah
Sorry, guys, how's everyone doin'?
