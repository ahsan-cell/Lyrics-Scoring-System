We could find a porch to hold us where we could all scream "Childers"
Drink the shit that kills us until we all remember
Who it was when we were younger before the world took our pride
We were walkin' in straight lines tryin' to find who's good to drive

[Verse 2]
And I've had so many evenings, the way I felt I can't recall
Was I jumpin' from the rafters when my buddies broke my fall?
By the end of the night, well, we'd be flyin' or cryin'
Talkin' 'bout the times we've spent livin' towards dyin'

[Chorus]
So don't stop runnin', boy, but don't be naive
'Cause this world will break and burn you worse than hearts like ours believe
Don't stop dancin', girl, 'til it feels right
We'll be flyin' or cryin' by the end of the night

[Verse 3]
You always snuck up in my front seat with some reasons of your own
Tryin' to get a plainsman drunk and all alone
But don't you go fallin' for and don't you go believin'
A boy with calloused hands with a mind set on leavin'

[Chorus]
So don't stop runnin', boy, but don't be naive
'Cause this world will break and burn you worse than hearts like ours believe
Don't stop dancin', girl, 'til it feels right
We'll be flyin' or cryin' by the end of the night

All the moments that we've been through, all the memories we've made
I don't think God'd be willin' to come down here and save
Some heathens from the flatlands who only bitch and moan
But if I'm goin' down, least I'm not goin' down alone

[Chorus]
Don't stop runnin', boy, but don't be naive
'Cause this world will break and burn you worse than hearts like ours believe
Don't stop dancin', girl, 'til it feels right
We'll be flyin' or cryin' by the end of the night

[Outro]
Okay, we made it through it alright, that was a shocker
Killed it, thank you guys so much
