Lonely, longin' troubadour, I know that you've been here before
But there ain't no cure for a restless man
If you came to run from your bad reputation
To sleep in wherever you land
What state you in tonight and did you get into a fight?
Are you more drunk than you were last week?
When I call you on the phone, you are never alone
And your jaw's sewn closed when you speak

[Chorus]
She said, "Run down the road, go where you need to go
But I need you to understand
There ain't no home and there is no cure
For a no-good ramblin' man"

[Verse 2]
Lonely, longin' troubadour, you ain't the boy you were before
This world has truly thickened your skin
'Cause everyone you talk to acts like they walked through
Hell with you way back when
Who are you to say I can't live this way?
I was born to be a man of the night
I'm twelve foot tall and I'm livin' proof
That highway boys don't die

"So run down the road, go where you need to go
But I need you to understand
There ain't no home and there is no cure
For a no-good ramblin' man"

[Break]
How we doin', Red Rocks?

[Chorus]
Said, "Run down the road, go where you need to go
But I need you to understand
There ain't no home and there is no cure
For a no-good ramblin' man"

[Outro]
Hope everyone's feelin' alright
I, uh, I released an album a long time ago called DeAnn
My entire family's here
Not to be depressing, she is not and I wish she was, um
This is a song I wrote for her called "Sweet DeAnn"
