You feelin' good tonight?
I know I am

[Verse 1]
There was a boy who was a dreamer and he flew so high and proud
In a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
No one ever understood a single word he said
And they cast him to the wolves when he wasn't well and fed

[Verse 2]
Well, boys, we've got a riser, a riser in our midst
And he will get the last laugh if it's the last thing he did
He used to roll around in that red dirt mud
But now he's skippin' town and that riser's out for blood
If you're with me, Red Rocks

[Chorus]
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop headin', headin' south
They will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth

[Break]
Thank you guys

Then that boy, he called his daddy to tell him what he did
As the masses scream the lyrics of a messed up kid
And then he told that old man he was never comin' back
To be cut down again in a town like that

[Bridge]
Then he surely came to learn people come to watch you fall
But he's out to make a name and a fool out of 'em all
They'll never understand that boy and his kind
'Cause all they comprehend is a fuckin' dollar sign

[Chorus]
So don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop headin', headin' south
They will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth

[Break]
Alright, if you're with us tonight
I can't thank you enough
I don't deserve any of ya

[Chorus]
So don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop headin', headin' south
They will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth
[Outro]
Thank you guys so much for sittin' through the cold for me, I really appreciate it
