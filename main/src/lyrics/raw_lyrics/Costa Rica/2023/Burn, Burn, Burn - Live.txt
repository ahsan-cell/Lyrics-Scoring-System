Well, everyone seems a damn genius lately
Tik-Tok talkin', late-night TV
There's still so much I have yet to know
Get dressed up just to go downtown
In some ego-filled late-night crowd
Seems to be where I feel most alone

[Verse 2]
I'd like to get lost on some old back road
And find a shade tree and a honey hole
And talk to my grandpa again
I see God in everything
Trees and pain and nights in spring
So why do I still long for a home?

[Verse 3]
I'd like to lay in a field on a cozy blanket
And feel the fear of never wakin'
To know the true warmth of the sun
I'd like to love my lady long and hard
And lay down lines of layman guitar
And never leave her lovin' arms again

[Verse 4]
My exes hate me and my friends all miss me
I wanna drown in rotgut whiskey
Leave this small town for a while

I wanna be a child climbin' trees somewhere
Breathin' in the fresh, outside air
Before I knew this life was unkind
I want a well-trained dog on a couple of acres
A kind, kind lady and a place to take her
Few good friends I can count on one of my hands

[Verse 6]
I know I'm bound to die one day
So when I reach those golden gates
I pray to say I did the best I can
Sit with my mother and the dearly departed
Send a prayer down to the broken-hearted
Let 'em know it all turns out just fine

[Verse 7]
To know me is to love me and to hate me is to wrong me
I prefer my nights so lonely
Love blues guitar, muscle cars, and gin
'Cause I'm a simple man, I don't need much
Just my simple songs and some human touch
Tired now, so I'm bringin' my ass home

[Chorus]
So let me go down the line
I wanna feel it all, joy, pain, and sky
So let me go down the line
'Cause we all burn, burn, burn, and die
So let me go down the line
I wanna feel it all, joy, pain, and sky
So let me go down the line
We all burn, burn, burn, and die
So let me go down the line
I wanna feel it all, joy, pain, and sky
Let me go down the line
We all burn, burn, burn, and die
[Break]
I got one more chorus for you guys if you wanna be in it
To the heavens, huh?

[Chorus]
So let me go down the line
I wanna feel it all, joy, pain, and sky
So let me go down the line
'Cause we all burn, burn, burn, and die

[Outro]
Red Rocks, huh?
