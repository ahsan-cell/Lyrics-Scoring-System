You remember sittin' there
On a rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance

[Verse 2]
You said his life took most of you
Gave you twice and the day was through
And you said it all turned out awfully fair
So tell me tales of all the times
And all the seasons you got by
Breathin' in that cold November air

[Refrain]
When no one was there
No one was there
No one was there

[Verse 3]
Two kids 'bout twenty-three
And the sunsets you'll never see
You were yellin' "supper" from the yard
And they grew old and sailed away
Called you on phones from far away
Wrote you novels on postcards
See Zach Bryan LiveGet tickets as low as $111You might also like[Verse 4]
And all you ever wanted
Was to see your children fly
Maybe one day, the pair are stars
But there ain't no leavin'
This small town this evenin'
'Cause you can't even drive your own car

[Refrain]
Through November air
November air
November air

[Chorus]
So dear Mama, how's it goin'?
Was the weather fair last week?
Dear Mama, they were wonderful
All the sights you'll never see
And dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms
Tell you what it means
That you could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
And make him mean something

[Verse 5]
Tell us what you wanted to
And all we did was needed you
And your dreams were too small to care
But I'm always reminded
If you look hard, you'll find it
Your memory gives warmth to right here
[Refrain]
Through November air
November air, you guys got it?
November air

[Chorus]
So dear Mama, how's it goin'?
Was the weather fair last week?
Dear Mama, they were wonderful
All the sights you'll never see
Dear Mama, if I could hold you, I'd grab you by the arms
And tell you what it means
That you could take a worthless poor boy from the flats
And make him mean something

[Break]
Got one more for ya

[Verse 6]
You remember sittin' there
On a rainy night in a well-used chair
Tellin' me how well you used to dance
The western wind will come again
And make you feel like you did
When all those cowboys didn't stand a chance
[Refrain]
Through November air
November air
November air

[Outro]
