I came to burn Red Rocks down if you guys are here with me

[Verse 1]
I heard you died out in Cheyenne
With my mother's ring on your hand
Note in your pocket said "I'll love you 'til I die"
I can hear the bulls are comin'
To claim what they've been huntin'
Blood of the cowboy came to claim his daddy's right
And my baby, she's been cryin'
At the thought of me dyin'
She knows there's no stoppin' a man and his foolish pride

[Chorus]
Open the gates 'cause I'm here to prove
I'm better than my father was, where he came from too
Open the gates, I'm here to ride
To Hell I go with Daddy by my side

[Post-Chorus]
How we feelin' this evenin'?

[Verse 2]
And I ain't never feared nothin'
That was four-legged and buckin'
Throw me on a hurricane and I'll ride it to the coast
You'll never know that your son
Came to do what you shoulda done
A long, long time ago on top a bull named To Hell I Go
It's on y'all

Open the gates 'cause I'm here to prove
I'm better than my father was, where he came from too
Open the gates 'cause I'm here to ride
To Hell I go with Daddy by my side

[Bridge]
And I died out in Cheyenne
With my baby there cryin'
And a belly that's been growin' by the day
You'll never know that your son
Came to do what you shoulda done
A long, long time ago on top a bull named To Hell I Go

[Chorus]
So open the gates 'cause I'm here to prove
I'm better than my father was, where he came from too
Open the gates, I'm here to ride
To Hell I go with Daddy by my side

[Outro]
Hope everyone's doin' okay, stayin' warm
We ain't leavin'
Hey, uh, this is a song I wrote a long time ago called "God Speed," hope you guys don't hate it
