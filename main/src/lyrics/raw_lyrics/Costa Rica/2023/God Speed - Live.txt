Thank you guys so much for bein' here
Each and every one of y’all, it's unbelievable

[Verse 1]
Well, I wanna send a post card
From the edge of a place I've never been
And I wanna make love hard
Under the stars in the back of a beat-up ol’ K-10
And I wanna love a girl who
Doesn't worry about the pictures when we kiss
Wake up one day and not be so hit-and-miss
Lay in bed all day and call that shit pure bliss
Alright, if you're with us tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm movin' at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me

[Verse 2]
And I wanna see the road melt
Into the mountains away as I drive
And make it out of this damn town alive
And not let the dreams I shoulder die

'Cause I'm movin’ at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me

[Bridge]
And I wanna die an old man
With messed-up stories of me and all my old friends
And laugh about how we all thought it won’t end
And how we all wind up where we begin

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I’m movin' at God speed
Where only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me

[Break]
So I know many of you guys travelled, huh
To get right here at Red Rocks on this cold, cold evenin'
So I want us all to enjoy it as much as we possibly can
Thank you

[Chorus]
'Cause I’m movin' at God speed
Where only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
Movin' at God speed
[Outro]
Thank you, uh
Me and the boys here have had a year, um
Been on plenty of highways
