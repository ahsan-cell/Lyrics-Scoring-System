I'd be callin' you right about now
Tell you stories of a pretty fine gal
Remind you of the things that your boy's into
How he looks and he acts and he talks like you

[Verse 2]
This world's not meant for showin' mercy
I've got pictures of us that hurt me
'Cause I'm squeezin' you and you're smilin' through
That flash upon the wall

[Chorus]
Sweet DeAnn, I miss you so
And your words go where I go
The reasons I don't know
But I'll scream 'em loud and slow
So you can hear me from the Heavens
And you can call my thunder down
I miss havin' you around
But in my heart, you're always found

[Verse 3]
You always sat there with me
And you cried every time I played keen
You said your boy would bе seen
By the masses someday

But I don't want thе stage
And I don't want the girls
I want back the days
That you were breathin' in this world

[Chorus]
Sweet DeAnn, I miss you so
And your words go where I go
And the reasons I don't know
So I'll scream 'em loud and slow
So you can hear me from the Heavens
And you can call my thunder down
I miss havin' you around
But in my heart, you're always found

[Chorus]
Sweet DeAnn, I miss you so
And your words go where I go
The reasons I don't know
But I'll scream 'em loud and slow
So you can hear me from the Heavens
And you can call my thunder down
I miss havin' you around
But in my heart, you're always found
[Outro]
I wouldn't be here without my mama
She used to sit on the tailgate with me and listen to me play music
So, uh, yeah, thank you guys for bearin' with me through this cold night
Here's a sudden change of mood, uh
This is a song I wrote called "Heading South"
