There is concrete below me and a sky above so blue
I'm finally leavin' Denver and I wish it was with you
I am just a sickness and you seem to be the cure
How much can a southern girl honestly endure?
Remember northwest mountains, they were snow-capped in June
You were nappin' on my arm, it was on a Sunday afternoon
But, babe, I've gotta heal myself from the things I've never felt
Repression is my heaven, but I'd rather go through hell
If you're with us, Red Rocks

[Chorus]
It's 'bout time that I left Austin, 'bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick as the trains rollin' through town
'Bout time that I face the hard times I've let go
If lovin' you was an ocean, I'da drowned so you could float

[Verse 2]
You remember gettin' drunk on the outskirts of this town
When I gave you all I had, but it still let you down
And everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leavin' tonight

[Chorus]
It's 'bout time that I left Austin, 'bout time you settled down
With a man who doesn't move as quick as the trains rollin' through town
'Bout time that I face the hard times I've let go
If lovin' you was an ocean, I'da drowned so you could float

[Bridge]
There's concrete below me and a sky above so blue
I'm finally leavin' Denver and I wish it was with you
And everyone I've ever loved has either left or died
Wish I was born with concrete shoes, but I'm leavin' tonight

[Chorus]
And I'm finally gone from Austin, you finally settled down
With a man who didn't move as quick as the trains rollin' through town
I finally had to face the hard times I've let go
If lovin' you was an ocean, I'da drowned so you could float

[Outro]
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Everyone feelin' okay?
