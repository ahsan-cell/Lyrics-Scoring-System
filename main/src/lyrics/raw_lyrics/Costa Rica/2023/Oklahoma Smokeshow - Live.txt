Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home, so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue, old pickup truck
You got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up

[Verse 2]
There's so much whiskey in his Coke, it'll make her nose bend
But she swears that his love is a damn godsend
She known God since she was a child
She used to play in the yard and she would dream of one day
'Til the world came around, took her dreamin' away
Told her how to dress and act and smile

[Pre-Chorus]
She's a Colorado smokeshow
He's an asshole from back home
She won't ever make it out alive
Of that small-town bar scene
Where small vices kill your big dreams
He'd take you home, but he's too drunk to drive

[Chorus]
I've been here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' 'bout a life with you and I
One you'll never know
'Cause you're a small-town smokeshow
I've been here, I've been up all night
Thinkin' 'bout a life with you and I
One you'll never know
You're a small-town smokeshow

Go on and put on that dress that all the bad boys like
I know your daddy ain't home, so ride with me tonight
You always wind up here in a puddle of tears
Them boys are out and they're angry and they're lookin' for blood
In the back of a blue, old pickup truck
You got nowhere to go although you're all gussied up

[Outro]
Thank you, guys, so much
I'm gonna, I'm gonna sing a song I usually butcher, uh
This song means a lot to me, means a lot to Read
This is a song I wrote called "Billy Stay"
