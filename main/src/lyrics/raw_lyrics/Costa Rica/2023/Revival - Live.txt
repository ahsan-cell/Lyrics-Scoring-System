I came to blow this nonexistent roof off if you guys are here with me

[Verse 1]
Gather 'round this table, boys
Bring your shame, I'll lose my voice
Screamin' at the gods about the bad we've done
Merle said Mama tried, but the prison still won

[Verse 2]
And your transgressions are mine as well
Anger grows in my bones if you could not tell
But I'll find comfort in company
Lord, forgive us, my boys and me
How we doin', Red Rocks?

[Chorus]
'Cause we're havin' an all-night revival
Someone call the women and someonе steal the Bible
For thе sake of my survival
It's on y'all
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam, put Johnny on the vinyl

[Break]
Feelin' good, how 'bout you guys, huh?

Well, the devil can scrap, but the Lord has won
And I'll talk to him under risin' sun
His son rose and mine did too
Well, I was comin' down, but now I'm talkin' to you

[Chorus]
'Cause we're havin' an all-night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the Bible
For the sake of my survival
Baptize me in a bottle of Beam, put Johnny on the vinyl

We're havin' an all-night revival
Someone call the women and someone steal the Bible

To the best bass player I know
