If the guitar stinks, it's 'cause my fingers are fallin' off

[Verse 1]
Highway boys on the road tonight, got a gig out here in Denver
Finally found out the hard way that all good things take time, friend
Heard they'll pay a lost soul to sing his songs true
Make a southern boy cry or turn a northeast man confused
And I awoke with a fever, sweatin' oceans again
There's mirrors in hotel rooms, but I do not recognize them
Maybe it's the feelin' that I get in my sleep
That all the memories in my mind are only mine to keep
How we doin', Red Rocks?

[Chorus]
I wanna ride that K-10 to way back when
Sleep next to the river, hear it rushin' again
Get my no-good soul back to where it belongs
And do my best to keep truth in songs
And do my best to keep truth in songs

[Verse 2]
And all of my old friends miss havin' me around, but
Highways work both ways and I can't stand the liars in town
So if you need me, you can find me slightly out of control
'Cause highway boys don't rest and don't hang hats 'til they're home
Highway boys on the road tonight, got a gig out here in Denver
They finally found out the hard way that this sound I got is mine, man
See Zach Bryan LiveGet tickets as low as $111You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna ride that K-10 to way back when
Sleep next to the river, hear it rushin' again
Get my no-good soul back to where it belongs
And do my best to keep truth in songs
And do my best to keep truth in songs

[Outro]
So if you need me, call
If you're in love, fall
Just know that highway boys don't stick around at all
Thank you guys so much
