This labor I've been doin' ain't got no reason or rhyme
And I can't hardly wait for it to finally be quittin' time
'Cause I've been pushin' steel through a run-down Rust Belt plant
And I can't wait to head on home so I can take my gal to dance
How I'll take my gal to dance
You know I'll take my gal to dance

[Verse 2]
The desert sure is hot and we've been workin' through the days
And I can't wait to get on home to my lovin' lady's gaze
A rifle in my hand and some brothers to my side
Well, I can't hardly wait for it to finally be quittin' time
Oh, I pray it'll be quittin' time
Oh, one day it'll be quittin' time

[Chorus]
Quittin' time's on my mind, but her kind eyes are on my heart
I've been sweatin' for my wages, but she'll cool me after dark
How she'll cool me after dark
You know she'll cool me after dark

[Bridge]
And I've been roofin' houses atop of homes I can't afford
So I'm savin' all my pennies and I'm prayin' to the Lord
One day we'll make it through all this barely gettin' by
I'm takin' out my woman and we're dancin' barefoot tonight

Quittin' time's on my mind, but her kind eyes are on my heart
I've been sweatin' for my wages, but she'll cool me after dark
How she'll cool me after dark
You know she'll cool me after dark

[Outro]
