Well, in you
The good I'll do, good I'll do, oh, good I'll do
Well, in you
I'm new, I'm new, oh, how I'm new

[Verse 1]
Way the grass smells at night and you got flames all in your eyes
They reflect the sparkler and you say we'll never die
Grab me by the hands, just as callused as I am and say you're proud

[Verse 2]
Well, it's blue jeans in the driveway and you're walkin' inside sideways
The wine always affects you in beautiful, kind ways
Ask me if I'm stayin' and I'll say that I'm sleepin' on the floor

[Verse 3]
Won't you tell me that you need me 'cause latеly I've been needin'
Someone to rеmind me, worth more than just an evenin'
I awoke to kitchen smoke, you dancin' like God's moved in you before

[Chorus]
'Cause in you
Good I'll do, good I'll do, oh, good I'll do

[Verse 4]
Look in my eyes, I don't wanna hide
I've been waitin' for you all damn night
Sundress I'll undress with nails on your skin turnin' white

Gettin' high out in Denver, drunk in Tennessee
I don't care where I am, long as you're with me
Them boys downtown talk so much shit when I leave

[Chorus]
Well, in you
The good I'll do, good I'll do, oh, good I'll do
Well, in you
I'm new, I'm new, oh, how I'm new

[Outro]
Thank you guys
This is a, uh, song I wrote a long time ago
We haven't played it or rehearsed it so we're gonna see how it goes
I haven't played it in a while
Thank you guys so much
