Take my soul, take my heart
Won't you tear me apart?
If I'm good for anything, it's all of this sufferin'
So use me for parts
To you, I'm just salvage
I ain't ran right in years
So drive me, then gut me, deceive, and fuck me
Then disappear
Well, steal all my jokes
Won't you tell them to them?
And act like you're someone that could be someone
Worth lovin'
Steal all the good parts
That you found in me
Yeah, you'll sell 'em quick, hell, you'll sell 'em chеap
Yeah, you'll give 'em for free
Wеll, I cleaned all my pistons
I'm runnin' on 91
And I'm piecin' myself back off the shelf
One by one
And now I've got a driver
Who chooses the high road
She don't use me for scraps or throw my ass back
When I hit potholes

And I'm flyin' down freeways
Goin' one-seventeen
And a '68 Fastback looks like a hatchback
Racin' me

[Bridge]
'Cause I believe
You cannot tear down what's built up strong now
Thankfully
Oh, I believe
You cannot tear down what's built up strong now
Thankfully

[Chorus]
And I'm flyin' down freeways
Goin' one-seventeen
And a '68 Fastback looks like a hatchback
Next to me

[Outro]
Everyone feelin' alright?
Okay, it's only fitting, I wrote a song a long time ago called "Snow"
You guys have beared through it
