Old friend, it's been awhile
I ain't spoke to you in years
And often times, boys from this town
Put wheels down and disappear
Ms. Cole asked about you just three days back
I had no answer to give her
Told her that you moved way out west
To write some songs and grow a little more bitter
Kids talk about you around here
Like you're some kind of legend
Wonder if they know a thousand sunrises ago
You were eager just like them

[Chorus]
If you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
Back to this side of Oklahoma City
Thеre'll be a porch light on from the post you lеaned on
'Fore you wound up on the wrong side of pity
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos?
Won't stay for long 'cause you won't stop your runnin'
Wait for tomorrow 'til tomorrow's not comin'

Heard you landed in Tulsa while he slipped away
Is that the reason you're fleein' fields we hauled hay?
Heat this July or the dark last December
Look in my eyes and you might remember
Weed out in Norman, the Stillwater strip
Run far enough, boy, and you're bound to trip

[Chorus]
If you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
Back to this side of Oklahoma City
Be a porch light on from the post you leaned on
'Fore you wound up on the wrong side of pity
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you or the fear of new hellos?
Won't stay for long 'cause you won't stop your runnin'
Wait for tomorrow 'til tomorrow's not comin'

[Chorus]
If you ever decide to bring your pain and your pride
Back to this side of Oklahoma City
Be a porch light on from the post you leaned on
'Fore you wound up on the wrong side of pity
And often times I pray for you and often times I don't
Is it the goodbyes that haunt you, fear of new hellos?
Won't stay for long 'cause you won't stop your runnin'
Wait for tomorrow 'til tomorrow's not comin'
[Outro]
It's pretty cold up here, my guitar went crazy outta tune, but we're still doin' it
Everyone feelin' okay?
Not freezin' too bad?
That's real nice
I'm so sorry we're havin' you guys bear through this this evenin'
