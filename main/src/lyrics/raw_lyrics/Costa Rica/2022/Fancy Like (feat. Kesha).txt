Kesha's here
Let's go, baby

[Verse 1: Walker Hayes]
Ayy
My girl is bangin', she's so low maintenance
Don't need no champagne-poppin' entertainment
Take her to Wendy's, can't keep her off me
She wanna dip me like them fries in her Frosty

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Walker Hayes & Kesha]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake
Get some whipped cream on thе top too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie likе Natty in the styrofoam
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Hey)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Walker Hayes & Kesha]
Ooh
Fancy like, ooh
Fancy like, ooh, yeah
Fancy like, ooh, yeah

[Verse 2: Kesha]
Oh, I don't need no Bentley to impress me (Woo)
I'll ride a bull into the party like a jet ski (That's right)
Boy, put that Dom down, take me to Waffle House (Hey)
Give me those cheap thrills, chillin' in the deep South

[Pre-Chorus: Walker Hayes & Kesha]
But every now and then, when I get paid
I gotta spoil my baby with an upgrade (Yeah)
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Walker Hayes & Kesha, Walker Hayes]
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (That's right)
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top too (Gotta add that whipped cream)
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you (Girl, I got you)
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Ayy)
That's how we do, how we do
[Bridge: Walker Hayes & Kesha]
Fancy like my new, clean blue jeans without the holes in 'em
Country kisses on my lips without the Skoal in 'em (Oh, we fancy like, ooh)
Yeah, she probably gon' be keepin' some Victoria's Secrets
Maybe a little Maybelline, but she don't need it (Oh, we fancy like, ooh)
In the kitchen light, radio slows down
Boxed wine and her up-do goes down

[Chorus: Walker Hayes, Kesha, Both]
Ayy
Yeah, we fancy like Applebee's on a date night (Date night)
Got that Bourbon Street steak with the Oreo shake (Ayy)
Get some whipped cream on the top too
Two straws, one check, girl, I got you
Bougie like Natty in the styrofoam (Styrofoam)
Squeaky-squeakin' in the truck bed all the way home (All the way home)
With some Alabama-jamma, she my Dixieland delight (Ayy)
That's how we do, how we do, fancy like
