Yâ€™all life, y'all
Hey

[Verse 1: Walker Hayes]
Small town, y'all town, double dutch in the park
Ice cream truck failing that emissions test hard
It's a blow up Grinch in the yard and it's March
Ain't comin' down anytime soon

[Verse 2: Walker Hayes]
Y'all, them nursing homes still rattling with some Dolly Parton
And them high school kids traveling like James Harden
In them white limousines to the Olive Garden
On prom night (Woo), it's good times, right

[Chorus: Walker Hayes with Ciara]
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all (Hey)
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how (Show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up (Up) and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow (Slow)
Said where the crawdads crawl (Ooh)
Said living that y'all life, y'all (Y'all life, y'all)
You might also like[Verse: Ciara]
Yah, yah
It ain't nothin' better than them Sunday night lights
Every night, baby, got me in my bag (Yah Yah)
If you ever disrespect the fam, baby
You know that's a flag
Throw it up, give me Jesus, football
That's that cup of life, hold up
Yah, yah, yeah, you know it's us
We the ones with all these brand-new blues
Sayin' "In God, we trust"
See, you try to copy my way
But you cannot do it my way
It don't matter how you try
I'ma be a Southern girl for the rest of my life

[Chorus: Walker Hayes & Ciara, (Walker Hayes)]
Livin' that y'all life, y'all rolling in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up, shawty, show 'em how (Show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up (Up) and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow (Real slow)
Said where the crawdads crawl
Said living that y'all life, y'all (Y'all life, y'all)
[Post-Chorus: Walker Hayes & Ciara]
(Oh)
If you're winners
Let me see you put your hands in the air
Break it down, ya'll, sing it

[Bridge: Walker Hayes with Ciara]
Said y'all, I got that Wiffle ball, bat flip swag in my walk
Down in 'Bama where they grammar got some country in it, y'all
'Nana puddin', prayer chains, tailgates in them jeans
Ain't no thang (Ain't no thang)
But a chicken wing, nah
(Ain't no thang but a chicken wing)

[Chorus: Walker Hayes & Ciara, (Walker Hayes)]
We be livin' that y'all life, y'all (Hey)
Rollin' in the South
Where it's all football and Jesus (Jesus)
Barbershop talking like nah
Shut your mouth, my mama's sweet tea's the sweetest
Turn that bass up (Up), shawty, show 'em how (Show 'em how)
Y'all, we raise up (Up) and, y'all, we goin' down, down, baby
Yo' street in my Bronco
I'ma talk to ya real slow (Real slow)
Said where the crawdads crawl
Said living that y'all life, y'all (Y'all life, y'all)
