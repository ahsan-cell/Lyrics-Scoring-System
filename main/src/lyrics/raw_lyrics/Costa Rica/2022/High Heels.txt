(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 1: Flo Rida]
I wake up like a billion dollars in the morning (Oh yeah)
I pick and choose from twenty cars on Mr. Foreigns (Zoom)
I'll take my whisky neat to hide my mixed emotions (My mixed emotions)
And they don't got a clue

[Chorus: Flo Rida]
My life is like parties over sleep
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams (Oh yeah)
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface, but I'm sinkin' underneath (Oh yeah)
You know my life is like

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
You know, lifе is priceless
Therе's pressure, but
I guess pressure make diamonds (Oh yeah)

[Verse 2: Walker Hayes]
You know my life is like
Giddy up, giddy up, family daddy
Almost got that Grammy
But I guess they don't do fancy like me, but I'm cool with it
I got low miles on my Prius
Rollin' down the row with Jesus
And my food at Applebee's is for free
I got this light and I'm lit like flash (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh god, I'm blessed (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I do my best, I do 'cause I got so much I could lose
And they don't got a clue (Aye)

Yeah, you know my life is like
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

[Bridge: Flo Rida & (Walker Hayes)]
You know my life is like a merry go round
The way I go round and around (Aye)
I hope that you know that I don't have me under control
Take me as I am

[Chorus: Flo Rida & Walker Hayes]
My life is like parties over sleep
Monkey in the middle of my money and my dreams (Oh yeah)
My life is like high heels on the beach
Perfect on the surface, but I'm sinkin' underneath (Oh yeah)
You know my life is like
