We were up too late
Smoking cigarettes at my place
And if we were still on MySpace
Then this would be my top 8, yeah, yeah
Sneaking liquor in the basement
You know my dad would never say shit
But we were skipping school
And breaking into swimming pools
Acting stupid when we wasted

[Pre-Chorus: Skeez]
Long nights in the suburbs
All grew up, moved out, what a bummer
If I could do it all again I would

[Chorus: Skeez]
This one’s for the homies
'Cause they really know me
And I’ll always come back
Whenevеr I’m lonely
So let’s pour another
For us and thе old me
'Cause I’m on the road now
But I miss the home team
Damn, I love my homies, oh
Yeah, I love my homies only, oh

Yeah, Uhyuready? (Yeah)
And you can’t spell homies without home
And there ain’t no me without 'em
I can’t even try to count the miles I’ve gone
To make something of myself to bring back home
And yeah, even though a lot of 'em
Are doing good and I'm proud of 'em
I hope they know, I got 'em, I know they know
I got the homies and a bottle
What more do I want?
I don’t need much more than this, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: mike. & Skeez]
Long nights in the summer
Ain’t had much, but we had each other
If I could do it all again I would

[Chorus: Skeez]
This one’s for the homies
'Cause they really know me
And I’ll always come back
Whenever I’m lonely
So let’s pour another
For us and the old me
'Cause I’m on the road now
But I miss the home team
Damn, I love my homies, oh
Yeah, I love my homies only, oh
[Outro: mike. & Skeez]
You can’t spell homies without home
And there ain’t no me without 'em
No cap
No kizzy
Uhyuready?
