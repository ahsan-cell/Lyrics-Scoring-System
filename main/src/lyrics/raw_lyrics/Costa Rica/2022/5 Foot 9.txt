Jack makes good whiskey, yeah
Red dirt makes good-riding roads
Country makes good music
For kicking up dust in a taillight glow
Dry wood makes good fires
Goodyears make good swings
All that's all good, but for me

[Chorus]
God makes five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, God makes the good stuff

[Verse 2]
Like that sweet little kiss she lays on me
When I pull up in the gravel drive
The way she dances with the raindrops
Like she's the reason why they fall from the sky
And I thank Him every time I close my eyes

[Chorus]
God makes five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff
You might also like[Bridge]
God made her, so I'ma make sure
He didn't waste an angel on me

[Chorus]
When He made five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff
Five-foot-nine, brown eyes in a sundress
Loves Tim McGraw and a small-town accent
Ain't no way that me and this truck made her fall in love
Jack makes good whiskey, but God makes the good stuff (Oh)

[Outro]
Yeah, God makes the good stuff
Yeah, God makes the good stuff (Oh)
Woah
