Red cups, sweaty bodies everywhere
Hands in the air like we don't care
'Cause we came to have so much fun now (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Bet somebody here might get some now
If you're not ready to go home
Can I get a "Hell no?" (Hell no)
We gonna go all night
'Til we see the sunlight, alright (Hey, hey, hey)

[Pre-Chorus]
So la-da-di-da-di, we like to party
Dancing with molly
Doing whatever we wanted
Ooh, this is our house, this is our rules

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Ooh, woah)
And we won't stop (Ooh, woah)
Can't you see it's we who own the night?
Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life?
We can't stop (Ooh, woah)
And we won't stop (Ooh, woah)
We run things, things don't run we
Don't take nothing from nobody, yeah, yeah

It's our song and I'll sing if we want to
It's my mouth, I'll say what I want to

[Verse 3]
With your feet on the air and your head on the ground
Try this trick and spin it, yeah
Your head will collapse, but there's nothing in it
So you ask yourself

[Chorus]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
[Verse 4]
Yeah, I was swimmin' in the Caribbean
Animals were hiding behind the rocks, yeah
Except the little fish
Who bumped into me, swear he was trying to talk, he said

[Chorus]
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Where is my mind?
Way out in the water, I see it swimmin'

[Chorus]
And we can't stop (Ooh, woah)
We won't stop (Ooh, woah)
