I tell you right here, if I was Shane McAnally, what I'd do
I'll tell you what I'd do, I'd put right here, I'd put
(Let's go)

[Verse 1: Walker Hayes]
I like beers cheap and cold
I like chairs that rock and fold
I like long cut wintergreen Skoal
And Redman's what I chew (Yeah, that's all, woo)
Got a yard full of car parts in it
I can dress you a hog in a minute
Yeah, my number one amendment (Which one?)
Is gonna have to be number two 'cause (Haha)

[Chorus: Walker Hayes]
I like shootin' ducks and bucks (Hey)
I like mud tires on my truck (Hey)
I like old blue jeans, guitar strings and dirt roads
(Everybody loves a dirt road) You know
I like girls that like the woods
I like kissin' 'еm on the hood
I like green tractors, Dukes of Hazzard and grits (Yеah)
You know (Here we go), country stuff

[Post-Chorus: Walker Hayes & Jake Owen]
Country stuff, country stuff
I like country stuff
Country stuff, country stuff
I like country stuff (Hey)
You might also like[Verse 2: Walker Hayes, Jake Owen & Both]
I sip whiskey from a handle (Handle)
I got dogs named Jack and Daniel
Yeah, my favorite shirts are flannel (Me too, man)
And I'll tear up some turnip greens (Ayy)
Now taxidermy, that's art
Favorite movie, you serious, Clark?
You know I love fishin' in the dark (Yeah)
The song and the real thing (Here we go)

[Chorus: Walker Hayes & Jake Owen]
I like shootin' ducks and bucks (Hey)
I like mud tires on my truck (Hey)
I like old blue jeans, guitar strings and dirt roads
(Everybody loves a dirt road) You know
I like girls that like the woods
I like kissin' 'em on the hood
I like green tractors, Dukes of Hazzard and grits (Yeah)
You know (Here we go), country stuff

[Post-Chorus: Both, Walker Hayes & Jake Owen]
Country stuff, country stuff (Cheese grits, man)
I like country stuff (Cheese grits?)
(Walker, my mom makes the best cheese grits you ever put in your mouth) Country stuff, country stuff
I like country stuff (Get you some)
[Bridge: Both, Walker Hayes & Jake Owen]
Alright, and I'm talkin' 'bout (What you talkin' 'bout?)
Tin roof rains, front porch swings
Back door, front door, both got screens
Callin' turkeys, beef jerky (That ain't no turkey call)
Sweet tea, y'all, it's all good

[Chorus: Walke Hayes, Both]
I like shootin' ducks and bucks
I like mud tires on my truck
I like old blue jeans, guitar strings and dirt roads
(Everybody loves a dirt road) You know
I like girls that like the woods
I like kissin' 'em on the hood
I like green tractors, Dukes of Hazzard and grits (Grits, yeah)
You know, country stuff

[Outro: Jake Owen & Walker Hayes]
Walker, grits does not rhyme with stuff
Well, man, I'm just tryna feed the kids
Just say it, man, just say what it is, you can say ****
You can't say that on the radio, man
You're a wuss, man1
