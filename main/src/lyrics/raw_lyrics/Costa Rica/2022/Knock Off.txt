I left you in a hurry
Ain't seen you since goodbye
You rolled up in this place with
A brand new blonde replacement
I had to look back twice

'Cause something 'bout her feels too familiar
Kinda like I'm looking in a mirror

You couldn't get the real thing so you got the knock off
But I bet she ain't got a kiss like mine
Yeah, she might be checking every lookalike box off
But there ain't a way to fake a one of a kind
It's like you traded top shelf for a cheap drink
Boy, I guess you couldn't get thе real thing
So you got the knock off
Ooh yeah, you got thе knock off

By now she's probably buying
All your recycled lines and
I used to buy them too

And I'm sure she's probably cool, she don't know she's being fooled
And you're only trying to fill my shoes
You might also likeYou couldn't get the real thing so you got the knock off
But I bet she ain't got a kiss like mine
Yeah, she might be checking every lookalike box off
But there ain't a way to fake a one of a kind
It's like you traded top shelf for a cheap drink
Boy, I guess you couldn't get the real thing
So you got the knock off
Ooh yeah, you got the knock off

Everybody in the whole bar sees
You're just tryna find another me

You couldn't get the real thing so you got the knock off
But I bet she ain't got a kiss like mine
Yeah, she might be checking every lookalike box off
But there ain't a way to fake a one of a kind
It's like you traded top shelf for a cheap drink
Boy, I guess you couldn't get the real thing
So you got the knock off
(So you got it)
Ooh yeah
(You got it)
You got the knock off
(So you got the knock off)
So you got the knock off
(So you got it)
Ooh yeah
(You got it)
You got the knock off
