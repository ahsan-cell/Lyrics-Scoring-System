I just don't care what
You have done in your life
Baby I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long
Please come by
I, I, I, I still believe in your eyes;
There is no choice
I belong to your life
Because I will live
To love you someday;
You'll be my baby
And we'll fly away
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

You are, are, are, are, are, are

Gonna be alright
And I'll fly with you
