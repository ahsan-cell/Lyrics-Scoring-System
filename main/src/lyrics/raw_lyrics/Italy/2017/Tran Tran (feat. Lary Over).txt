(Sfera, Lary Over, Lary)
Woo-oh-oh-ohh
Woo-oh-oh-ohh (Rvssian)
Woo-oh-oh-ohh (yeah)
Woo-oh-oh-ohh (Sharo Towers, Towers yeah yeah)
Woo-oh-oh-ohh (Carbon Fiber Music)
I've never asked ...

[Bridge: Sfera Ebbasta]
They ask, "How are you-you-you-you-you?"
They ask "How are you?", "How are you?", "How are you?"
But we never change no, never no, never
Here is always the usual routine
Yeah

[Verse 1: Sfera Ebbasta]
The S, the F, the E, the R, the A
Do not pretend anything
You heard about it in your city (hey)
I do not care about anything
Not in the rap, no
With that and with each other
No excuse, I do not speak your language
But sure you like your daughter
Sure, it's been a while in the trap
Icy necklaces, I have my heart in half
Already at my age
You can not talk about my contents, between, you are not old
What a beard, what a bore, what a sing-song
I know, they told you I do not sing well
But I've already told you: "I do not care"
Find a job and give a hand at home
Rather than asking for your mom's money
No, you've never seen your empty fridge
That's why you do not think about filling your stomach
Bad thoughts filled the room
Then with the efforts of a lifetime
Around Italy filling the premises
While these at home speak of Sfera
You might also like[Chorus: Sfera Ebbasta]
I never asked anyone anything
Never to anyone
No, I swear
Never to anyone
Within this tran, between
Big shot
Instead you are on a treadmill
Run on site
So run, run, run, run, run
Speak less, think of making many, many
Four in mate but now I do the accounts, counts
I open bank accounts, I become a count, with you
Woo-ohh-ohhh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ehi

[Verse 2: Lary Over]
They say they can, but they can not
They snore me of powers, but they do not have
I know that it is for me, from the day I left
I grew up in this, you never saw them
Throw me if you can
They say they can, but they can not
They snore me of powers, but they do not have
I know that it is for me, from the day I left
I grew up in this, you never saw them
Throw me if you can
I kill them like Michael Brown
Not if they spend they can see me
I can only understand
With me you can not fuck, yeah
It is spent exchanging everything there
I break them in the game like Ronaldo does
Here we throw and we never fail
That's why I have the haters sucking
And they throw me I do not see bullets
I do not miss Dybala
The haters slide me
Women praise me
With me nobody is going to fuck, no
We have the power (yeah)
[Chorus: Sfera Ebbasta]
I never asked anyone anything
Never to anyone
No, I swear
Never to anyone
Within this tran, between
Big shot
Instead you are on a treadmill
Run on site
So run, run, run, run, run
Speak less, think of making many, many
Four in mate but now I do the accounts, counts
I open bank accounts, I become a count, with you
Woo-ohh-ohhh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ooo-oh-oh-ohh
Ehi
