Labrinth, come in
Labrinth, come in
Labrinth, come in
Labrinth, come in

[Verse 1: Labrinth]
Ladies and gentlemen, this is something they call
A ground-breaker (Breaker)
So, let me first apologize to the shirts and the ties
For your make-up

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth]
'Cause I'll make you ugly, as soon as it drops
We're on a rampage, bottles poppin' off
Before you know it, there's rubble and dust
'Cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say, "You better run!"

[Chorus: Labrinth]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash something, yeah, mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here (So here we go, we go)

Ladies and gentleman, what you're about to witness
Is no illusion
And now, we got the bass banging from here to Buckingham Palace
They're all moving

[Pre-Chorus 2: Labrinth]
Hey Simon, we're fuckin' them up
Turnin' them SyCo, everybody rock
Let's bring the house down to rubble and dust
'Cause we'll be fuckin' it up
Somebody say, "You better run!"

[Chorus: Labrinth, Tinie Tempah]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it (Yeah), throw bombs on it (Yeah)
Just smash something, yeah, mosh for me (Aha)
Yeah! (Let's go)
We can make an earthquake up in here (So here we go, we go)

[Break: Labrinth, Tinie Tempah]
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, yeah
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
Just smash somethin', yes, mosh for me
Hey, yes
We can make an earthquake up in here (So here we go, we go)
[Interlude: Tinie Tempah]
Hey, yo, Labrinth
This one's feeling like a straight ten on the Richter scale, ya know?

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah
Fire, fire, we about to set this place on fire
Without a match or lighter
Don't do girlfriends, one-nighters
Make them (Ahh), C-minor
If I want Christian or Kurt Geiger, I just phone up their designer
Doing all-nighters, no days off
Gray hairs and a little bit of weight loss
I predict (Riots)
I predict (Chaos)
I predict (People)
I predict (Oh)
Disturbing London, got the whole city panickin'
I be Nostradamus, this my ni-ni-nigga, Labrinth

[Chorus: Labrinth, Tinie Tempah]
Yeah!
I predict an earthquake up in here
Say, "Yeah!"
I predict an earthquake up in here
'Cause we throw bombs on it (Yeah), throw bombs on it (Yeah)
Just smash something, yeah, mosh for me
Hey, yeah!
We can make an earthquake up in here (So here we go, we go)
