Antidote
There's no antidote
Don't stop, turn that up, take it higher
Take this mother up, start a riot
Don't stop, turn that up, take it higher
Take this mother up, start a riot

[Verse]
There's a glitch inside my system
Rushin' through my whole existence
Got me twisted, can't resist this
Somethin's flippin' all my switches
Take 'em, break 'em, make 'em feel it
Mix it up and mass-appeal it
Pressure is ridin' me hard
Killer dose right to my heart

[Chorus]
And there's no antidote
And there's no antidote
And there's no antidote
And there's no antidote
There's no antidote

[Verse]
There's a glitch inside my system
Rushin' through my whole existence
Got me twisted, can't resist this
Somethin's flippin' all my switches
Take 'em, break 'em, make 'em feel it
Mix it up and mass-appeal it
Pressure is ridin' me hard
Killer dose right to my heart

And there's no antidote (Antidote)
And there's no antidote (Antidote)
And there's no antidote (Antidote)
And there's no antidote (Antidote)4
