Oh, daddy
You know you make me cry
How can you love me
I don't understand why

[Refrain: Christine McVie]
Oh, daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Oh, daddy
You soothe me with your smile
You're letting me know
You're the best thing in my life

[Refrain: Christine McVie]
Oh, daddy
If I can make you see
If there's been a fool around
It's got to be me
Yes, it's got to be me

And I can't walk away from you
Baby, if I tried
