So cool, calm and collected
You had a style, a rakish style
Well, my poor heart never connected
You'd stay so long on my mind

[Chorus: Christine McVie & Lindsey Buckingham]
Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl

[Verse 2: Christine McVie]
Looking back, so long ago
You had a knack, a knack of making women know
Ooh, there wasn't the time
And I knew you'd never be mine

[Chorus: Christine McVie & Lindsey Buckingham]
Well, isn't it midnight on the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?

[Chorus: Christine McVie & Lindsey Buckingham]
Isn't it midnight on the other side of the world?
Do you remember
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl?
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
The face of a pretty girl
