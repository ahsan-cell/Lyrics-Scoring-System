Instead of hurting back, you said, "I love you..."
And every day, you won my heart
And my love for you shall never part...

You have such an understanding way
And I appreciate you, believe what I say
'Cause a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking
Knock, knocking every day...
No, a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking
Knock, knocking every day...

It's the little things you do that mean so much, so very much;
(Consideration) I never knew
That is, until I met you... believe me, baby;
You made my life complete
And I know I'm gonna love you all my life;
You can believe me - I'm gonna hold on tight!
'Cause a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking
Knock, knocking every day...
No, a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking every day...
No, darling... not every day...

I said a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking
Knock, knocking every day...
No, a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking
Knock, knocking every day... Come on, chile!
No, a love like yours don't come knock, knock, knock, knocking
Knock, knocking every day...You might also like
