I've been alone
All the years
So many ways to count the tears
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die

[Verse 2]
I been alone
Always down
No one cared to stay around
I never change
I never will
I'm so afraid the way I feel

[Chorus]
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die
You might also likeHow I feel
Days when the rain and the sun are gone
Black as night
Agony's torn at my heart too long
So afraid
Slip and I fall and I die6
