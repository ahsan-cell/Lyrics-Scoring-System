Except the fires from which I came
Like parted souls, divided for an age, awe and wonder I'd embrace
And the world anew again
But now, this picture from me fades
From still's cold hand, there's no reprieve, light the fire in me
Shine, shine your light on me
Illuminate me, make me complete
Lay me down, and wash this world from me
Open the skies, and burn it all away
Cause I've been waiting, all my life just waiting
For you to shine, shine your light on me
I dreamed the world, with my eyes open
But time moved on and then, new worlds begin again
Oh my heart, in this universe so vast
No moment was made to last, so light the fire in me
Shine, shine your light on me
Illuminate me, make me complete
Please shine, shine your light on me
No hesitation, make me complete
Lay me down, and wash this world from me
Open the skies, and burn it all away
Cause I've been waiting, all my life just waiting
For you to shine, shine your light on meSee VNV Nation LiveGet tickets as low as $49You might also like1
