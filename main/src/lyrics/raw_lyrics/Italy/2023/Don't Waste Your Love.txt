Don't waste, your love
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, your love

[Verse 1]
Don't waste your love on me
That's what she said
I'm gonna be the one
You will regret
Don't play your tricks on me
Your not that smart
I'm gonna bring you down
And break your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Find yourself
Somebody better
Somebody who's saner
And crazy for you
It's too late
I'm too broken
Why won't you listen
When I say
Don't waste your love
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't waste your love
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't wastе your love, love
Don't waste your lovе on me, no
Don't waste your love
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't waste your love
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, your love
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, your love

[Verse 2]
I'm not afraid of you
I tried to lie
Well then you oughta be
Was your reply
You think I'm gonna change
I never have
And I going to?
Don't make me laugh
[Pre-Chorus]
Walk away
This isn't worth it
There's no happy ending
Or even a start
Stick around
And I'll hurt you
Why won't you listen
When I say
Don't waste your love

[Chorus]
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't waste your love
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't waste your love, love
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't waste your love
Don't waste your love on me, no
Don't waste your love
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, your love
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, waste, waste
Don't waste, your love
