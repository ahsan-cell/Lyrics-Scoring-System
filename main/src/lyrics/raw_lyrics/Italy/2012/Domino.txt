I'm feelin' sexy and free
Like glitter's rainin' on me
You're like a shot of pure gold
I think I'm 'bout to explode

[Refrain]
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathin' like I'm runnin' 'cause you're takin' me there
Don't you know?
You spin me out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Boom me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me losin' my mind
My heart beats out of time
I'm seein' Hollywood stars
You strum me like a guitar

[Refrain]
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air
Now I'm breathin' like I'm runnin' 'cause you're takin' me there
Don't you know?
You spin me out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
We can do this all night
Damn, this love is skin tight
Baby, come on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Boom me like a bass drum
Sparkin' up a rhythm
Baby, come on
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
[Bridge]
Ooh baby, baby, got me feelin' so right
Ooh baby, baby, dancin' in the moonlight
Ooh baby, baby, got me feelin' so right

Rock my world until the sunlight
Make this dream the best I've ever known
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch, don't ever let me go
Dirty dancin' in the moonlight (In the moonlight)
Take me down like I'm a domino21
