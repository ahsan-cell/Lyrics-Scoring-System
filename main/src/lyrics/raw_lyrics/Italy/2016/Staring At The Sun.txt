Watch the sunset, hold it from afar
Close as I get to being where you are
While there's light left, I sing this song for you
Don't know if you care, but every day, I do

[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand, staring at the sun
Distant land, staring at the sun
You're not there, but we share the same one
Miles apart, staring at the sun
Distant town, staring at the sun
One thing's true just like you
There's only one

[Chorus]
And I don't care if it burns my eyes
And I don't care cause my love is blind
From staring at the sun, oh oh
From staring at the sun
From staring at the sun, oh oh
From staring at the sun

[Verse 2]
Send my love down in those rays of light
Through your window on your tired eyes
Say good morning, say it to the sun
Like you're talking, talking to someone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Here I stand, staring at the sun
Distant land, staring at the sun
You're not there, but we share the same one
Miles apart, staring at the sun
Distant town, staring at the sun
One thing's true just like you
There's only one

[Chorus]
And I don't care if it burns my eyes
And I don't care cause my love is blind
From staring at the sun, oh oh
From staring at the sun
From staring at the sun, oh oh
From staring at the sun6
