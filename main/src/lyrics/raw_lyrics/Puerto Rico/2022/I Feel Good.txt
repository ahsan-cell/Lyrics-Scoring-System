It feels good to see
The world getting loose (Mr. Worldwide)
Feels good to see
The world getting loose (Let's ride)
I don't know about you (Sak Noel)
I don't know about you (Phenom)
I don't know about you (White Shadow)
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm two plus two, I'm fo' sho
You down, I'm down, baby let's go
You stop, you drop, baby, then roll
You twerk, you pop, booty so swole
I'd hate me too if I were you
And when it comes to billions, I'll take two
It's only one life, you don't get two
So live life, don't let it live you

[Refrain: Anthony Watts]
I got a pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Put on a jacket 'cause these diamonds give you chills
Two shots, I'm running
Two and I'm stunning tonight, tonight (Yeah)
Look in the mirror, I'm like who the hell is hе?
So many whips and cribs, I'm losing track of keys
Ooh, up to something
Ooh yeah, I lovе it alright, alright

Yeah-yeah, I'm drinking out the bottle (Get loose)
Hanging with supermodels (Get loose)
Feel like I've hit the lotto

[Chorus: Pitbull]
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
I'm one plus one, I'm too strong
If you ain't about money then get gone
I wanna wild out all night long
You wanna ride out, then get on
I'd hate me too if I were you
And when it comes to billions, I'll take two
It's only one life, you don't get two
So live life, don't let it live you

[Refrain: Anthony Watts]
I got a pocket full of hundred dollar bills
Put on a jacket 'cause these diamonds give you chills
Two shots, I'm running
Two and I'm stunning tonight, I'm stunning tonight, yeah
Look in the mirror I'm like who the hell is he? (who the hell is he?)
So many whips and cribs, I'm losing track of keys
Ooh, up to something
Ooh yeah, I love it alright, alright
[Pre-Chorus: Pitbull]
Yeah-yeah, I'm drinking out the bottle (Get loose)
Hanging with supermodels (Get loose)
Feel like I've hit the lotto

[Chorus: Pitbull]
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good
I don't know about you, but I feel good1
