Mr. Worldwide to infinity
You know the roof on fire
We gon' boogie, oogie-oggie, jiggle, wiggle and dance
Like the roof on fire
We gon' drink drinks and take shots until we fall out
Like the roof on fire
Now, baby, give a booty naked, take off all your clothes
And light the roof on fire
Tell her, tell her, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fire"
I tell her, "Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm on fireball"

I saw, I came, I conquered
Or should I say, "I saw, I conquered, I came" (Ha-ha)
They say the chico on fire and he no liar
While y'all slippin’ he runnin’ the game
Now big bang boogie, get that kitty little noogie
In a nice, nice little shade
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said “Walk this way”

I was born in a flame
Momma said that everyone would know my name
I'm the best (That's right),  you've ever had (That's right)
If you think I'm burning out, I never am (Yeah)
I'm on fire (Come here)
I'm on fire (Come here)
I'm on fire (Come here)

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I don’t care what y'all say
'Cause as the world turns, y’all boys gonna learn
That chico right here don't play (Ha-ha)
That boy’s from the bottom, bottom of the map
M.I.A U.S.A
I gave Suzie a little pat up on the booty
And she turned around and said, “Walk this way”
