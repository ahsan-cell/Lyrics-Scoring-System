This world is broken

[Intro]
I know that we're only elements
Imbalancing, go put the mirror down
We give everything just to seem innocent
Negative energy consumes
Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe
Hysteria
The consequence of fear
Hysteria
There's no way out of here

[Verse 1]
I'm so over this, I wanna snuff the wick, I'm fucking done with it
Ask no question, hear no lies

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is just a gateway drug
But what's left in it for us?
It goes like

[Chorus]
I don't want it just 'cause you have it
I don't want it, fuck, you're systematic
I don't want it just 'cause you have it, no doubt about it
I don't want your bullshit, fuck, you're systematic

I'm shook
Never should've given a fuck, we're just giving it up like it's dead to us
I'm shook
Bend the lie, it will all be over soon enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is just a gateway drug
It's unconditional lust
It goes like

[Chorus]
I don't want it just 'cause you have it
I don't want it, fuck, you're systematic
I don't want it just 'cause you have it, no doubt about it
I don't want your bullshit, fuck, you're systematic

[Bridge] [Rou Reynolds Feature]
Yes, solid
I'm so over this
Over-exposed to the abyss
This system got me by the wrist
I wish it would cease and desist
Fuck your glamour and glitz
We're miners down the mosh pits
Manic faith in community
Take a new opportunity
Or you'll get systematically torn down
You'll wish you weren't born now
You just want to leave, how
Never gonna escape, they can't allow
Hysteria
The consequence of fear
Hysteria
There's no way out of here

Oi
Follow the rules it's methodical
The industry's standards so comical
I told you that everything's possible
I told you that everything's possible

I know that we're only elements
Imbalancing, go put the mirror down
We give everything just to seem innocent
Negative energy consumes

You're systematically torn down
Systematically torn down
I'm so over this
Never give up, never give in
Never gonna let the negative energy win
What?
Never give up, never give in
Never let the negative consume

[Outro]
I'm so over this
I'm so over this
I'm so over this
[Spoken]
Fucked
