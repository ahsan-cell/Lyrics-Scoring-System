This ain't another love song, baby
It's my way of putting feelers out
All the traffic in my head's going crazy
I'm gonna trust my heart right now
And if it's better to bet on us, then I'll double down
And if we end up in bed and I put the covers out
And if I'm wrong, I'll just bury my head deep underground
I gotta know

[Chorus]
Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)
If so, then I think I know what's (Know what's) going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no

[Verse 2]
Everybody in this club so faded
I'm trippin' over getting lost on you
If we forever startеd out as strangers
I think my ever aftеr just came true
If you could see what I see, then let's see what it's about
We will go higher and higher, but we're not looking down
If it's a dream, there's no telling when I'll be coming 'round
And I gotta know
You might also like[Chorus]
Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)
If so, then I think I know what's (Know what's) going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no

[Bridge]
Something about you
Do you feel the way I do?
There's magic in the room
Tell me, do you feel it too?
Something about you
Do you feel the way I do?
There's magic in the room
Tell me what we gonna do?

[Chorus]
Are you feeling the rush?
If so, then I think I know what's going on
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Are you thinking 'bout us? ('Bout us)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
If so, then I think I know (Know what's) what's going on
(What's going on)
And are we falling in love?
Say yes or no, yes or no, yes or no
Oh-oh, mmm6
