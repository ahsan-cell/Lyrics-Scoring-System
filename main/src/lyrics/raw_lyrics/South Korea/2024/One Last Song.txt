Strong coffee mornings, sad realization
The story went as I predicted
But you won't admit that
Sage by the driveway
Freezing hands tucked in my shirt
’Cause there's "no obligation" to make a confession

[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, I won't take you with me
Oooh, I don’t make you happy

[Chorus]
'Cause i write songs by the kitchen radiator
In the dark with Cohen when the rain makes your head hurt
And I wish that I could see the past for all it truly was
When I say I'll write you one last song but
That never works

[Verse 2]
Magnets and postcards that we stuck on the fridge
To remind us of love when it gets rough
But you simply walked out
Drawing in the fog of your Awning windows
Shapes into my brain I can never unknow
Every fleeting touch now a memory for life
And that's alright 'cause
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oooh, I won't take you with me
Oooh, I don't make you happy

[Chorus]
'Cause i write songs by the kitchen radiator
In the dark with Cohen when the rain makes your head hurt
And I wish that I could see the past for all it truly was
When I say I’ll write you one last song but
That never works

[Bridge]
Suburban dreams fade into nothing
The plot unfolds and I had it coming
I caught it

[Verse 3]
Slow drives, cobblestone
Nights on your shoulder
Then I miss your house more than I need closure
And I wish that i could see us both for all that we once were
When I say I’ll write you one last love song

[Chorus]
'Cause i write songs by the kitchen radiator
In the dark with Cohen when the rain makes your head hurt
And I wish that I could see the past for all it truly was
When I say I’ll write you one last song but
That never works
