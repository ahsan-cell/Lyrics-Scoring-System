Fact 1: By not later than 20 weeks after fertilization, pain receptors (nociceptors) are present throughout an unborn child's entire body, and nerves link these receptors to the brain's thalamus and subcortical plate by not later than 20 weeks.

1. Myers, 2004, p.241, para. 2, “The first essential requirement for nociception is the presence of sensory receptors, which first develop in the perioral area at approximately 7 weeks gestation and are diffusely located throughout the body by 14 weeks.95”

2. Derbyshire, 2010, p.7, para.2, “For the foetus, an existence of ‘pain’ rests upon the existence of a stimulus that poses a threat to tissue, being detected by a nervous system capable of preferentially responding to stimuli that pose a threat to tissue. The entire experience is completely bounded by the limits of the sensory system and the relationship between that system and the stimulus. If pain is conceived of in this manner then it becomes possible to talk of foetal pain anytime between 10 and 17 weeks GA [gestational age] when nociceptors develop and mature, and there is evidence of behavioural responses to touch.”

This puts an early limit on when it is likely that the fetus might be aware of anything that is going on in its body or elsewhere.”

These afferents appear morphologically mature enough to synapse with subplate neurons.17”

9. Van de Velde, 2012, p 206, para.3, “To experience pain an intact system of pain transmission from the peripheral receptor to the cerebral cortex must be available. Peripheral receptors develop from the seventh gestational week. From 20 weeks’ gestation [= 20 weeks post-fertilization] peripheral receptors are present on the whole body. From 13 weeks’ gestation the afferent system located in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord starts developing. Development of afferent fibers connecting peripheral receptors with the dorsal horn starts at 8 weeks’ gestation. Spinothalamic connections start to develop from 14 weeks’ and are complete at 20 weeks’ gestation, whilst thalamocortical connections are present from 17 weeks’ and completely developed at 26–30 weeks’ gestation. From 16 weeks’ gestation pain transmission from a peripheral receptor to the cortex is possible and completely developed from 26 weeks’ gestation.”

Fact 2: By eight weeks after fertilization, an unborn child reacts to touch.

1. Myers 2004, p.241, para.6, “A motor response can first be seen as a whole body movement away from a stimulus and observed on ultrasound from as early as 7.5 weeks’ gestational age. The perioral area is the first part of the body to respond to touch at approximately 8 weeks, but by 14 weeks most of the body is responsive to touch.”

2. Derbyshire, 2008, p.119, col.2, para.4, “Responses to touch begin at 7–8 weeks gestation when touching the peri-oral region results in a contralateral bending of the head. The palms of the hands become sensitive to stroking at 10-11 weeks gestation and the rest of the body becomes sensitive around 13-14 weeks gestation.35”
Note: Derbyshire’s other published works indicate that he believes pain requires subjective human experience, not possible until after birth; nonetheless, he acknowledges this finding.

Fact 3: After 20 weeks after fertilization, an unborn child reacts, with responses such as recoiling, to stimuli that would be recognized as painful if experienced by an adult human.

Fact 4: In an unborn child, application of painful stimuli is associated with significant increases in stress hormones, a reaction known as the "stress response."

2. Myers, 2004, p.242, para.2, “Human fetal endocrine responses to stress have been demonstrated from as early as 18 weeks’ gestation. Giannakoulopoulos et al99 first demonstrated increases in fetal plasma concentrations of cortisol and β-endorphin in response to prolonged needling of the intrahepatic vein (IHV) for intrauterine transfusion. The magnitude of these stress responses directly correlated with the duration of the procedure. Fetuses having the same procedure of transfusion, but via the non-innervated placental cord insertion, failed to show these hormonal responses. Gitau et al100 observed a rise in β-endorphin during intrahepatic transfusion from 18 weeks’ gestation, which was seen throughout pregnancy independent both of gestation and the maternal response. The fetal cortisol response, again independent of the mother’s, was observed from 20 weeks’ gestation.100 Fetal intravenous administration of the opioid receptor agonist, fentanyl, ablated the β-endorphin response and partially ablated the cortisol response to the stress of IHV needling, suggesting an analgesic effect.101 A similar, but faster, response is seen in fetal production of noradrenalin to IHV needling. This too is observed in fetuses as early as 18 weeks, is independent to the maternal response and increases to some extent with gestational age.102 Thus, from these studies one can conclude that the human fetal hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal axis is functionally mature enough to produce a β-endorphin response by 18 weeks and to produce cortisol and noradrenalin responses from 20 weeks’ gestation.”

Fact 5: Subjection of an unborn child to painful stimuli is associated with long-term harmful neurodevelopmental effects, such as altered pain sensitivity and, possibly, emotional, behavioral, and learning disabilities later in life.

1. Van de Velde, 2006, p.234, col.1, para.3, “It is becoming increasingly clear that experiences of pain will be ‘remembered’ by the developing nervous system, perhaps for the entire life of the individual.22,33 These findings should focus the attention of clinicians on the long-term impact of early painful experiences, and highlight the urgent need for developing therapeutic strategies for the management of neonatal and fetal pain.”

Note: Vanhalto & Niewenhuizen believe that pain requires cortical processing; nevertheless, they acknowledge that, “noxious stimuli may have adverse effects on the developing individual regardless of the quality or the level of processing in the brain…after the development of the spinal cord afferents around the gestational week 10, there may be no age limit at which one can be sure noxae are harmless.” (p.149, col.1, para.2).

6. Kadić, 2012, page 4, “Further, experts from different fields of science debate whether the fetus feels pain. However, despite the great interest in conscious experience and memory of pain, unconscious reactions such as the secretion of stress hormones and their far-reaching detrimental effect, are probably more dangerous for the development of the fetus than terrifying memories.”

Fact 6: For the purposes of surgery on unborn children, fetal anesthesia is routinely administered and is associated with a decrease in stress hormones compared to the level of stress hormones present when painful stimuli are applied without fetal anesthesia.

1. Giuntini, 2007, “It has also been shown that fetuses feel pain from week 18. This has given rise to the practice of using fetal anesthesia for surgery or invasive diagnostic procedures in utero.”

p.240, col.5, “A substantial amount of both animal and human research demonstrated that the fetus is able to mount a substantial neuroendocrine response to noxious stimuli as early as the second trimester of pregnancy. Fetal neuroanatomical development further substantiates this research. Evidence also exists that suggests that these responses to noxious stimuli may, in fact, alter the response to subsequent noxious stimuli long after the initial insult. This is the rationale behind providing fetal anaesthesia and analgesia whenever surgical intervention is thought to potentially provide a noxious insult to the fetus.”

Abstract, “The authors investigated whether fentanyl ablates the fetal stress response to needling using the model of delayed interval sampling during intrahepatic vein blood sampling and transfusion in alloimmunized fetuses undergoing intravascular transfusion between 20 and 35 weeks.
“Fentanyl reduced the β endorphin (mean difference in changes, -70.3 pg/ml; 95% confidence interval, -121 to -19.2;P = 0.02) and middle cerebral artery pulsatility index response (mean difference, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-1.04;P = 0.03), but not the cortisol response (mean difference, -10.9 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval, -24.7 to 2.9;P = 0.11) in fetuses who had paired intrahepatic vein transfusions with and without fentanyl. Comparison with control fetuses transfused without fentanyl indicated that the β endorphin and cerebral Doppler response to intrahepatic vein transfusion with fentanyl approached that of nonstressful placental cord transfusions.
“Conclusions: The authors conclude that intravenous fentanyl attenuates the fetal stress response to intrahepatic vein needling.”

11. Derbyshire, 2008, p.119, col.2, para.1-2, “Anand’s seminal work with neonates undergoing surgery demonstrated that fentanyl added to the anaesthetic regimen significantly reduces the stress response to invasive practice.4 Specifically, plasma adrenalin, noradrenaline, glucagon, aldosterone, corticosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels were significantly increased in the nonfentanyl group up to 24 hours after surgery. Reducing the normal stress response was considered to be responsible for the improved clinical outcome of the fentanyl group who required less post-surgical ventilator support and had reduced circulatory and metabolic complications.
“More recently, the stress response to invasive practice has been examined in the fetus to demonstrate increased cortisol and h-endorphin circulation following intrauterine needling of the fetus beyond 18 weeks gestation.25 Further studies have demonstrated that the fetal stress response includes haemodynamic changes in blood flow to protect essential organs, such as the brain, and blunting the stress response when providing opioid analgesia to the fetus.26,27”
Note: Derbyshire believes pain requires subjective human experience, not
possible until after birth; nonetheless, he acknowledges this finding.

Fact 7: The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child is incapable of experiencing pain until a point later in pregnancy than 20 weeks after fertilization predominately rests on the assumption that the ability to experience pain depends on the cerebral cortex and requires nerve connections between the thalamus and the cortex, but the majority of medical research and analysis, especially research and analysis completed since 2007, indicates that a functioning cortex is not necessary to experience pain.

1. Lee, 2005, Abstract, para.3, “Pain perception requires conscious recognition or awareness of a noxious stimulus. Neither withdrawal reflexes nor hormonal stress response to invasive procedures prove the existence of fetal pain, because they can be elicited by nonpainful stimuli and occur without conscious cortical processing. Fetal awareness of noxious stimuli requires functional thalamocortical connections. Thalamocortical fibers begin appearing between 23 to 30 weeks’ gestational age, while eletroencephalography suggests the capacity for functional pain perception in preterm neonates probably does not exist before 29 or 30 weeks.”

6. Brusseau, 2008, p.16, para.1, “However, if one were to argue that a minimal form of consciousness might be possible without cortical involvement, then certainly one would have to consider thalamic development as a benchmark for the possible generation of such a state. As described above, thalamic structures seem to be in place somewhere between 20 and 30 weeks… Other evidence, however, points to a much earlier maturation of thalamic processing function. Thalamic connections are intimately involved in the generation of the physiochemical and endocrine responses to nociception that are seen as early as 18 weeks.20,27”
p.20, para.3, “Perhaps the subcortex is necessary and sufficient for at least a minimal, Hameroffian consciousness, one that (if the data regarding anencephalic children are to be believed) may render an integrated experience of nociception that we might call pain.”

Fact 8: Substantial evidence indicates that children born missing the bulk of the cerebral cortex, such as children with hydranencephaly, experience pain.

1. Brusseau, 2008, p.17, para. 2-3, “Clinical evidence for conscious perception mediated by such a subcortical system comes from infants and children with hydranencephaly…31-33. Despite the total or near-total absence of cerebral cortex, these children clearly demonstrate elements of consciousness.34… It is important to note that these are not hydrocephalic children who possess a thin rim of intact, functional cortex, but rather children with little or no cortex at all…what little cortex may remain is generally nonfunctional and without normal white matter connectivity.35
“As such, it would seem these children demonstrate that anatomic development or functional activity of the cortex may not be required for conscious sensory perception. They may, and do in fact, respond to painful or pleasurable stimuli in what may easily be argued to be a conscious, coordinated manner, similar to intact children.36”

Infants and children with hydranencephaly, despite total or near-total absence of the cortex, clearly possess discriminative awareness58,59: they discriminate familiar from unfamiliar people and environments and are capable of social interaction, visual orienting, musical preferences, appropriate affective responses, and associative learning56. Several stimuli are processed without the need of the cortex 51,52,57 and give useful visual information 58,59 or trigger complex experiences such as fear 53,60.

Fact 9: In adults, stimulation or ablation of the cerebral cortex does not alter pain perception, while stimulation or ablation of the thalamus does alter pain perception.

1. Brusseau, 2008, p.16, para.3, “In keeping with the critical insights of Penfield and Jasper, clinical evidence suggests that either ablation or stimulation of the primary somatosensory cortex does not alter pain perception in adults (demonstrated by Penfield and Jasper themselves), whereas both thalamic ablation and stimulation have been shown to interrupt pain perception.”
p.17, para.1 “In keeping with this evidence, we should consider that if cortical activity is not a prerequisite for pain perception in adults, then by analogy neither would it be a necessary criterion for fetuses.”
Note: Brusseau is ultimately agnostic regarding the ability of unborn children to feel pain before 28 weeks.

2. Merker, 2007, p.65, col.1, para.3, “Penfield and Jasper note that cortical removal even as radical as hemispherectomy does not deprive a patient of consciousness, but rather of certain forms of information, discrimination capacities, or abilities, but not of consciousness itself… What impressed Penfield and Jasper was the extent to which the cerebral cortex could be subjected to acute insult without producing so much as an interruption in the continuity of consciousness. Their opinion in this regard bears some weight, in that their magnum opus of 1954 – Epilepsy and the Functional Anatomy of the Human Brain –summarizes and evaluates experience with 750 such operations.”

Fact 10: Substantial evidence shows that structures used for pain processing in early development differ from those of adults, using different neural elements available at specific times during development, such as the subcortical plate, to fulfill the role of pain processing.

4. White, 2004, p.208, para.4, “The anatomical evidence shows that the nociceptive connections of the fetus are not merely immature versions of the adult but are structurally different and these differences confer differences in function. Furthermore, interference with the natural progression to adult-like status can have extensive effects. Nerve section of afferent pathways, from the forelimb in the rat during early development, results in major changes in the subsequent central connections and sensory perception from other sites.40Clearly this has implications for any form of fetal surgery.”

6. O’Donnell, 2008, page 60, “Lee et al.15 have stated that the capacity “for conscious perception of pain can arise only after thalamocortical pathways begin to function, which may occur in the third trimester around 29-30 weeks’ gestational age.” As discussed above, given the limitations of our current knowledge, this is unduly definite. Pain perception in the fetus may not use the same pathways as in the human adult, just as it may not in other species, such as the octopus10. Many fetal structures are different from those in the adult, and may function in a different way. We do not know that in the fetus thalamocortical pathways are essential for any perception of pain. Connections from the thalamus to the subplate zone may be sufficient, for example. If Lee et al.’s reasoning were correct, it would imply that the majority of premature babies in intensive care do not feel pain either.”

Fact 11: The position, asserted by some medical experts, that the unborn child remains in a "coma-like sleep state" that precludes the unborn child experiencing pain is inconsistent with the documented reaction of unborn children to painful stimuli and with the experience of fetal surgeons who typically sedate the unborn child with anesthesia to prevent the unborn child from rapidly moving in reaction to invasive surgery.

1. Fitzgerald, 2005, p.513, col.1, para.2, “Despite the existence of sensory reflexes from the first trimester of human fetal life, it is unlikely that the fetus is ever awake or aware and, therefore, able to truly experience pain, due to high levels of endogenous neuroinhibitors, such as adenosine and pregnanolone, which are produced in the feto-placental unit and contribute to fetal sleep states144. In preterm infants below 32 weeks most pain responses, including facial expressions, seem to be largely subcortical145.”

2. Mellor, 2005, p.464, col.2, para.4, “We conclude that there is currently no strong evidence to suggest that the fetus is ever awake, even transiently; rather, it is actively kept asleep (and unconscious) by a variety of endogenous inhibitory factors. Thus, despite the presence of intact nociceptive pathways from around mid-gestation, the critical aspect of cortical awareness in the process of pain perception is missing.”

Fact 12: Consequently, substantial medical evidence recognizes that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by not later than 20 weeks after fertilization.

1. Glover, 1999, p.885, col.1, para.3, “Given the anatomical evidence, it is possible that the fetus can feel pain from 20 weeks and is caused distress by interventions from as early as 15 or 16 weeks.”

4. Van de Velde, 2012, pages 201-209, “To experience pain an intact system of pain transmission from the peripheral receptor to the cerebral cortex must be available. Peripheral receptors develop from the seventh gestational week. From 20 weeks’ gestation peripheral receptors are present on the whole body. From 13 weeks’ gestation the afferent system located in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord starts developing. Development of afferent fibers connecting peripheral receptors with the dorsal horn starts at 8 weeks’ gestation. Spinothalamic connections start to develop from 14 weeks’ and are complete at 20 weeks’ gestation, whilst thalamocortical connections are present from 17 weeks’ and completely developed at 26–30 weeks’ gestation. From 16 weeks’ gestation pain transmission from a peripheral receptor to the cortex is possible and completely developed from 26 weeks’ gestation.
