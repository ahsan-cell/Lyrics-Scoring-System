Yo, coming in with a sound fresher than cut grass
(Fun starts) Second that we enter if you must ask
(Rush past) Like you've forgotten your mind
All the drivers all up our face like "Can I see your bus pass?"
Like, nah
We just wanna lickle ride, bruv
Call me what you want but you should not call it a night, love
And I might just join the mile high club
Only problem being that I couldn't give a flying f**k!
Yeah, lemme touch back down
I'ma slap her on the bum
Until it comes back 'round
Half the room's like, "Oi, what's this all about?"
With the other half jivin'
I love that sound
Ah yeah yeah, I love that sound, what
Ah yeah yeah, I love that sound, uh
So flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
Yeah your mama can hump

[Chorus]
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump (yeah, yeah, yeah)

Yo, it's been a long week
How I've got this much energy is beyond me
I just want all of these girls to be on me
And maybe even one of them could be Beyonc√©
We ain't gonna pack that rap noise in
All of that cheesy stuff: Clap, clap, sing!
And we're gonna burn some calories
Right here, right now
Ain't over 'til a fat boy slims, mama

[Chorus]
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump

Bust a little jiggy as the
Drum track pounds
Half the room are just making their own crowd
With the other half jiving, I love that sound
(What!)
Ah yeah yeah, I love that sound, what
Ah yeah yeah, I love that sound, uh
So flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like

When we step in to the room everybody makes a pathway
'Cause you know RK make the dance change
And we rule that crowd
And we don't change pace at the halfway
We, we keep it moving
We, we hold it down
Can't stop
Break sweat
No losing
Yes
Nobody gonna take my crown
Hold back
Na na na na, never gonna happen
Go back
Na na na na, never gonna happen
Especially when it's all packed out
Crowd shouting out
Yeah, I love that sound
Ah yeah yeah, I love that sound, what
Ah yeah yeah, I love that sound, uh
So flick your fag butts at once on a mad one like
Yeah, your mama can hump
[Chorus]
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
(Yeah, do the hump mama!)
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
(Yeah, yeah, do the hump mama!)
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
Mama do the hump, mama do the hump hump
Mama won't you please, let me do the hump hump
