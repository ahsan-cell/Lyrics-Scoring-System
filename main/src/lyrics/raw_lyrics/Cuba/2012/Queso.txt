I really don't know why I called (Why you call her)
I said I really don't know why I called (Why you call her?)
I said I really don't know why I called (Why you call her?)

I said I really don't know why I called (Why you call her)

See the dawn while at the job (while at the job)
It's not as bright as you
See the moon when I get up (when I get up)
The whole world wanna kick it
If my cell don't handle business
Even with a million digits
Only seven peak my interest

At least your not the cigarette (not the cigarette)
That's what I tell myself
Addicted to your confidence (your confidence)
So when it's late night, grab the phone
Make me wait to get you home
Going through her draws
Even though I got it all
