[Verse 1]
Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, oh, taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit, oh, by a flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Oh, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet

[Verse 2]
Sweet child, in time, you'll see the line
The line that's drawn between good and bad
See the blind man shooting at the world
Bullets flying, mmm, taking toll
If you've been bad, Lord, I bet you have
And you've not been hit, oh, by flying lead
You'd better close your eyes
Oh, bow your head
Wait for the ricochet
