In the doorway boy, she was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy and tears boy
And all in your inner space boy

You had hand girls boy and steel boy
You had chemicals boy, I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just groan boy
She said, "Come over, come over", she smiled at you boy

Drive boy, dog boy, dirty numb angel boy
In the doorway boy she was a lipstick boy
She was a beautiful boy and tears boy
And all in your inner space boy

You had hand girls boy and steel boy
You had chemicals boy, I've grown so close to you
Boy and you just groan boy
She said, "Come over, come over", she smiled at you boy

Let your feelings slip boy but never your mask boy
Random blonde, bio high, density rhythm
Blonde boy, blonde country, blonde high density
You are my drug, boy you're real boy

Speak to me and boy dog, dirty numb cracking boy
You get wet boy, big, big time boy, acid bear boy
Babes and babes and babes and babes and babes
And remembering nothing boy
Well you like my tin horn boy and get wet like an angel, derail
You might also likeYou got a velvet mouth, you're so succulent and beautiful
You're shimmering and dirty, wonderful and hot times
On your telephone line and God and everything
On your telephone and in walk an angel

And look at me, your mom squatting pissed in a tube
Hole at Tottenham Court Road, I just come out of the ship
Talking to the most blonde I ever met

Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Shouting, lager, lager, lager, shouting

Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega white thing
Mega, mega

Shouting, lager, lager, lager, lager
Mega, mega, white thing
Mega, mega, white thing

So many things to see and do in the tube hole
True blonde going back to Rumford
Mega, mega, mega going back to Rumford
Hi mom, are you having fun?
On your, are you on your way to a new tension headache
