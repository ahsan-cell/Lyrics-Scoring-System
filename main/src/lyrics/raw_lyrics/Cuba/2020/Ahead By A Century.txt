First thing, we'd climb a tree
And maybe then we'd talk
Or sit silently
And listen to our thoughts
With illusions of someday
Cast in a golden light
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's where the hornet stung me (That's where the hornet stung me)
And I had a feverish dream (I had a feverish dream)
With revenge and doubt
Tonight, we smoke them out

[Chorus]
You are ahead by a century (This is our life)
You are ahead by a century (This is our life)
You are ahead by a century

[Verse 2]
Stare in the morning shroud
And then the day began
I tilted your cloud
You tilted my hand
Rain falls in real time
And rain fell through the night
No dress rehearsal
This is our life

But that's when the hornet stung me (That's when the hornet stung me)
And I had a serious dream (I had a feverish dream)
With revenge and doubt
Tonight, we smoked them out

[Chorus]
You are ahead by a century (This is our life)
You are ahead by a century (This is our life)
You are ahead by a century
You are ahead by a century (This is our life)
You are ahead by a century (This is our life)
You are ahead by a century
And disappointin' you's gettin' me down
