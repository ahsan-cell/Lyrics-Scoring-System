Hey jayjay how did you come up with this album
And what made you decide to speak to the people?
Are you scared of what they might do to you?
Where did you get the time to be able to make this
Big of an album while having two kids?
Are you doing it for the money?
Are you doing it for the peace?
Do you happen to care what other people think of you?
What do you plan to do next?
Do you plan to make this a career or is this just to pass the time
Please speak to the camera

[Verse 1]

I'm anti social, move that stupid camera
When i'm on the social you gonna see the hazard
I don't deal with bastards, tell ya fam its over
Tell ya fam i'm local, they gonna see me damn it (shit)
Every line man every bar i plan it
Y'all can claim you hard but got no way to brand it
Ill show my scars before i leave this planet
Panic, landed, stranded, vanish, canted, woh
Hype right night, fight feel
Light pipe slight, tight real
I just might hit you
Switch eyesight polite deal
You might also likeThis my new level, this my new mental
I'm feeling special, you still a vessel
Call me the devil, have been by several (maybe more)
Still a rebel ill kill you pencils
Keep fundamental y'all to judgmental
Stick you with a needle full of thiopental
Put you in the back of the vehicle rental
Wrapped up shipped off continental (Later)
I just wanna get to the next spot
Eat don't stop, to hot, hip-hop
You a flip flop guy
I'm fly like the birds you like land to dry so

[Hook]

Take a picture
(i'm fresh enough don't be shy come on lets get this over with)
I said take a picture
(You pushing buttons don't be playing games now)
Take a picture (Flash no flash i really don't care hoe)
I said take a picture (man Y'all slow as fuck)
It'll last you longer

[Verse 2]

You think ill fall off son, you got it twisted (So twisted)
Like democrats republican this is
Brainwash in this system bitches, so lost god what is this horrific
Morbific driven clinics, all full of people cuz you will not listen
(Like god)
Or visit specific gimmicks are all laid out by the village or British
While that's going on, you wanna take a fuckin picture (dude)
Picking at my flaws, you got some balls lil woo
Watch my mouth while i swerve for the victor
Fuck the south i'm only here to get richer (Yeh Yeh)
First red carpet shoot, grab my junk
That's For all the dope haters giving dabs n love
Y'all mad on drugs pathetic life or was
You gotta grow some time before the bad times come
Gotta Flow wit time n let the sad times go
Stay dope combine that wit a fat fine roll (Nice)
N then you get a mind that pay a mind to all the crap signed
You all hella blind like a blind guy yo (Oh damn)
But y'all want the bangers, that would be dangerous
If i kept that up id be stranger then strange is
But i know my lane its, under maintenance
Straight inhumane i became Mistaken For low insane

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

If i can talk my girl into a threesome (yeh)
I can talk your mind to be indecent (Yeh)
If i can diss the world without a reason (Look)
I can make you learn n get ideas (haha)
Recently i been just letting it go
Thoughts in my head but just not on a post
Cuz i got the mic n the talent will show
This not a challenge wit skills n a flow
N the shit that i say people wanting my throat
Cuz they killing the planet, just letting y'all know
No time for a Xanax that's bad for the game (Shit)
Stupid dumb emo still under control (so Stupid)

Fuck all that mumbling, juggling wit the vocab lines
Y'all slow in mind like Prozac
A shit ton of drugs describes your whole track
Hope you saved a lil cash for the love you'll get back (Yep)
I thought you changed? well i did its strange
I went from rocker, to emo, to rapper then plain
But still got an ego, learn faster then gain
These Fans like casinos like cash n some change (Just watch)
Jaythelostking like a diamond that's cut
I ain't even trying this shits in my blood (yeh yeh)
Music n rap i was sent here to shove
I'm to much for the game cuz they hate where i'm from like fuck
