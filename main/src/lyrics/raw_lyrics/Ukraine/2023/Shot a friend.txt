Wish I met him years ago, years ago
Would it be so wrong?
Would it change this song?
I knew that she had it all, had it all
Thought I'm being strong, you know?

[Chorus]
I never shot my friend
Cause, baby, in the end
Nobody knows what to do with love
I'm singing la-la-la-la-la
I'm all alone, staring at the phone
I never shot my friend
Cause, baby, in the end
Nobody knows what to do with love
I'm singing la-la-la-la-la
I'm all alone, staring at the phone

[Verse 2]
Lost the man I never had, never had
Hard to lose a friend, hard to understand
Why you went along with that, along with that?
This wasn't my plan at all

[Chorus]
I never shot my friend (Oh, no, no)
Cause, baby, in the еnd
Nobody knows what to do with love (To do with love)
I'm singing la-la-la-la-la
I'm all alone, staring at thе phone
I never shot my friend
Cause, baby, in the end
Nobody knows what to do with love
I'm singing la-la-la-la-la
I'm all alone, staring at the phone

Beautiful story, no happy ending for ya'
I took a bite and  then I never stopped
Baby, I'm sorry, you know I'd never hurt ya'
But curiosity killed the cat

[Chorus]
I never shot my friend (Oh, no, no)
Cause, baby, in the end (oh, baby, in the end)
Nobody knows what to do with love (o do with love)
I'm singing la-la-la-la-la
I'm all alone, staring at the phone

[Outro]
I never shot my friend4
