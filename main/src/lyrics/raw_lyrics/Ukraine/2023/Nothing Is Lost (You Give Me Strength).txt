I thought I could protect you
From paying for my sins
And I been walking this earth
Long enough that death's a gift (Oh, girl)

[Pre-Chorus]
Been living this life so patient
Until I see you again, it's war we're facin'
I know that if I die, my only choice is still defending
No matter what they say
My love for you is greater than their powers
And their armies from above

[Chorus]
You give me strength
I'm with you either way
If I die, if I stay
Give me strength
I'm with you either way
Nothing's lost, no more pain
Just give me strength

[Verse 2]
The scars and the wounds
I wear them proud like tattoos
Rеminds me that I lost you
Reminds me that I'll bе
