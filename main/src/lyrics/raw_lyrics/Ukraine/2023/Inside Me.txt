Rock- rock the-

[Hook x2: Advizer and Crescent Moon]
We don't need no egos to be dope, we just need people
Who need people who know people to freak flows, meet goals, and grow, yo

[Verse 1: Advizer]
The chicks be like "Is he Nicks?", you be like "Diddy snips"
Sixty six, mix these sticks when you was thinking of the shit
Cuz all I got's thoughts, problems
Hobgoblins throwing oblong things that dragons turn into hot dogs
And steaks making hodgepodges for not nodding
For you like rock's boxes, Oddjobs is
Accomplices that compliment each other
The smartest honest modest artists, shooting stars just like comets
Minus arms in an addition to anonymous fame
First man from the Earth and eponymous my namе
Migraine's synonymous with my brain, I'm getting off of this highway
To Heavеn and I remain on the right lane
To exit, I drive reckless
So why you acting all gassed up at the station like you need directions?
I test kids without the written nor the usage of a number too
Hard to handle like carpal tunnel crews, wondering who
Is taking the pronouns in their poems so personal
I just remembered the leopard cannot change his proverbial
Spots, you cannot get with this big commercial
Of style you'll grow out like the mics at our first show
On my path you half step, it's obvious the shoe fit
It's a shame that the truth was four sizes too big
Ooh, did I forget to mention? No I didn't
I was spitting all that important shit when you weren't paying attention

Yo, rhyming live is my 9 to 5
I only do it to get through shit, never to fantasize
I'm like your hands and eyes, you can feel it, can't always see it
Be it in my bloodstream though most kids is anemic
So take the scenic route, I'll take your ego for a pep talk
Come off like centerfolds, producers couldn't produce a wet spot
Step off cuz your rep's soft
Charging like a bull with credit cards and rappers is the red cloth
Verbal quicksand step into this man
When I alter egos of awkward people, cram this mic in your beer hole
Rhymes I got an earful, I'm cheerful when I'm sad
And misinterpret ink blots so scientists think I'm bad
Had to open your head and then take a walk inside
I think they're all brain dead, I can still smell the formaldehyde
Your pals have lied, they didn't wanna hurt your confidence
Cuz you're running outta common sense like compliments
It's gotta be the lyrics as my appearance is an aid putting fear in kids
But I put the O in out of order
I gotta surround the border and welcome aliens to my country
It's funny, I'd rather have your respect than your money
And my nose is running from the dust piles in my room
You can find my past under X File: Crescent Moon
Your style's destitute and definitely desolate
I find it deceiving and mischievously desperate
[Hook x2: Advizer and Crescent Moon]
We don't need no egos to be dope, we just need people
Who need people who know people to freak flows, meet goals, and grow, yo

[Verse 3: Advizer]
When I grab the mic, I grasp the outer limits
If I had a life I doubt that I would live it
Cuz I'm satisfied with simply how the minutes
Passed me by, was pacified and now I'm different
Cancel my store subscription, write some more nonfiction
I'll be straight at my first twist with a mortician
The poorest rich men in the world don't have a clear conscience
I still ignore the friction and try to steer off
Into my own way of something, forgetting what it meant to me
I have a tendency of wallowing in negative energy
I vibe off the bowl, not letting the dopeness get to me
Prescribing a full dose of how it is and how I tend to see
Things in a different light, you got pulverized relentless
When you got the big mouth and those gopher sized intentions
Don't believe me? Well come on down, bring your crew
Advizer knows a thing or two about a thing or two

[Verse 4: Crescent Moon]
Call me old fashioned, I got passions grabbing mic cords
Escaping max security psych wards so I can write more
Shoulda chosen the right door for paradise
But you chose the janitor's closet, I'll push you in there and lock it, spare your life
You can't see me like Fabio up on your patio
Over most hardcore niggas' heads like pantyhose
And Channy knows the reason that my brain don't function properly
Cuz I overheat it, leave it hot like stolen property
I'm outflowing out to be, I oughta be arrested
Deeply congested and I keep lottery tickets guessing
The more the pleasant, the few the proud who blew the crowd
Leaving mushroom clouds, I gotta stop thinking out loud
You might get a vasectomy or a bad check from me
Just try not to get on my bad side and that's next to me
I dissect MCs alphabetically in the directory
From amateur assholes to zombies who was never meant to be
[Hook x2: Advizer and Crescent Moon]
We don't need no egos to be dope, we just need people
Who need people who know people to freak flows, meet goals, and grow, yo

[Verse 5: Advizer]
I write and think I'm tight as hell, yeah that ain't hard to tell
But I want you to feel what I'm saying on a larger scale
So when it snows, I'll use my dick as a pencil, take a piss and spray yellow
I hate these kids and fake fellows, I'll make you lick my brake pedal
Out of hatred, not a mean person by nature
Well maybe I am, but that's only when the mic's in my hand
Cuz then when I hold it, I feel like I'm better than you
And since I've had that attitude, I got to believing that it's true

[Verse 6: Crescent Moon]
Well if the sky ain't falling, it's all in my imagination
Inhaled one too many toxic fumes at the gas station
I'm locked in a glass maze where all I have is my reflection of question
And I got second thoughts bout taking a breath in
Lately, I've stepped in messes of epic proportions
It crept in my foreskin as a warning
Now as I awake, every morning in the storming weather greets me
I plug in the mic cord and let the music teach me

[Outro]
How you like me now?
