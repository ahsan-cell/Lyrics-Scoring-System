No, I won't forget you
Won't forget you
Derulo

[Verse 1]
I could see it in your eyes
I'll only have you just for a time
I'll believe your every lie
Call it love or suicide

[Pre-Chorus]
When I fell for you, it only took a minute
Hopin' that the moment never finish
We both know the truth
When you leave, I'm tryin' to forget it
How am I supposed to go on livin'?
Comparin' everybody to you

[Chorus]
No, I won't forget you
Won't forget you
No, I won't forget you
Won't forget you
No, I won't forget you
Won't forget you
I will never let you go

[Verse 2]
Diamonds fallin' down your face
Tell me who you're tryna replace
'Cause it hurts so good to fill this space
And nights like this, I can't erase

[Pre-Chorus]
When I fell for you, it only took a minute
Hopin' that the moment never finish
We both know the truth
When you leave, I'm tryin' to forget it
How am I supposed to go on livin'?
Comparin' everybody to you

[Chorus]
No, I won't forget you
Won't forget you
No, I won't forget you
Won't forget you
No, I won't forget you (Forget you)
Won't forget you
I will never let you go

Mm (Oh no), mm (No)

[Outro]
No, I won't forget you (Forget you)
Won't forget you, babe
I will never let you go
