Fear compounding in intensity biding it's time
Tear apart the shades of reflection
Leading our children into his delusion
Ten thousand years from the pit he ascended
Last survivor of a race of hellion creatures
I am survivor of blood
Sacrifice to me to feed your voracity
I am the ruler of thieves
I have created reality, created disease
I am the ruler of greed
I seek blood for the sacrifice
Call upon your deities
Death by fire your eternal engagement
Voices suffocated in ritual devotion
Apprehension is the meaning of pain
My kingdom rises in endless indulgence
I am moloch
Sacrifice to me
I am moloch
Sacrifice unto meYou might also like
