If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it

[Chorus]
If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
(Hehehe)

[Verse]
Won't you give that shit a rest?
Said you needed love, but you're only here for sex, and
And I'm dyin' to be next
Killed me once before, I just come back more obsessed with you
Nothing that I need to say
That hasn't been said (You)
I don't need an apology
Just show me instead

[Pre-Chorus]
If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you're bad for me
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it (Won't stop thinkin' 'bout it)
You might also like[Chorus]
If you think I'm pretty, lay your hands on me
Know you can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
I know that you're shitty and you'rе bad for me
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout it
