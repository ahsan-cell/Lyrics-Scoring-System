Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
The well-well-wellspring breaks through its way
No matter, no matter what, the world is on her shoulders
Circum-circum-circumlocutions are serpentine, cliffy
But know: your own happiness is in your hand

[Bridge: Jerry Heil]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Come on, baby, burn
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm not holy, I'm alive

[Chorus: ⁣alyona alyona & Jerry Heil]
Mama Teresa and Virgin Mary are with us
Barefoot, as if on the blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the divas were born as the human beings
Mama Teresa and Virgin Mary are with us
Barefoot, as if on the blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the divas were born as the human beings

[Verse: ⁣alyona alyona]
Even when we were small, we searched for a way
But life is a loop, as if for those who fall
On her shoulders, a small girl still
Carries a vat of pain and sees that it is a defect
Not like that again, then too soft
Clothes on the bones, naked or under a wreath
Where is your child? What is your life?
But the years fly-by; and then: soon it will be over
And though someone want us to break
Though there is a charge in you not up to the elbow, but up to the finger
And though someone hides hatred and envy behind a smile
When you let anger into your heart, instead of kindness and love
But there are saints in heaven: their feet have seen this earth
You know, your thorny path is not in vain for this reason
And though it may be very scary and dark and sometimes not easy
But the ancestors will always follow you from heaven
You might also like[Chorus: ⁣alyona alyona & Jerry Heil]
Mama Teresa and Virgin Mary are with us
Barefoot, as if on the blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the divas were born as the human beings
Mama Teresa and Virgin Mary are with us
Barefoot, as if on the blade, they walked on the ground
With us mama Teresa, Diva Maria
All the divas were born as the human beings
