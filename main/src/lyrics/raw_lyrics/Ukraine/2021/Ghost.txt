I'm a walking contradiction, baby, don't you try to figure me out
Got Holy Ghost conviction, confliction, when the sun goes down
You know where to find me on a Sunday morning
But tonight, I come with a whiskey warning

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, sweetheart with a wild side
Girl next door with a rebel smile

[Chorus]
Guess I'm one of those crazy angels
Tilted halo with a neon shine
Call me one of those crazy angels
Even good girls wanna have a good time
Heaven knows I'm flying low tonight

[Verse 2]
I ain't the only one of us to come down onto this dive bar floor
You might not see our wings, we check 'em at the door
We could be dancing or at a booth in the corner
Never know what song we'll rock with that jukebox quarter

[Chorus]
Guess I'm one of those crazy angels
Tilted halo with a neon shine
Call me one of those crazy angels
Even good girls wanna have a good time
Heaven knows I'm flying low tonight (Woo)
Mm

Crazy angels
Only the good ones get to hold onto
Crazy angels
Oh, boy, you'll count your blessings if she falls for you

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm one of those crazy angels
Tilted halo with a neon shine
Call me one of those crazy angels
Even good girls wanna have a good time
Heaven knows we're flying low tonight

[Outro]
This crazy angel's flying low tonight, hey
