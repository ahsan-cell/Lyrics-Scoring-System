That fragile peace of mind
Always says, "You're doing fine"
But it's never what it seems
Don't blame it on me
Reckless round of thoughts
Always show you what you'd want
But it's never what you need
Don't blame it on me

[Build]
Don't blame it on me, on me
Don't blame it on me, on me
Don't blame it on me, on me
Don't blame it on me, on me

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
We crave the light, escape the darkness
But twilights grip you in its hold
I saw the truth was dancing blindfold
Tiptoeing on a tightrope

[Build]
Don't blame it on me, on me
Don't blame it on me, on me
Don't blame it on me, on me
Don't blame it on me, on me
On me
