Green Hopadillo
Spacin' to the Fifth Dimension
Steady payin' homage to the past Puppet wanderin' keeping the feelins hostage
A lot of cats get half-way and feel they've lost it
Lookin' for the life they had and how it fostered
Cultivated crops
When the praise stops
So did the meaning
Forgot if ego had a grasp on the greeting
On the breathing
On the fiending of a pen
Or the feeding of man
Cause we're fleeting from the path where
You do it for the love not for the math
The sanity and the wrath
The Hunger Continues Pat
The summers and winter graph
A steady route
And every single sentence that
Came out my mouth
Recorded released is relevant
I shouldn't have to validate it if there's evidence

Do what you love and love what you do
Exhale negativity inhale gratitude
Do what you love and love what you do
Exhale negativity inhale gratitude
Do what you love and love what you do
Exhale negativity inhale gratitude
Do what you love and love what you do
