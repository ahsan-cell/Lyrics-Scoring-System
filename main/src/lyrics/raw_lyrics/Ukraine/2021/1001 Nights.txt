Sin Squad pull up, they cut
They don't wanna hold that cheffing
Numerous 2s been wetted
And 9, me and TY who wet him
Free up my niggas that are locked in can, doing Oz and toes, start stressing
I remember back then, tings weren't rating my ting, now they all want my attention
Sin Squad pull up ,they cut (They cut)
They don't wanna hold that cheffing
Numerous 2s been wetted
And 9, me and TY who wet him
Free up my niggas that are locked in can, doing Oz and toes, start stressing
I remember back then, tings weren't rating my ting, now they all want my attention

[Verse 1: N Splasha]
Been baking off on block
Consistent crashings and turned up scrubs (Come on)
And I kept it up, got banned from the flow, couldn't give a fuck (Fuck it)
But how you get bagged for the flow? (Free flow, free flow)
That shit's all ments (Ments)
In the jailhouse trynna get henched
In the gym 1 10 on the chest man bench (Lower)
Patrol and my blade's all drenched
The teeth in the ramz garn tear out your flesh (Splash, splash)
Buy vests if you know what's best
He's holding 4 or more, no less
Splish, splash
The scene's a mess
I will confess, he tried protest (Fuck it)
But he still got done up
They jet anytime we run up (Ching)
Catch him, catch him, in love with the action
Dashing off won't prevent this splashing
I'm with Trills, Sav or Bully
SS in the ride, we charged up fully
Pull up on your bae, like "yo, what's goodie?" (What's goodie?)
All I want is noddy
She want bruck her back for a sinner
No way can I treat her to dinner (Ay, fuck off)
You don't know bout governers busting your door, telling you that you're high on the radar
They had me on seasick
Top 10 in the jail most active
Security spins cah I'm moving erratic
Live O crash my man on the landing
Crash my man and the gang stay static
2 man up and his gang didn't back it (Some pussies)

[Verse 2: TP]
Broski's telling me chill, I've just come can I ain't trynna go back (No way)
Me and Blacks still stuck in the trap
Mish and mash, I'm stacking it fab
Rudeboy you ain't talk bout racks
Likkle man, he ain't seen 10 racks (No, no)
I might aim it high like Jigga
Or do man dirty like Gunner (Bow, bow)
How you garn tell me bout workers
Me, I'm my own damn worker (Smash)
Trap from AMs to PMs
Don't believe me, ask my GMs (Come on)
Swing and ching like Samurai Jack (Ching, ching)
Trynna make the blade go through him
Rambo out on the 9
Who wants to hold this cheffing? (Shh, shh)
I've rid 1000 nights in jail, rudeboy you can't hack 1 night (No, no)
I ain't gotta talk too much, they know what I did, they know what I done
Pull up to can, 3 yutes cah juice got spilled in the 9, it's fucked (Hold that)
Me and TY gave him 7
Should've sent the fuckboy to heaven (Heaven)
Back then it was medium wettings
Now it's smokey settings (Settings)
Cah any 9 boy I catch
Imma put him on a shirt no cap
I'm anti green, they know where I'm from
Stop acting dumb
All you'll hear is the tire screechings
And the sound of the drum (Drum)
