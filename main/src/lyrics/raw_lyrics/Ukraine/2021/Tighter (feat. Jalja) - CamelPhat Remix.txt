[Verse 1]
Bitterness on your tongue
You're a tip like venom
Don't you miss what we had?
I just don't understand
Is there a cure
Is there a cure

[Verse 2]
Bitterness on your tongue
You're a tip like venom
Don't you miss what we had?
I just don't understand
Is there a cure for this poison
Are you aware of what you've chosen?
Because I'm not and now I'm frozen
Now I'm afraid of what I'm losing
Is there a cure (frozen)
Is there a cure

Was I always your babe?
Don't you want me to stay?
How did our love turn to hate?
Can't accept our fate
Rushing through my veins
It's numbling all the pain
You were the best I ever had
Maybe poison isn't that bad
And I
I should have held you much tighter
Held the memories a little longer
Instead of leaving it all behind

[Outro]
Is there a cure (frozen)
Is there a cure
Is there a cure
