Sun's always falling
Weightless and free
Now when you close your eyes
Just breathe, breathe with me

[Chorus 1]
Let go
Release
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release, over and under till you return to me

[Verse 2]
The sky's always falling
Weight underneath
And when you close your eyes
Just breathe, breathe with me

[Chorus 1]
Let go
Release
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release, over and under till you return to me

[Chorus 2]
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release of the way you are
Let go of the way you're feeling
Release, over and under till you return to me
