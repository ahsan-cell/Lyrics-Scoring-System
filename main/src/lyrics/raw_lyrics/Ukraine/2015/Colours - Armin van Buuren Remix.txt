Would you do it all the same?
I wonder? Oh, would I?

Of the promises we made
Is there anything you'd change
In the re-runs of our lives?

If I could call you for a day
Just to hear the words you'd say
I would, oh

All the colours that you bring
All come rushing back again
All the places that we've been
This time

All the people that you knew
They'll come running back to you
All the faces that we've seen
This life

All the colours that you bring
All come rushing back again, again...

All the people that you knew
They'll come running back to you
All the faces that we've seen
This life
You might also likeAll the colours that you bring
All come rushing back again, again...
