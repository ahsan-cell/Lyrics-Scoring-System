The Temple of Ekur
Unites Heaven and Earth
Durangi Mountain House
The Garden of the Gods
Sumerian God of air
Or known as Enlil
Powerful is the son
Of Father Enkur
Lord so divine

[Chorus]
Fear, lead me into the vault
It's been said that Heaven knows I'm lost
Help me to see the bleeding upon the walls
And forever damned into the metaphors
Ah Egyptious
Ah Egyptious

[Verse 2]
Terrifying words
In the dungeon of Nungal
Queen of the abyss
Calls the sinner's end
Goddess of Ekur
And the Underworld
Worshiped by the sons
And Babylonians
So divine

Fear, lead me into the vault
It's been said that Heaven knows I'm lost
Help me to see the bleeding upon the walls
And forever damned into the metaphors
Ah Egyptious
Ah Egyptious

[Bridge]
Celebrating all
The offerings in gold
And pray for all the fallen
A priest in highest form
Speaks with devil tongues
Concealed from sunrise to sunset

[Chorus]
Fear, lead me into the vault
It's been said that Heaven knows I'm lost
Help me to see the bleeding upon the walls
And forever damned into the metaphors
Ah Egyptious
Ah Egyptious
Ah Egyptious
Ah
