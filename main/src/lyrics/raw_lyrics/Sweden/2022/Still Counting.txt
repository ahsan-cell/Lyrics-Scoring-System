Counting all the assholes in the room
Well, I'm definitely not alone, well, I'm not alone
You're a liar, you're a cheater, you're a fool
Well, that's just like me yoo-hoo and I know you too
Mr. Perfect don't exist my little friend
And I tell you it all again, and I'd do it again
Counting all the assholes in the room
Well, I'm definitely not alone, well, I'm not alone, zah

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Look deep into yourself before you blame
All others for betrayal, now for betrayal
I promise, so easy to say
And easy you fail and you'd do it again

[Chorus]
Well, the music seems to cover
And the liquid do the colors
Well, I turn my back and
Go for all the better things in order

[Verse 3]
Well, maybe you think your lie is safe
But I read you like a letter, yeah like a letter
Your charm do not evens the pain
It fills me with rage, and you'd do it again
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, the music seems to cover
And the liquid do the colors
Well, I turn my back and
Go for all the better things in order

[Chorus]
Well, the music seems to cover
And the liquid do the colors
Well, I turn my back and
Go for all the better things in order

[Outro]
And a gangster keeps on telling
That he got a song that matters
So I flip a coin towards him
Thank you very much for listening26
