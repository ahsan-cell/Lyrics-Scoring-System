Living in darkness became a burden in daylight
Carrying the souls of the dead and feeding them with life

[Refrain]
Stop wearing me out, I present you the gate
I'm passing you over and leave you with faith

[Verse 2]
You're living a second life that don't belong to you
Step out of my body, I believe you like it too

[Refrain]
Stop wearing me out, I present you the gate
I'm passing you over and leave you with faith

[Chorus]
You're now leaving
I couldn't rule with you
One minute to sing the shotgun bluеs
How you feeling?
Do you love it too?
One minute to sing thе shotgun blues

[Verse 3]
Thirty-two years have gone, you're now on the other side
Leaving with good energy, a blessing in disguise
You might also like[Refrain]
Stop wearing me out, I present you the gate
I'm passing you over and leave you with faith

[Chorus]
You're now leaving
I couldn't rule with you
One minute to sing the shotgun blues
How you feeling?
Do you love it too?
One minute to sing the shotgun blues

[Chorus]
You're now leaving
I couldn't rule with you
One minute to sing the shotgun blues
How you feeling?
Do you love it too?
One minute to sing the shotgun blues
