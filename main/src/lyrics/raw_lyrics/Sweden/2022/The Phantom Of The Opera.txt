In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now, I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

[Verse 2: Marco Hietala]
Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

[Verse 3: Tarja Turunen, Marco Hietala, Both]
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear
It's me they hear
Your spirit and my voice
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

[Bridge: Tarja Turunen]
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera
You might also like[Verse 4: Marco Hietala, Tarja Turunen, Both]
In all your phantasies you always knew
That man and mystery were both in you
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is
Here inside your mind

[Outro: Marco Hietala & Tarja Turunen]
Sing, my Angel of Music (Sing)
He's there the Phantom of the Opera
Sing for me
Oh sing my Angel, sing
Sing for me6
