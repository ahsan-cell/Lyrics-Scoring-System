The serpent knows
When the curtain falls
In denial's blindfold
It greets another day

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

[Chorus]
Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

[Hook 1]
I found secrets about life's undertow

[Verse 2]
Life's wrapped in a riddle
Easier said than done
Hate to play the victim
Let's run and hide

Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in

[Chorus]
Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

[Hook 2]
I found secrets about life's undertow
Let them take me far away

[Bridge]
Crawl back in place
It's easier to cope behind the curtain
Wipe the worries away
No thought about a consequence

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't believe the mask
It adapts to any lie
The perfect ten
When reality caves in
[Chorus]
Don't tell me
Tell my ghost
'Cause I blame him for all I don't want to know

[Hook 2]
I found secrets about life's undertow
Let them take me far away4
