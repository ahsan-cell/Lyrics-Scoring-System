[Verse 1]
I'm kneeling in front of the altar
Satan's cross upon the wall
Strange emptiness, a crystal ball between two candles
Melissa has entered another life

[Chorus]
Melissa, you were mine
Melissa, you were the light

[Verse 2]
She was a witch
Why did they take you away?

[Guitar Solo: Michael Denner]

[Chorus]
Melissa, you were the queen of the night
Melissa, you were my light

[Verse 3]
I swear revenge on the priest
The priest must die
He must die in the name of Hell
You might also like[Guitar Solo: Michael Denner]

[Chorus]
Melissa, can you hear me?
Melissa, are you there?

[Outro]
Nothing is left outside at the stake
They've taken her away from me
(I think Melissa's still with us)3
