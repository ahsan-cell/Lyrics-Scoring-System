Tonight the circle is meeting again
Who will be the first to fall in trance?
In here nobody is sensing the rain
Tonight a spirit we will glance

[Verse 2]
So as they're approaching ghostly hour
Seven people here are joining hands
They think they know the spirit to appear
Contact, the table starts to dance

[Chorus]
Time is standing still
It's a dangerous meeting
They're gonna get themselves killed
They're gonna get themselves killed

[Guitar Solo: Michael Denner]

[Verse 3]
Tonight, the circle is broken forever
Seven people dead within a trance
In here nobody is sensing the rain
Tonight, seven souls are reaching hell
You might also like[Chorus]
Time was standing still
The meeting is over
Their journey is on

[Bridge]
Oh, they should have known
Not to play with the powers of hell

[Outro]
Some people have lost their way
Some people have lost their mind
Oh, yes, their mind3
