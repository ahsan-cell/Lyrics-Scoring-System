Come, come to the sabbath
Down by the ruined bridge
Witches and demons are coming
Just follow the magic call
Come, come to the sabbath
Down by the ruined bridge
Later on the Master will join us
Called from the heart of Hell

[Verse 1]
At first we light up a fire
And then we hail our Lord
Two Candles, a black and a white are placed upon the altar
North, South, East and West
And so we clean the air
High priestess invoking the Devil
Infernal names are spoken

[Chorus]
Oh-oh
Come to the sabbath (Sabbath, sabbath, sabbath)
Oh-oh
Come to the sabbath

[Verse 2]
The ceremony's proceeding
It's time to grant your wishes
An evil curse on the priest who took the life of Melissa
Now we must close up the ritual, read the enochian key
And so it will be done, amen, now come
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh-oh
Come to the sabbath (Sabbath, sabbath, sabbath)
Oh-oh
Now come to the sabbath
Now here we come

[Guitar Solo: Hank Shermann]

[Outro]
If you say Heaven, I say a castle of lies
You say forgive him and I say revenge
My sweet Satan, you are the one
