Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home (Oh, won't you please take me home?)

[Verse 1]
Just a' urchin livin' under the street, I'm a
Hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me somethin' to eat
I'll pay you at another time, take it to the end of the line

[Verse 2]
Rags to riches, or so they say, you gotta
Keep pushin' for the fortune and fame
You know it's- it's all a gamble when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime, everybody's doin' the time
[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General says it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette, but I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe
[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home? Yeah

Captain America's been torn apart, now
He's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start"
I must be losin' my mind, "Are you blind?"
I seen it all a million times
[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
