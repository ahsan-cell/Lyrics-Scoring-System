[Verse 1]
Baptized with a perfect name
The doubting one by heart
Alone without himself
War between him and the day
Need someone to blame
In the end, little he can do alone

[Pre-Chorus]
You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give

[Chorus]
Caress the one, the never-fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth in a land
Of the daybreak

[Verse 2]
Apart from the wandering pack
In this brief flight of time
We reach for the ones who ever dare

[Pre-Chorus]
You believe, but what you see
You receive, but what you give
You might also like[Chorus]
Caress the one, the never-fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth in a land
Of the daybreak
Caress the one, the never-fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth in a land
Of the daybreak

[Bridge]
Reachin', searchin' for something untouched
Hearing voices of the never-fading callin' (Callin', callin')

[Chorus]
Caress the one, the never-fading rain in your heart
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth in a land
Of the daybreak
Caress the one, the never-fading rain in your heart (Caress the one)
The tears of snow-white sorrow
Caress the one, the hiding amaranth in a land (Save me)
Of the daybreak (Daybreak)8
