Ahh!

[Verse 1]
Ooh I was born on the cemetery
Under the sign of the moon
Raised from my grave by the dead
And I was made a mercenary
Ooh in the legions of Hell
And now I'm king of pain, I'm insane

[Guitar Solo: Hank Shermann]

[Bridge]
You know my only pleasure (Ahh)
Ooh is to hear you cry (Ahh)
I'd love to hear you cry
I'd love to feel you die
And I'll be the first
To watch your funeral (Ahh)
And I'll be the last, to leave (Ahh)
I'd love to hear you cry

[Guitar Solo: Hank Shermann]

[Verse 2]
And when you're down, beyond the ground
I'll dig up your body again
And make love to shame
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye (Goodbye)
Oh lady cry, and say goodbye
You might also like[Bridge]
You've gotta say goodbye (Ahh)
'Cause I will eat your mind (Ahh)
