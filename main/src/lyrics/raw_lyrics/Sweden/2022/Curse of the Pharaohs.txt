Away out in Egypt in the Valley of Kings
Where the mummified pharaohs
Pretend dead in their sleep, yeah

[Chorus]
Well, don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the Curse of the Pharaohs (Ahh, oh!)
Yes you'll be hit and the Curse is on you

[Guitar Solo: Michael Denner]

[Verse 2]
Now if you're breaking the seals
And disturbing the peace
Then you're starting up a Curse
Bringing evil disease, yeah

[Chorus]
Don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill
Or you'll be hit by the Curse of the Pharaohs (Ahh, oh!)
Yes you'll be hit and the Curse is on you

[Instrumental Break]
[Guitar Solo: Hank Shermann]
I'll be your pharaoh
You might also like[Verse 3]
The curse of the pharaohs can be so deadly
Or just destroying your future
Making it all shady, yeah

[Chorus]
So don't touch, never ever steal
Unless you're in for the kill (Kill, kill)
Or you'll be hit by the Curse of the Pharaohs (Ahh, oh!)
Yes you'll be hit and the Curse is on you

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah!
