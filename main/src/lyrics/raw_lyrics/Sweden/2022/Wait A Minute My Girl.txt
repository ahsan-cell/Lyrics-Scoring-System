Wait a minute, my girl
Wait a minute, my lover
Summer's up, but I want you to know
That I won't live a min(ute) without you

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for a while
I always had you on my mind
Now you're here in flesh and bones
My heart beats so and it's scaring me to death
But I can't …

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, my girl
Wait a minute, my love
Summer's up, but I want you to know
That I won't live a min(ute) without you

[Sax & Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, my girl
Wait a minute, my lover
Summer's up, but I want you to know
That I won't live a min(ute) without you

There's a light and it's right there in front of me
And a voice that whispers family
Don't ignore the signs
The symbols that are here
You might find thе reason why you're herе

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been waiting for a while
I always had you on my mind
Now you're here in flesh and bones
My heart beats so and it's scaring me to death
But I can't …

[Chorus]
Wait a minute, my girl
Wait a minute, my lover
Summer's up, but I want you to know
That I won't live a min(ute) without you

[Outro]
Try to say the right thing
My heart is beating like thunder
So wait a minute my
Wait a minute my
Wait a minute my
Wait a minute my
Wait a minute my
Wait a minute my
Wait a minute, my girl2
