Don't tell the gods I left a mess
I can't undo what has been done
Let's run for cover
What if I'm the only hero left
You better fire off your gun, once and forever?
He said go dry your eyes and live your life like there is no tomorrow, son
And tell the others to go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard

[Chorus]
We are the heroes of our time
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-oh-o-o-oes. o-uh-o-o-oh
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-uh-o-o-o
O-oh-o-o-oh
We are the heroes of our time
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh

[Verse 2]
The crickets sing a song for you
Don't say a word, don't make a sound
It's life's creation
I make worms turn into butterflies
Wake up and turn this world around
In appreciation
He said I never left your side
When you were lost I followed right behind
Was your foundation
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard (Now sing together)

We are the heroes of our time
Hero-uh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)

[Bridge]
Now go sing it like a hummingbird
The greatest anthem ever heard
Now sing together

[Chorus]
We are the heroes of our time
(Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh)
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
(Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh)
We are the heroes of our time
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
But we're dancing with the demons in our minds
(We keep dancing with the demons)
(You could be a hero)
Hero-oh-o-o-oes, o-uh-o-o-oh
[Outro]
We are the heroes12
