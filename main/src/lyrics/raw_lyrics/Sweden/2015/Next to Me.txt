As a kid, they told me love was made up
But I used to tell em they were wrong
Cause the blue-eyed girl who made me wake up
Will stay right by me in this song
I stood there counting every heartbeat
Thinking about the words to say
Tried not to understand that feeling
But would it ever go away?

[Chorus]
Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me?
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me

[Verse 2]
You told me we would be forever
But maybe we were just too young
I wonder if you still remember
When we were dancing in the sun
You might also like[Chorus]
Now those were the days
Before you had to go away
Now I'm dancing by myself
Out in the rain
Now it's getting rather cold
And I just wanted you to know
That if my dreams will ever be
Will you come dancing next to me?
Next to me
(Next to me, next to me, next to me, next to me)
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me
Next to me8
