I am, not made for working overtime
And you know, don't even like the nine-to-five
I wish all, those lazy days were every day
And you know, wouldn't want it any other way

[Pre-Chorus]
Although some might say, I throw life away
I just ain't got time to save
I might be insane, and I may complain
Don't believe no pain, no gain

[Chorus]
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doin' nothin' at all
I'm stressing over nothing
Don't bother to call
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doin' nothin' at all
Don't bother to call
I'm doin' nothin' at all

[Post-Chorus]
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I sleep!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I dream!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I sleep!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I dream!

I am, always almost there in five
And it's, always the night before deadlines
You know, don't bother calling before noon
Even when, you say "later" it's still too soon

[Pre-Chorus]
Although some might say, I throw life away
I just ain't got time to save
I might be insane, and I may complain
Don't believe no pain, no gain

[Chorus]
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doin' nothin' at all
I'm stressing over nothing
Don't bother to call
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doin' nothin' at all
Don't bother to call
I'm doin' nothin' at all

[[Post-Chorus]
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I sleep!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I dream!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I sleep!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I dream!]
[Bridge]
You may, not approve of my lifestyle
And while, you working I'll be living life
So you, can call me lazy if you like
Don't care, this is the story of my life

[Chorus]
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doin' nothin' at all
I'm stressing over nothing
Don't bother to call
I'm busy, busy, busy
Doin' nothin' at all
Don't bother to call
I'm doin' nothin' at all

[Outro]
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I sleep!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I dream!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
I wanna make money while I sleep!
Don't wanna work, work, work!
Don't wanna work!1
