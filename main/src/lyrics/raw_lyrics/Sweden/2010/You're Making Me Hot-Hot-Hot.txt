You're making me oh-o oh-o
You're making me oh-o oh-o
You're making me

I've been watching you all night, I really like the view
Got your touch, an honest match, and you've been watching too
And if you wanna feel my body step into my song
Get out on the floor, give me some more than standing on your own
Nice and slow, nobody else will know, this is a private show

You're making me hot-hot-hot
You're making me ro-o-ock
Come closer to me, feel the rush
You're making me hot-hot-hot
You're lifting me up-up-up
It's taken me over this crush

You're making me oh-o, oh-o
You're making me oh-o, oh-o
You're making me oh-o, oh-o

You're making me oh-o, oh-o
You're making me oh-o, oh-o
You're making me oh-o, oh-o

Just keep up the flow, I'd like you to go on and on for days
I can't get enough of you  no, I don't want you to stop
I know I'll miss it, the way that you kiss me, on that perfect spot
Nice and slow, nobody else will know, this is a private show

You're making me hot-hot-hot
You're making me ro-o-ock
Come closer to me, feel the rush
You're making me hot-hot-hot
You're lifting me up-up-up

Come baby, come baby, let me see you work it
Come baby, come baby, move your body
Come baby, come baby, gonna make you turn it
