(All around the world, all around the world)
(There's people in need)
Wherever you are
Oh oh
(Wish I had a million hands)
(So I could reach out to all of you)
Wherever you are
Let's go!

[Chorus: Apollo Drive]
I'm calling out to you again
Wherever you are
I know you sometimes feel afraid
Wherever you are
Oh oh

[Verse 1: Lazee]
Like the sun don't shine
Rain keeps falling and no one else minds
Me, somewhere close in the winter time
The same beat is as stable as a state of mind
When I'm lonely
Late night, cardboard box, hold me
I've been wrong see that drug's controllin' me
I keep on runnin' from the person tryin' to fold me, try to hold me
Mr. Invincible
People see me, shake they head every time they go
'Cause the signs says "Please give me something to eat"
But it wouldn't be a sign if I wasn't on the street
Don't wanna' commit a crime, but I can't feel my feet, for spice, you treat me like I'm harder than concrete
Excuse me if I'm livin' in doubt
Hopin' for the one you'll be callin' out
And that's why
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lazee]
Like guys and bruises
The melt of a life is so abusive
Talk with his hand, it's not a real man
These douchy feels without and my life is useless
Just scared to strike back, case I hit him real hard and there's no turnin' back
No turnin' back, n-n-no turnin' back
Hesitate the muse while the heart beat flat
Make up to cover up
No matter cause you can help to cover up
Kids get aggressive whenever somethin' up
See daddy do what when he gets fed up
Teachers are asking mad questions
She didn't ask 'cos she don't wanna stress him
Excuse her for livin' in doubt
Hopin' for the one day you'll be calling out
And that's why

[Chorus]

[Bridge: (Lazee) & Apollo Drive]
(No matter what you are in the world)
Wherever you are
(Asia, Europe, Africa, United States... wherever you are)
Wherever you are
(There's somebody that need a helping hand)
(Stretch out)
[Verse 3: Apollo Drive]
My story, you feel it?
I been trough the worst of times
Your hand, I'm needing
A helping hand today
Wherever you are

[Chorus]

[Outro: Apollo Drive]
(I'm calling out your name)
Wherever you are
(I'm calling out your name)
Wherever you are
(I'm calling out your name)
