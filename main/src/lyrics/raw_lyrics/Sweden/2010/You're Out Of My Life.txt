Now it's late, 4 .a.m., can't reach you
If I could turn back time and make you stay
Maybe then I would still be near you

You're out of my life, it cuts me like a knife
I'm wounded and it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Since I can't tell you

You're out of my life but did you have to die?
And now it's too late, too late, too late
To say I'm sorry

It's taken me across the universe
You were there when I was hurtful
And suddenly, one day you left this world
Now I'm lost on my own, it's over

You're out of my life, it cuts me like a knife
I'm wounded and it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Since I can't tell you

You're out of my life but did you have to die?
And now it's too late, too late, too late
To say I'm sorry
You might also likeSorry
(Aah, aah, aah)

You're out of my life, it cuts me like a knife
I'm wounded and it hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Since I can't tell you

You're out of my life but did you have to die?
And now it's too late, too late, too late
To say I'm sorry

You're out of my life
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts)
(It hurts, it hurts, it hurts)
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts
Since I can't tell you I'm sorry2
