Flo Rida
Bad boys, bad boys
Alexandra, girl, I know what you like
Ba-bad boys, bad boys (Ooh, ooh)
Bad boys, bad boys (Hey, yeah)
Ba-bad boys, bad boys

[Verse 1: Alexandra Burke]
Some people call them players
But I'm far from terrified
'Cause somehow I'm drawn to danger
And have been all of my life

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
It feels my heart's divided
Halfway 'tween wrong and right
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't mind

[Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye (Ooh-ay, ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
Ooh (Bad boys)

Some think it's complicated
But it's straight up fun for me (Oh, oh)
I don't need no explanation
It's nothing more than what you see

[Pre-Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
My heart still feels divided
Halfway 'tween wrong and right (Wrong and right)
I know I'm playing with fire
But I don't mind (Oh, ooh, yeah)

[Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
I said the bad boys are always spinning my mind (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry
With the bad boys always catching my eye (Ooh-ay, ooh-ay, ooh-ah)

[Bridge: Flo Rida & Alexandra Burke]
I know you want me shawty 'cause I'm aâ€” (Bad boy)
Hey, sh-shawty can't help it
She so, so addicted to them rougher fellas
With even the alphabet
She only sings the crooked letters
Let mama take all the risks for that chemistry
She like them tougher than leather
Not even the paws, it's more like a mama bee
Out lost that's on the reg'lar
By any means necessary, girl
She likes them ruthless, that's my world
It's not the news, it's what I heard
To get them more the merrier
It's not a big surprise
I know them bad boys catch your eyes
Look at her walk when I go in disguise
You'll have them shawty, don't worry, you fly
[Chorus: Alexandra Burke]
Yeah, the bad boys are always catching my eye (Always) (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
I said the bad boys (Bad boys) are always spinning my mind (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
Even though I know they're no good for me
It's the risk I take for the chemistry (Oh)
With the bad boys always catching my eye (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
Yeah, the bad boys are always spinning my mind (Ooh-ay, ooh-ah)
I said the bad boys are always catching my eye (Ooh-ay, ooh-ay, ooh-ah)

[Outro: Alexandra Burke]
Bad boys, bad boys1
