I need my soul to heal at last
What can you say to make me forget the past
If you decide to come home
I can't take that again
No more

Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
I pray that you would stay
Not turn and walk away
Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
Come back if love is true
I'm hollow without you

Why should I trust your sad eyes
What if you leave one rainy night
You've got to make a promise
Promise me to stay and fight

Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
I pray that you would stay
Not turn and walk away
Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
Come back if love is true
'Cause I'm hollow without you
You might also likeIf you love me
I f you need me
You will be there
Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
Don't turn and walk away

Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
I pray that you would stay
Not turn and walk away
Don't leave me now
I'm hollow
Come back if love is true
'Cause I'm hollow without you
I'm hollow without you
