I see you walk, see you walk into the night
Are we lost, are we lost? You went outta sight
Is it wrong, is it right, can you tell me now?
Will I see you again? You're my guiding light

[Pre-Chorus]
(Could we)
Could we travel in time?
'Cause I don't want my heart to fade away
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Time after time
Night after night
With you by my side
Everything feels so right
Sign after sign
Tryin' to find
The road back to Heaven with you
I wish to be that someone

[Post-Chorus]
I wish to be that someone
I wish to be that someone
You might also like[Verse 2]
Take me back, take me back to the summer night
When we dance, when we dance in the moonlight
Wanna know if you feel what I'm feeling now
Will I see you again? You're my guiding light

[Pre-Chorus]
(Could we)
Could we travel in time?
'Cause I don't want my heart to fade away
Oh, no

[Chorus]
Time after time
Night after night
With you by my side
Everything feels so right
Sign after sign
Tryin' to find
The road back to Heaven with you
I wish to be that someone

[Post-Chorus]
I wish to be that someone
I wish to be that someone
[Bridge]
I wish to be that someone
Wish to be that someone
You're someone
Wish to be that someone
Wish to be that someone
You're someone
Wish to be that someone
Wish to be that someone
You're someone
Wish to be that someone

[Outro]
(Could we)
I wish to be that someone
I wish to be that someone
(Could we)
Can we go back in time?
(Could we)
Can't get you out of my mind
(Could we)
Can we travel any time?
'Cause I don't want my heart to fade away
I wish to be that someone
