My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
Even if I could, it'll all be grey
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Pre-Drop]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
Even if I could, it'll all be grey
Put your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Drop]
Not so bad, not so bad
Not so bad, not so bad
Not so bad, not so bad
Not so bad, not so bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad
Not so bad
