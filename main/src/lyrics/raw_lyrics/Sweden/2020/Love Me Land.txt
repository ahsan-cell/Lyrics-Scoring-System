Never thought I would love again
Here I am, lost in Love Me Land

[Verse 1]
How dare you have lips like that
How dare you gon' kiss like that
How dare you make us a fact
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me in the way that you do
No matter who's in the room
I see you sweatin' when you feel it, goin' full out, baby
Touch me in the way that you do
No matter who's in the room
I see you sweatin' (Sweatin')

[Chorus]
Never thought I would love again (Never thought)
Here I am in Love Me Land, eh-eh, ah-ah (I would love again)
Never thought I would love again (Here I am)
Here I am in Love Me Land, eh-eh, ah-ah (Lost in Love Me Land)

[Verse 2]
Lost in your vocabulary
Got our own vernaculary
Take me home, don't call me Mary
Ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, ah
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Touch me in the way that you do
No matter who's in the room
I see you sweatin' when you feel it, goin' full out, baby
Touch me in the way that you do
No matter who's in the room
I see you sweatin' (Sweatin')

[Chorus]
Never thought I would love again (Never thought)
Here I am in Love Me Land, eh-eh, ah-ah (I would love again)
Never thought I would love again (Here I am)
Here I am in Love Me Land, eh-eh, ah-ah (Lost in Love Me Land)

[Bridge]
Eh-eh, ah-ah
Lipstick stain your soul
Eh-eh, ah-ah
So when you feel it, go full out, baby
Eh-eh, ah-ah
Can't contain my bones
Eh-eh, ah-ah
So when you feel it, go full out, baby

[Chorus]
Never thought I would love again (Never thought)
Here I am in Love Me Land, eh-eh, ah-ah (I would love again)
Never thought I would love again (Here I am)
Here I am in Love Me Land, eh-eh, ah-ah (Lost in Love Me Land)9
