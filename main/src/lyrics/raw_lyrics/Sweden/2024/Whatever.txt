There's a space in my heart
When it all comes crashin' down
Anytime I hear your name out in public
There's a place that I go
Every time that you're in town
It's just me and the knots in my stomach

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's true
It wasn't easy
Gettin' over you
But that's just what I had to do

[Chorus]
Whatever, whatever
We were never good together
I'll be here, and you stay there
Truth is, I never cared
Whatever, whatever
Two years, that ain't forever
I'll be here, and you stay there
Won't see me cry no tears

[Post-Chorus]
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears

Never mind, never mind
Feels like you were never mine
Go lose myself in the arms of a stranger
And yeah, it sucks, sometimes in love
You try your best, but it doesn't work out
And it don't matter either way, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Whatever, whatever
We were never good together
I'll be here and you stay there
Truth is, I never cared
Whatever, whatever
Two years, that ain't forever (Oh yeah)
I'll be here, and you stay there
Won't see me cry no tears

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Won't see my cry no tears)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Whatever, whatever)
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Won't see my cry no tears)
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
(Whatever, whatever)
Won't see me cry no tears
[Chorus]
Whatever, whatever
We were never good together
I'll be here, and you stay there
Truth is, I never cared
Whatever, whatever
Two years, that ain't forever
I'll be here, and you stay there
Won't see me cry no tears
