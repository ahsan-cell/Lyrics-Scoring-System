[Verse 1]
If you ever had a broken heart
You know this song is for you
If you ever felt the need to stop
Then you might just feel like I do
'Cause I'm tryna have a good time
My friends said I'll be alright
If you ever had a broken heart
Then you feel me, feel me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm out of a prison
You held me in for no reason
No more lying, just let me be

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Ring ring
Who's there?
I don't even have a clue
Ring ring
Who's there?
Kinda broken
But I
Wish you well, you well, you well
Wish you well, you well, you well
Ring ring
Who's there?
'Cause I'm so over you

I fell in love in Mexico City
Trouble, trouble
Was a guy with a bunch of tattoos
Problem, problem
One, two, three, you got over here
Four, five, six, and you disappeared
I fell in love in Mexico City
Trouble, trouble

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm out of a prison
You held me in for no reason
No more lying, just let me be

[Chorus]
I'm so over you
Ring ring
Who's there?
I don't even have a clue
Ring ring
Who's there?
Kinda broken
But I
Wish you well, you well, you well
Wish you well, you well, you well
Ring ring
Who's there?
'Cause I'm so over you
