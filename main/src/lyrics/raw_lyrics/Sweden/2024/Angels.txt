Takin’ a chance on me
Born to be wild
And free
See if it’s
Meant to be
Takin’ a chance
On me
I’ve gotta bleed
These dreams
Even if it means
I’ll lose everything

(Verse 1)
I’m at war with my self
I lose the battle at dusk
I put my faith in higher power
It’s in him that I trust
I use my powers nothing sour
I’m
Removing the lust
I think I found a hater
O shit made me blush
(Laughing)
I’m admitting my faults
I’m admitting my wrongs
Sometimes I am at lost
Like a dog with no bone
I walk through fire survived
I could never tell lies
But when thе angels
Form down
They always coming
With a prize
I lift my spirits
With praisе
I’m expressing my rage
Now that we on the same page
I hope next time you ain’t late
I’m still abundant to date
A lot of food on my plate
Although I made them mistakes
I think I still need a break
But when your life is
At stake
And you feeling the taste
There’s no time to
Go waste
You
Gotta hold on to faith
You might also like(Hook)
Takin’ a chance on me
Born to be wild
And free
See if it’s
Meant to be
Takin’ a chance
On me
I’ve gotta bleed
These dreams
Even if it means
I’ll lose everything

(Verse 2)
Don’t put your faith in me
Boy you’ll lose everything
(Everything)
Like everything you dreamed
Cause life ain’t what it seems
(Is it a dream?)
What if it all was dreamed
Sit in the highest tree
Smoking the highest tree
(Og)
I think they want a plea
Can’t get that over me
I think I’m safe at last
(Hopefully)
But tell me will it last
(I doubt it)
I walk on broken glass
Just to get to my class
I imagine things
And then they come to form
I just wanna feel the heat
Before I feel the storm
(Feel the rain)
If I lost everything
I mean like anything
What would that really mean
I think it’s time to plead
I take a chance on self
I take a chance on wealth
Now I live in stealth
Then let the candle melt
And
Even as walk through
Valley
I have no fear
I’m cruising through alleys
I am now self assured
Re birthed and enlightened
I say my mantras
Say em with me
Now I know
You excited
(Have to be)
(Hook)
Takin’ a chance on me
(Everytime I can, Every chance I get)
Born to be wild
And free
See if it’s
Meant to be
Takin’ a chance
On me
(As I sit in this tree, As I sit on top of the mountain)
I’ve gotta bleed
These dreams
(I pray for my dreams, I pray for me)
Even if it means
I’ll lose everything
