Ayo, Double, youâ€”
Rackz, Rackz, Rackz

[Verse]
Like, they ain't see what I seen
Like, they did not come from the gutter
Every day I was losin' my brothers
Sendin' my last to the bros, I was fucked up
And they knew I only had a hundred, but I gave 'em half of that shit 'cause I love 'em
Reminiscin', I'm missin' my Sweeps (Rackz)
Me and Jay standin' tall while everyone say fuck us
Two deep, we was stuck on that corner
Havin' thoughts about bein' in Warner
And the police, they keep tryna book me
Why do my family gotta record 'em?
Gotta tote on my G
I don't wanna do it, but I cannot go be a goner
Like, I gotta show the real me
Word to bro, with a gun or a mic, they call me a performer
May 5th, I got booked for a gun
September 5th the day that I came home
I got out jail, we kicked it for a month
My bro went to court, now I'm screamin', "Free Go"
Heard the news and that shit had me stuck
Need to feel a lil' hot 'cause my heart gettin' cold
And I thought that everything get better
But then they took Nazzy and shit had me broke
I'm on two feet, stayin' ten toes
Youngest nigga, I ain't never fold
They could never tell me that I'm pussy and shit
'Cause in jail, I did not have a pole
Like, I had the scalp, I had to go get crafty with it
Anything goin' down, they know I never told
Like, Casa' don't cap, they give me my infraction and shit
Word to bro, sent me back to the hole
Don't got time for a bitch, I been busy
Know you lyin' when you say you miss me
Actin' cute when you out with your bitches and shit
But you actin' different when you with me
I don't vent, I just talk to my sitchy
It keep tellin' me, "Fever, just grip me"
It be times that I wanna just put down the gun
But they tryna do me like I'm Diddy
Took a sip, now I feel a lil' tispy
And I can't let 'em do me like Nipsey
I don't need me a bitch screamin', "Pick me"
If you love me, ride when it get sticky
And brodie the ticket, did it on his own
That's why I keep tellin' Jay he got the city
Just keep rappin' 'cause shit gettin' mixy
Like, he don't gotta talk 'cause I'ma stay on fifty
Word to bro, I be thinkin' bout Chunky
Fifteen for a kid, that's a lot
I just want my brother to come home
But they tryna keep him in a box
I think about Nay while I'm tryna stay calm
But somethin' keep tellin' me I gotta flock
I got a big heart, I get it from my moms
They sayin' I get my anger from my pops
But we don't have talk and shit feelin' odd
All the shit that I've been through, I'm questionin' God
Like, I know the reason You don't be around
I only look for You when shit gettin' hard
I know one day, I'm gon' be a star
And I tell my brothers, "We are who we are"
I walk with my broom and hold this shit up like a trophy
'Cause this the shit that got me far
Like, SG home, a smile on my face
Then I heard the news, the smile went away
Like, I want a home, just need a happy place
Like, Kapp comin' home, today's just not the dayYou might also like
