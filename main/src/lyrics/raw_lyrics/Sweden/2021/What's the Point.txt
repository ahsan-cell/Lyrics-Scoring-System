If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again

Where do we go when we go from here?
Feels like a circle around me while I wait for more
Know that I wanna know where I follow you
Don't wanna go down the street where you once came from

And I, and I wanna know
What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again

What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again

A line of boxes in an open field
There's a million empty and there's one for real
Now do you want mе to go search in each all of them?
Or just lay on thе grass and act and pretend

That's what I, that's what I wanna know
What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again
You might also likeWhat's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again

Then you came to me and you said
I was not really sure enough how to feel
I pretend like you're not real
But then you came to me and you said
I was not really sure enough how to feel
I pretend like you're not real to me (-e, -e, -e, -e)

What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again

What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice?
I would sit and wait for you again

What's the point?
Don't you know
What's the point?
