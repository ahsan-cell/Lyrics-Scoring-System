You cut my breath lately
And now you've tried to find a way of getting out
I'm overwhelmed with worries
And it's too late for sorry's
And now you've tried to find a way of getting out

I carry too much that I can hold
Don't know how this story will be told
And I'm about to just explode

And we don't care
No more about the sadness
I bang my head to the wall, my life is savage
And we don't care if we're gonna live tomorrow
So put your hands up in the air if you will follow

I bang my head to the wall
And I forget it all
I bang my head to the wall
Can you catch me when I fall?
And we don't care if we're gonna live tomorrow
So put your hands up in the air if you will follow

It's like the world hates me
And there is no escaping
And all I really wanna do is shut them out
A few more heartbreaking
And nobody can save it
The water's rising up and I'm about to drown
You might also likeBeen holding it in for far too long
Trying so hard to right my wrongs
A silver battle rages on

And we don't care
No more about the sadness
I bang my head to the wall, my life is savage
And we don't care if we're gonna live tomorrow
So put your hands up in the air if you will follow

I bang my head to the wall
And I forget it all
I bang my head to the wall
Can you catch me when I fall?
And we don't care if we're gonna live tomorrow
So put your hands up in the air if you will follow

I bang my head to the wall
And I forget it all
I bang my head to the wall
Can you catch me when I fall?
And we don't care if we're gonna live tomorrow
So put your hands up in the air if you will follow
