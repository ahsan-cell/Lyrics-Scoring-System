Come back, baby
Don't worry 'bout me

[Verse 1]
I used to dream of you just like this
With me in your focus
But with every moment I'm losing it
Do you even notice
All the small things that feel different
For some reason you seem so distant
I know we're drifting but I can't quit
You don't even notice

[Chorus]
Come back, baby
It's better if we go too far
Don't worry 'bout me
It's just another broken heart
You've made this pain
Pretty like a piece of art
Don't worry 'bout me
It's just another broken heart

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel like you're not really here with me
And you just stick around because it sucks to leave
I keep standing tall but I'm on my knees
And I'm scared of heights, I can't breathe
I'm so stupid, I stay clueless
I keep trying but I can't do this
I've got one more trick tucked in my sleeve
Third times a charm, and I'm still naive
You might also like[Chorus]
Come back, baby
It's better if we go too far
Don't worry 'bout me
It's just another broken heart
You've made this pain
Pretty like a piece of art
Don't worry 'bout me
It's just another broken heart

[Post-Chorus]
It's just another broken, broken heart
It's just another broken, broken heart

[Outro]
You've made this pain
Pretty like a piece of art
Don't worry 'bout me
It's just another broken heart
Come back, baby
It's better if we go too far
Don't worry 'bout me
It's just another broken heart
