Can you love somebody that you never met?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Can you miss somebody that you don't know yet?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Verse 1]
When I saw you, you didn't notice
One of those moments just passing by
You don't know this, but I fell hopeless
Right on that corner, lost track of time

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody that you never met?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Can you miss somebody that you don't know yet?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Post-Chorus]
C-c-can't stop thinking about, can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you
C-c-can't stop thinking about, can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you

[Verse 2]
I've been asking, but no one knows you
Like a ghost you were here and gone
I'm still hoping to see you again
I'll wait forever if it takes that long
You might also like[Chorus]
Can you love somebody that you never met?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Can you miss somebody that you don't know yet?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Post-Chorus]
C-c-can't stop thinking about, can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you
C-c-can't stop thinking about, can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you

[Bridge]
Evеryone walked by
In this city, ain't no love for free
Whеn I saw your smile
I believe in something more than me
No, I can't stop thinking, can't stop thinking
Can't stop thinking about you

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody that you never met?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Can you miss somebody that you don't know yet?
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
[Post-Chorus]
C-c-can't stop thinking about, can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you
C-c-can't stop thinking about, can't stop
I can't stop thinking about you
