Ba-backseat love, backseat love

Get a job done in the parking lot
That is true love, that is true love
Let's get a job done in the parking lot
In the back seat of, in the backseat of your car

Let's get it jumping in the parking lot
That is true love, that is true love
Let's get a job done in the parking lot
In the back seat of, in the back seat of your car

Two O'Clock – Planet Rock
Playing on the radio in my new drop top
Same sign as last night:
"Credit cards or cash will take you to new heights."
Looking left, looking right, just because I wanna
No cops around, I'm standing on the corner
Suddenly, there she was
(I hope you got the right money)
Get my keys, and we're off

Get a job done in the parking lot
That is true love, that is true love
Let's get a job done in the parking lot
In the back seat of, in the backseat of your car

That is true love, that is true love
Let's get a job done in the parking lot
In the back seat of, in the back seat of your car

[Spankrock]
Say she ordinary, visionary
Automatic, innovation
Dipstick, stick shift
Trouble – double penetration
Smart car getting all ignorant
Look how far your back is bent
And I can't stop, won't stop
Till the rims pop off
Till the tears drop off

I can't wait to get at the crib
Get back to biz
Get your ass all red
My love is real
So I copped a feel
And start the drill
Don't stop, if the cops knock
You could take the wheel of skin
And be the first girl to ever, ever give good head
Get a job done in the parking lot
That is true love, that is true love
Let's get a job done in the parking lot
In the back seat of, in the backseat of your car

[Lady Tigra]
You can't go down if you talk a lot
Backseat love, backseat love
We can't jam if you talk a lot
In the taxi, in the backseat of your car

We just can't funky if you talk a lot
Backseat lover, backseat lover
We can't break it down if you talk a lot
Keep a taxi, in the backseat of your car

Get a job done in the parking lot
That is true love, that is true love
Let's get a job done in the parking lot
In the back seat of, in the backseat of your car

In the backseat, in the backseat of your car
