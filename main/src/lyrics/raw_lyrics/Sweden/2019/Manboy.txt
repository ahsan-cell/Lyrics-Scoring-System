You've got the looks
You've got the beauty inside
You've got the looks
That money can't buy
You want to live
Like all the stars on TV
You wanna love
With someone like me

[Pre-Chorus]
Gimme love, gimme love
And don't go
Gimme love, gimme ,gimme love

Manboy, manboy

There's no halo 'round my head, no
There's no angels here
Manboy, manboy
You can call me manboy
Ooh, oh
