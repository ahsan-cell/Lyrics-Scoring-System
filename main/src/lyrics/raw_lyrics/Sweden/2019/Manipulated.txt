I know it's dangerous
But this is how it's gonna stay(-ay)
I mean, everything you do
I don't need a reason
Cause I'm the one controlling the way this is play-ay-ay-ayed

Cause I know, you know, I know all I want
That you can't see what's really going on
'Cause the mind can't tell that you're famous
Things ain't always as easy when I do things your way(-ay)

(You're manipulated)
You're manipulated
You're manipulated
(You're manipulated)

I'm not one for playing sa-a-fe
Come lock me away-ay, and do what you say-ay
'Cause I know that you'd like to be making the rules
So I'll play the fool, you'll like when I do-o-o-o

Let's reverse psychology
I'm ready to comply-ay-ay-ay...You might also like
