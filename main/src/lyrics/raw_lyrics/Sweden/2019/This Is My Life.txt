I go down the beaten track
Along the river with an empty bag
At the end, she said to me
Why are you here
With the autumn leaves?

[Chorus]
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand
And this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

[Verse 2]
I'm done tipping on my toes
Strike an iron and untuck my soul
Misty moon you're gonna see
I've got your blues to get on my feet

[Chorus]
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand (This is my, this is my, this is my)
And this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

[Bridge]
I don't wanna run, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna hide
I just wanna stay for real
To be me
I don't wanna win, I don't wanna lose
I don't wanna play
I just wanna remember, ooh, my name
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And this is my time to stand (This is my, this is my, this is my)
And this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else

Ooh (This is my life, my friend)
(This is my, this is my, this is my)
(This is my time to stand)
(This is my, this is my, this is my)
'Cause this is my life, my friend
And I can't be no one else
(This is my, this is my, this is my)
Cause this is my life, my friend
And I can't be, no one else
'Cause this is my life, my friend
