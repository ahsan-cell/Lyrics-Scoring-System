Feels like a circle around me while I wait for more
Know that I wanna know where I follow you
Don't wanna go down the street where you once came from
And I wanna know

What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice
I would sit and wait for you again

A line of boxes in an open field
There's a million empty and there's one for real
Do you want me to go search in each all of them
Or just lay on the grass and act and pretend
That's what I wanna know

What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice
I would sit and wait for you again
What's the point of doing anything
If you'll never notice
I would sit and wait for you again

Then you came to me and you said
I was not really sure enough how to feel
I pretend like you're not real
Then you came to me and you said
I was not really sure enough how to feel
To pretend like you're not real to me
