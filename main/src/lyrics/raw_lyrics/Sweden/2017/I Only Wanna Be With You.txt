I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only knew I never want to let you go
You started something, can't you see?
And ever since we met, you've had a hold on me

[Chorus 1]
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you

[Verse 2]
It doesn't really matter what you say or do
I want to spend each moment, any day with you
Look what has happened with just one kiss
I never knew that I could be in love like this

[Chorus 2]
It's crazy but it's true
I only wanna be with you

[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only knew I never want to let you go
You started something, can't you see?
And ever since we met, you've had a hold on me
You might also like[Chorus 1]
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you

[Bridge]
You stopped and smiled at me
And asked me if I cared to dance
I fell into your open arms
And I didn't stand a chance

[Verse 3]
Now, listen honey
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'Cause you started something, can't you see?
And ever since we met, you've had a hold on me

[Chorus 3]
It happens to be true
I only wanna be with you
No matter what you do
I only wanna be with you1
