You eat, you sleep
You drag your feet
Get out of bed and earn your keep
Then rinse, repeat, and take your seat
Just let them think they've won
Now the road ahead is steep
And yet I feel the urge to run
So go ahead and leave
I know you hate that I've become

[Hook]
Like you (x2)

[Verse 2]
I'm tired
Of circling the drain
We make our choices
Then we end up the same
We've all been throwing low blows
And stepping on toes
It's the way to go!
Looking for someone to shoulder the blame

I need it
An injection of change
Within the horizon
That was mine to chase
We've been giving as we take
That we make mistakes just for mistakes sake
I don't know what's going on anymore

[Verse 4]
We hit the point of no return
I look back down just to see the Earth
And I forget what I am supposed to see
I ask what the problem is
She says she's waiting for a final kiss
Says she's forgotten what she's meant to do
So I run away
Run away

[Hook]
Like you (x2)
