Saturday I love you like gold
Not like the Monday
You pass like a ghost
The fire killed you like a motherless child
I saw you last Sunday at Barbara Hotel
Babe, I'm so sorry, I've nowhere to go

[Verse 1]
Could scream like a pig
Could bark like a dog
Just to get attention
As I'm chasing you down the hall
Oh,  Maybellene, you've been so lonely
Got a fire burning
As I'm smoking you out again
Still, all the leaves will keep on falling
Until I see you dancing
On the table forty-five again

[Chorus 1]
See you dancing for the young wolves
Maybellene I Hofteholder
Could you be the only one?
Well, I beg you to come home
Dance forever, my only one
You might also like[Verse 2]
Could scream like a pig
Could bark like a dog
Just to get attention
As I'm chasing you down the hall
Oh, Maybellene, you've been so lonely
Got a fire burning
As I'm smoking you out again

[Chorus 2]
See you dancing for the young wolves
Maybellene I Hofteholder
See you dancing for the young wolves
Maybellene I Hofteholder
Could you be the only one?
Well, I beg you to come home
Dance forever, my only one

[Outro]
I flicked the switch at Monday night
Maybellene, I'm so sorry
That I didn't see it coming
And now the sky I filled with prayers
Oh, Baby, I'm sorry I was blind
