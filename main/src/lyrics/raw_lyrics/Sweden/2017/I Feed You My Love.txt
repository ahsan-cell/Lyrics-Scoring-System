Through the dark night
You listen to me when I whisper
Broken words In your ear
And you push
You push me hard to the surface
I'm blinded at heart but you wake me
Wake me up from the snow
Where I was born

[Chorus:]
Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
I feed you my love

You put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say for cowards there's no reward
Feel the heat
Take my hand I trust your word
Bring the fire, I don't care if it hurts
I have the future, on my tongue
Give me a kiss

[Chorus]
Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
You might also likeYou put a knife against my back
And you dare me to face the attack
You say for cowards there's no reward
I have the future on my tongue

Now I can see
The whole world is mine
I can touch and feel
So I feed you my love
Feed you my love
So I feed you my love
