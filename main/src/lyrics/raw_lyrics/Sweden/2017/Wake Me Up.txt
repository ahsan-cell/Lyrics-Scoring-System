While I slept you came in through the window
(morning sun)
I heard you whisper my name
Your voice was the singing of birds
From where I was you sounded far away
But slowly I floated towards the sound I was hearing
The sound of you whispering to me
I let go and opened my eyes
Once I let go I forget where I was
I squinted my eyes in the sun
I caught a few glimpses and everything was bright
It was you I was seeing in sunlightYou might also like
