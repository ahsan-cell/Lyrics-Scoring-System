Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad

[Chorus]
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad

[Verse 1]
This is your fault
And I don't need you anyway
Stumble out the bathroom
Stumble out your arms again
She doing crack in the room with a noose and a Backwood
The bitch still call me crazy, lil' ho, how does that work?
She got the guest house jumpin' up with smoke out the attic
You're right, I know we love to argue, let's get at it
Wasted, sippin' on that liquor, you can taste it
Girl, don't touch that drink, I know you laced it
I don't know what to say except you're
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You crush my heart and say it's nothing
You broke me down, I kept on cutting
I bleed for you and now I'm gushing
I bleed for you, but you never cared

[Chorus]
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad

[Verse 2]
Fo' sho'
Tell me give it up, I'll leave everyone in the cold
All I wanna say, I'll do anything you condone
You show me heroin, I'll shoot it through my motherfuckin' bones
She doing crack in the room with a noose and a Backwood
The bitch still call me crazy, lil' ho, how does that work?
She got the guest house jumpin' up with smoke out the attic
You're right, I know we love to argue, let's get at it
[Pre-Chorus]
You crush my heart and say it's nothing
You broke me down, I kept on cutting
I bleed for you and now I'm gushing
I bleed for you, but you never cared

[Chorus]
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad
Spit in my face, my love, it won't phase me
Spit in my face, my love, it won't change me
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone crazy
Spit in my face, my love, I've gone mad8
