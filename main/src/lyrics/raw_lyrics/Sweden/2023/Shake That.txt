[Verse: IShowSpeed]
When I hop on this shit, and I'm droppin' a six in the back and I rock my Vans
I get in my chill and I swear to God, admit it, I better not put that on friend
Niggas up wit' a chop where the stick stay
Niggas up wit' a chop on a mean man
Wanna chop, wanna stop, wanna speed?
Nigga, stop what you talk, wanna feel like a bee?
Back wit' a chop, niggas on scare t'day
Rich, I wanna feel like a belay
Rich, I wanna feel like a relay
Jump on that shit and I feel like a relay
Race, race
Niggas is puttin' up stakes, stakes
Niggas on crack, on the bay, bay
Bangin' the D's and I'm fuckin' the delay, choppa, let's play
Ride, ride, ride to the muhfuckin' Vertt, Vertt
Tryna tell me that I'm MCVertt, Vertt
Wanna chop on the top of the cop car
Niggas wan' chop and I feel like a wor-word
Ayy, wanna hop on a jersey?
Niggas on dicks, so I gotta get sturdy
Niggas don't want but I gotta get, buddy
I gotta get dizzy, I gotta get it started
I hop on the chop, running up on the gang
Niggas on dick, man, I feel like the rain
Nigga vibe with a chop, wanna feel like a name?
Wanna chop, wanna feel like a bang?
Bang, bang, bang
Bang my speed, speed, speed
Makin' you see, see, see
Like fuck do you mean, mean, mean?
Back in the grade, didn't know what to do
Niggas O.D. but I bump in the stu' (Ah)
But I'm on my step, when I walk in the crew
Like fuck it, you know, what the chop gonna do
And I'm screaming out "Speed gang!"
Nah, nigga, Speed gang!
Wanna hop on this shit
Want to chop with a feel
Man, I'm feeling like a rename (What? What?)
I feel like gorilla, my nigga, my trues are now really now fuller than niggas, I feel like a bed (Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf)
Put in more cheese I'm not built like a bitter nigga, shoot better
Sure about who did you shoot, like what? (Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf)
Like what? Like what? (Arf, arf, arf, arf)
I said now it's what (Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf)
Now what, now what, what, what, what? (Arf, arf, arf, arf, arf, arf)
