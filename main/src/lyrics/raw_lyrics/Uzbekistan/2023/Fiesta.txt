I’ll make her Say Aah, but I’ll never say “I do”
She on the low trying to make J rise (J-Reyez) and make Thai food
She got a thing for showrunners, a fetish like no wonder
She ain’t loyal but am I gon fuck her? I’m Shogunna (sure gonna)
If she single I can flip her over to her B-side
She swallowed her integrity and showed my D pride (D-Pryde)
Dumbfoundead by her ho-ish ways, said she love my singing voice
Promiscuous but want me to hit without a Jimmy, boy (JimmyBoi)
Not to be trusted, I ain’t got a lot to tell her
So I do the dame and dash (Damon Dash) before she can rock a fella (Rocafella)
With lies and broken promises pre-rehearsed if she G’s you first
Or even worse, when she need a purse, to measure and see your worth

Chorus:
When a rich brother want you (want you babe)
And your man just can’t do nothing for you (nothing, no)
These hoes ain’t loyal (2x)

Verse 2:
Girl if I got rich, would you wanna be my down-ass chick (like right away)
Girl if I blew up, would you come follow?
I know girl…with me, you do things you won’t with your man
On the low-low girl, with your legs in the air, you never stood a chance
C’mon, c’mon girl why you frontin
Baby, show me something
When I call her, she gon’ leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon cheat
You might also likeChorus (2x)

Verse 3:
C’mon, c’mon girl why you frontin
Baby, show me something
When I call her, she gon’ leave
And I bet that bottom dollar she gon cheat
C’mon, c’mon girl why you frontin
Baby, show me something
You done spent your bread on her
And it’s all for nothing

Chorus1
