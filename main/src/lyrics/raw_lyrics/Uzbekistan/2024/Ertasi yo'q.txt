Crook's Corner question of the day. Can you name me five brothers, not three not four, five brothers in the rap game today, that can fuck with Family Bvsiness lyrically? Name me five brothers that can fuck with Family Bvsiness lyrically. Can you do it? Drop a comment

[Verse 1: Demetrius]
Fuck your Mount Rushmore, we amount to much more
Why you think these rappers with powers don't vouch for us for?
We can change the balance of power and make your fans into ours Your favorite rapper's a coward now and in uproar
We stressing niggas, it's weighing heavy on they conscience, I Mean that bread we put on they head my nigga
We got 'em shook, the new Pac and Suge of the west, my nigga
That's Bishop and Knight - we playing chess with niggas
The new and the old school goats can soak when Goku brewing a goat stew, who wanna go through me? I'll eat the holy ghost - That truly is soul food
You and your whole crew can get slow brewed
Women and gentleman tremble the minute the villain is feeling Adrenaline, nigga remember? I told you
D-dying of thirst, I thirst to see these goats die and lie in the dirt
Wanna see a dead body? Yea somebody got murked, but this Sead body's your entire body of work
Give me a beat that's this hypnotic and I can reinvent the Chronic Or I can tweak Pac's philosophies and reinvent his logic
Or I can teach Socrates and I can teach the Konstantin, copy Jesus From Egypt and why believing it is nonsense
I have rewritten The Qu'ran and I have remixed Islamic teachings, Elijah Muhammad rhyming in Ebonics
That's how I'm preaching, he is the god, Amun-Ra combined with The the Dalai Lama even
'Cause I lift the llama like a dolly when it's time for drama season

[Verse 2: Julius]
Ooh shit, goddamn, that's fire breathing, no son of Tip but I'm a Major king, a messiah, even
All eyes on us like Seinfeld in the final season, before my circle retire we gon' make our mark like tires screeching
They say a new group has risen be warned, nah my nigga we Been a group ever since Kenny was born
My clique don't need bait online, we like internet porn
A god in physical form, my crown assembled from thorns, yea
Man it seem like every time I put the pen to the page poison leaks Out as if my hand was bit by venomous snake
Freedom writer, no Hilary Swank, I go hard, the shit I write is Rough, they want me to lighten up like Mike Jack wait a minute I Say
Lighten up and since my lyrical abilities ain't limited, wait, let's Switch the simile eh?
These motherfuckers want me to lighten up like Fresh Prince's Vivian Banks but I'm a spartan like Gerald Butler or Michigan State
We the illest, fuck if your clique receive Grammy's, you disagree? Hop in my Twitter mentions, please @ me
I'm in the streets come scream at me, rifle rest on my collarbone, Lion on my shoulder like I'm Prince Akeem daddy mm!
My third optic is a vessel of knowledge, my mind is far from a cage It never been locked in
Just bury me in ocean with my ancestors who jumped from the Ships 'cause they knew death was better than bondage

Word
I'm trouble bringin', I'm out here flipping homonyms, that mean I'ma belt you until you buckle, the double meanings
I'm flipping homonyms for no reason, I'm flipping like somersault 'Cause they're both seasons, peep me
When I peel that banana clip you slip in a coma, that banana will Split you, when it hit you that nigga's a goner
On the floor is where they found you 'cause the gun had just put you on punishment and ground you, who want smoke? The stick is A stoner
The pistol's just the artistic kind, drawing you then erase you without a trace, call it a stencil nine, keeping you pricks in line
Fix your attitude 'cause I ain't fixing mine, prolly think I clubbed You with a venue after I strike you with this picket sign
Keep fucking with Dominick, and you gon' be calling me daddy as Soon as your mama get dick in the fatherless twat I promise the Plot'll twist
I tell you in confidence your mama just use a bottomless Esophagus to start swallowing sausages like lozenges
Said every drop was innocuous, I'ma give her props for the Compliments, you get the point like a monument, I mean the top Of the Obelisk
No matter the continent I conquer it, just give me the throne, Everywhere a nigga roam I'm Romulus, right?
The obvious god of this rhyming shit but I'm watching this game Shocked in astonishment, dropping this bomb on top of this Metrosexual populace, and its androgynous occupants
I call it accomplishments, that and seeing money like an economist mixed with an optometrist
I'm in this bitch to bring your crews death, after the war we won't Know who's right just who's left
Goat stew, us five rappers are cannibals, Nat Geo don't make us Channel the animal

[Verse 4: Kenny]
As far as weed goes, I heart the best shit, when I say the gram it's Not a app for net flicks
But that five star gas that'll pick you up while you feeling stuck Give you the best lift, (?) the rest wish
I've known for the dough, dash from hoes they full of games like App stores in the phone
So I find an amazing tender and grind her with no title right on the Spot if I could poke 'em and go
But that was due to my addiction, my condition, my conflictions, I Had to apply restrictions and fight for a higher mission to write With the right precision
I am driven, I have risen, time to get it, I got rid of the weight like a Dietitian uh
Like O'Shea with NWA albums I knew I'd write and it would be Easy to make thousands
Wanted to exhibit bars, be as big as Alvin, when I was young like That Andre that brought us Calvin
A couple of niggas are trying to come in and start hustling with us 'Cause
The minute they figure the money is doubling niggas'll switch it up
But we ain't running with none of you niggas we running in front Of you niggas
You fuckers can never keep up with my niggas we hustling 'till we Rich as fuck
They wanna hang with the gang who won't change for the fame, We won't perish from this game like the name of Lesane
They say they lit like we are, I'm doubtful, you niggas extra extra I Can read all about you
[Verse 5: Dice]
Family Bvsiness we the greatest ever
We prey on MC's, a family that prays together stay together
Multiply Ice Cube in his rapping prime, we five O'Shea Jacksons Call us The Jackson 5
You niggas a little shook like you just been in a aftershock, we Can't be stopped, us ghetto boys rap a lot coming to snatch your Spot
Pulling up with the stick might wanna back up from this staff I got
A couple of blocka blockas, my artillery fucking up half your block
Hold on, ignorance is fucking bliss, that mean you happy rappers Don't know who you fucking with
You lean on strangers, you don't know who you up against, like Sex with gonorrhea my niggas is fucking lit
Every great rap group is a certain kind of beast, so if you Crossbreed Tha Dogg Pound with a little Mobb Deep
With the offspring of every rapper that inspired me, you still won't Get us we a different breed entirely
