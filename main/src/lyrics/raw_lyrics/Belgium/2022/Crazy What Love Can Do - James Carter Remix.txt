[Verse 1: Becky Hill]
Wrap me up in diamonds, cover me in gold
But nothing they could buy me made my heart whole
I'd given up on romance, then I found you
Ain’t it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do

[Refrain: Becky Hill]
Can someone tell me what is happening to me?
You're my oxygen, now I can finally breathe
Didn't care for anyone until there was you
Ain’t it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do

[Chorus: Ella Henderson, Becky Hill]

Da-da-da-do-do
Dun-dun-dun-da-do-do
Ain't it crazy what love can do?
Crazy what love can do
