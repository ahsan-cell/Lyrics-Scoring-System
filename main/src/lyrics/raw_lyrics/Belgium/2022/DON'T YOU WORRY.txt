Everything's gonna be alright

[Verse 1: will.i.am, will.i.am & Shakira, Shakira, apl.de.ap, (apl.de.ap & Shakira)]
It's gon' be al-, be alright, thumbs up vibe
Ready for the night, lit like a light
'Bout to take a flight, get higher than a kite
Floatin' on the sky, look mama, I can fly
I feel so alive, I'ma live my best life
Do just, do just what I like
Get that, get that, get that press
I was down now I (rise up)
Head up and my (eyes up)
I keep getting (wiser)
Then I realize (that everything will be)

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am & Shakira, Shakira]
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-kay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay, okay
This is how we do it, baby, this is what we say
Eso es lo que tú y yo vamo' a hacer
