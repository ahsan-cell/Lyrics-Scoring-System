(Drop down to the floor)
(Drop down to the floor)

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Tonight we gonna drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
I'm gonna party, don't care what nobody say
If you ain't coming, better get out of the way
AM to PM from New York to Saint Tropez
Just drop it, drop it every night and day

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
Drop down to the floor
Blowing out the speaker through the walls
Gonna get ya coming right back for more
Tonight we gonna drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop
