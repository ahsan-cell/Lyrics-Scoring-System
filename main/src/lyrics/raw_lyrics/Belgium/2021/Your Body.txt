This is a certified hood classic
Luvvy Duvvy

[Hook]
Got the blade, on my waist
Got like 10 racks in the safe
Got like 10 girls in my face
Lick the blood I love the taste
Let my goth girl hold the blade
Talking down you catch a fade
Yeah I heard you throwing shade
Ima put you in a grave

[Bridge]
I don’t need her anyway man she can leave I need no help
I don’t care bout what they say man screw the peace it won’t end well
White girl look like Mary Kate make that boy bleed send you to hell
They can call me any day thеn with the speed take off your shell

[Verse 1]
Got thе knife, in my sock
It can make your body rock
This song smacking like The Rock
I pulled up on your buddy block
I stabbed him he was left in shock, Blood lover know I won’t stop
Emo headed to the top, I’m at the spot, Make bodies drop
You was talking to the cops, I’m at your dot get me the mop
I might catch you at the shop, leave you to rot I got the Glock
.44 it go pop-pop you drop-drop its on lock
Choppa make you get back, no kickback I hit that
You a walking target can’t miss that get the racks
Designers on me mismatch, I flip that, get it backYou might also like
