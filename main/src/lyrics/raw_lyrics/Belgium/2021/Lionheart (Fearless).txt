Heart, heart, heart, heart
Heart, heart, a lionheart

[Chorus]
To be fearless like a lionheart (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
And I feel it in my blood (Blood, blood, blood, blood)
Like the stars that illuminate the sky
There's a fire in my lungs burnin' tonight
And I'm fearless like a lionheart (Heart, heart, a lionheart)

[Post-Chorus]
(Heart, heart, heart, heart)
(Heart, heart) A lionheart

[Verse]
Oh, I look in the mirror
Teardrops in my eyes
Makes it hard to see clearer
Lookin' for a sign tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, I wanna know
I wanna know what it feels like
To wake up like a giant
I wanna know what it feels like
You might also like[Chorus]
To be fearless like a lionheart (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
And I feel it in my blood (Blood, blood, blood, blood)
Like the stars that illuminate the sky
There's a fire in my lungs burnin' tonight
And I'm fearless like a lionheart (Heart, heart, a lionheart)

[Post-Chorus]
(Heart, heart, heart, heart)
(Heart, heart) A lionheart

[Bridge]
I can feel it (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
I can feel it (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
I can feel it (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
I can feel it (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
(Heart, heart, heart, heart)
(Heart, heart) A lionheart

[Chorus]
To be fearless like a lionheart (Heart, heart, heart, heart)
And I feel it in my blood (Blood, blood, a lionheart)
Like the stars that illuminate the sky
There's a fire in my lungs burnin' tonight
And I'm fearless like a lionheart (Heart, heart, a lionheart)29
