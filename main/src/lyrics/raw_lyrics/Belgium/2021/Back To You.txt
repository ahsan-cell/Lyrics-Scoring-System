I heard a million tales before I came to you
One after the other said, "Time's the only cure"
When love is forever gone
It disappeared like stars at dawn
And every road that I've been on

[Chorus: Elley Duhé]
It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you

[Drop: Lost Frequencies]

[Verse 2: Elley Duhé & Sam Harris]
I walked a million miles before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head, sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddеst song
But it was nothing until you came along
'Cause evеry road that I've been on

[Chorus: Elley Duhé & Sam Harris, Elley Duhé]
Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you
It leads me back to you

[Verse 3: Sam Harris, with Elley Duhé]
I saw the million lines before I came to you
Guess none of us could read the lie behind the golden truth
Trust can't be counted on; it's as crooked as the Amazon
'Cause every road that I've been on
You might also like[Chorus: Elley Duhé & Sam Harris, Elley Duhé]
It leads me back to you
It leads me back to you

[Bridge: Elley Duhé, Elley Duhé & Sam Harris]
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I've been looking for trouble, trouble
I'm looking for you

[Verse 2: Elley Duhé & Sam Harris]
I walked a million miles before I came to you
Heaven wide above my head, sand beneath my shoes
Life is the saddest song
But it was nothing until you came along
'Cause every road that I've been on

[Chorus: Elley Duhé & Sam Harris]
Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you
Leads me back to you

[Outro: Elley Duhé & Sam Harris]
Every road that I've been on
It leads me back to you
