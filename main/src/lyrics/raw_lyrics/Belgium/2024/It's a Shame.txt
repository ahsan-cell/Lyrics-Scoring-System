Look at you you just a fool
Not worried about what others do
Don't care bout children getting shot
Just taking care of the money got
I remember when you were real
Talking about how you really feel
Then you went and struck that deal
Feel like now you cheat lie steal

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
I keep on falling in and out of love
With you
I never loved someone, the way that I loved you

[Verse 2: Smaka-G]
I still listen hoping you'll go back
To talking of days where you were poor or black
Now your color wheel only knows of green
You talk like that's the only one you've seen
Forgot about the days of old
When your grill got stole no we not talking gold
Your soul was rich when you were broke
Got a taste of fame and your rich soul choked
Ironic huh, It's like a joke
One that you rarely think, and never spoke of
Why should you man, people love you?
After years of bottom you got to climb through
But don't forget what got you there
It was the strife and the loss of cared
Shady dudes banging on the door
To hide the fear you dreamed of being on tour

I keep on falling in and out of love
With you
I never loved someone, the way that I loved you

[Verse 3: Smaka-G]
You really proud of what you've become?
I looked up to you like father, son
Now I've matured and you've gotten dumber
You're teeming with shit like you need a plumber
All this talk about your personal gain
Not about what millions can't obtain
So I showed up to let them know
It's not about the money, cars and hoes
It's about what's deep inside the heart and mind
And what's affecting all of mankind
Respect the past and embrace the future
Live your life like you got a tumor
It's a shame no one will hear this song
The music biz has got it wrong
Unknowns spitting thick and genuine
While big shots see through like gelatin
I'm not one to call out names
But I'm talking to you Soulja, Waka, and Wayne
You've given the rap game a bad name
It's a shame, without fame, you'd feel your hearts flame
But now the light has gone dark
And greed has replaced the warm spark
So thanks to you, and saviors like Cole, Cudi, Lup, I can't make my mind up about rap and now I'm...

I keep on falling in and out of love
With you
I never loved someone, the way that I loved you
