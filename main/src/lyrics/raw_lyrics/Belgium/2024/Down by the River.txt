I see them everywhere I go
Holding hands in the park
As the sky grows dark
Young lovers don't want to go home

Young lovers, young lovers, young lovers
They drive me right out of my mind
Lying down by the river
Whispering 'forever'
Young lovers, they don't have very long

Everybody was a young lover once
See that old man coming down the road, shuffling on a stick
Once he pressed a girl against a fence and drank her kiss
And never knew such tenderness
And holds still in his head that bliss
Now he has to sit down to take a piss

Young lovers, young lovers, young lovers
They seem to get younger every year
Find a job, get a loan
Raise some kids 'til they're grown
Young lovers, they don't have very long
Young lovers don't know what's coming onYou might also like
