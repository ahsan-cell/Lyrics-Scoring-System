See yourself through my eyes
Oh my love, I've gone too far out tonight
Out on a ledge
I'll never stop loving who I think you are
Some things never change
Oh my darling, you should hear me tonight
Wherever you are

I don't know which one of us I'm betting on
I try and tried, don't get anywhere
When we peel back layers
We might just wanna put them back on
Tonight I'd give my left arm to be with you

Oh my darling, how am I here and you've gone?
Or is it the other way around?
Oh this one time I'm not playing tonight
Because I wanna win too much

Why do we never have what we need when we have it?
If I knew that then I'd have it all
It changes, they change with every new day's dawn
For once I wish I knew what I had

Oh my darling, you're out beyond oceans and stars
But I'll find you
You might also likeBet you no one's told you you were beautiful in a long time
Like most of us we need to hear that sometimes
Like a cat always looking for somewhere to die
You always seem to land on your feet

Oh my darling, the past is with me tonight
I found you
Oh my love, you forget who you are
Maybe you never knew
Oh my beauty, you hide beyond oceans and stars
But what a view

Oh my love
I'm convinced that you are never there
Oh my darling, we're so near and so far
Always
Oh my love, I'm sure you feel that I
Was never there
Oh my darling, you should see me tonight
Couldn't love you more
Oh my love, can you hear me tonight
Wherever you are ?2
