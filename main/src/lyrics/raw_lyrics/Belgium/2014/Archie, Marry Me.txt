You've expressed explicitly your contempt for matrimony
You've student loans to pay and will not risk the alimony
We spend our days locked in a room, content inside a bubble
And in the nighttime, we go out and scour the streets for trouble
[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie

[Verse 2]
During the summer, take me sailing out on the Atlantic
I won't set my sights on other seas, there is no need to panic
So honey, take me by the hand and we can sign some papers
Forget the invitations, floral arrangements and bread makers
[Chorus]
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie
Hey, hey
Marry me, Archie

[Bridge]
Too late to go out
Too young to stay in
They're talking about
Us living in sin
