Life goes flashing by, lifts me off my feet
Broken wings don't fly, I can't breathe
You know that I need you
You smile and it pulls me through
Spinning out of time, falling far too deep
You're my perfect sky, sets me free
You know that I need you
You smile and it pulls me through

[Chorus: Leo Stannard, Leo Stannard & Frances]
Whenever I feel far from home
Facing the world on my own
You are the calm in my storm
You are the light
You are the light that's guiding me
The only one I see
The only one I need
You're my gravity

[Verse 2: Frances]
Waves come crashing in, I can't find my feet
There you walk behind holding me
You know that I need you
You smile and it pulls me through
You might also like[Chorus: Leo Stannard & Frances]
Whenever I feel far from home
Facing the world on my own
You are the calm in my storm
You are the light
You are the light that's guiding me
The only one I see
The only one I need
You're my gravity
You're my gravity
You're my gravity
You're my gravity

[Bridge: Leo Stannard, Frances]
Whenever I feel far from home
You are the calm in my storm

[Chorus: Leo Stannard & Frances, Leo Stannard]
Whenever I feel far from home
Facing the world on my own
You are the calm in my storm
You are the light
You are the light that's guiding me
The only one I see
The only one I need
You're my gravity
You're my gravity
You're my gravity
