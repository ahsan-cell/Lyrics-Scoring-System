Hey, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Baby]
We done came too far for this, I'm so tired of arguing
It's too late for X and O's, I don't want no part in this
Whenever you get mad
I always leave and give you the silent treatment
You know in your heart, I'm decent
Everything you buy, you keep it
We can still be friends
If you don't get dumb and try to tell our secrets
I know one day, you'll see all the simple shit I tried to teach you
I know it get worse 'cause nowadays, I hardly ever greet you
It was nice to meet you

[Verse 2: Kiana Ledé]
We went from 2 a.m. calls to zero communication, yeah
We spent too long in heaven that we felt the elevation
Just 'cause it's different and we're not the same
Doesn't mean things have to change
I got no trouble with my pride, got trouble cutting ties

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I don't wanna be your ex
We're way too good at being friends
Can we still hang out, on the low, get wild?
I don't wanna be your, I don't wanna be your
Hit ya girl up with a text
When you're alone and feeling stressed
I don't gotta be in love with you, to love you
I don't wanna be your, so don't treat me like your
E-e-e-e, e-e-ex
I don't wanna be your
E-e-e-e, e-e-ex

Let's skip the awkward run-ins, or
Pretending like we're strangers
And get back to how we started, yeah
Don't pour water on fire
Just 'cause it's different and we're not the same
Doesn't mean things have to change
I got no trouble with my pride
Got trouble cutting ties

[Bridge: Kiana Ledé]
I don't wanna be your ex
We're way too good at being friends
Can we still hang out on the low, get wild?
I don't wanna be your, I don't wanna be your

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I don't wanna be your ex
We're way too good at being friends
Can we still hang out, on the low, get wild?
I don't wanna be your, I don't wanna be your
Hit ya girl up with a text
When you're alone and feeling stressed
I don't gotta be in love with you, to love you, love you
I don't wanna be your, so don't treat me like your
E-e-e-e, e-e-ex
I don't wanna be your
E-e-e-e, e-e-ex
E-e-e-e, e-e-ex
I don't wanna be your
E-e-e-e, e-e-ex1
