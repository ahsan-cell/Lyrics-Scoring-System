Wish I could start it over
Baby I need you over
Wish I could taste, kiss you down by your waist
He treats you wrong
Wish I could show you love
Wish I could make you know it
Baby, you need to know it

[Pre-Chorus]
Where do you go every time I touch you there?
Whispering love, ain't nobody gotta hear
He lost control, does he even know you here
Nobody knows, I just keep it in my head

[Chorus]
I don't say too much
(Baby, baby, yeah)
I'm just here to touch
(Baby, baby, yeah) Baby
I don't say too much
(Baby, baby, yeah)
I'm just here to touch
(Baby, baby, yeah) Baby
I'm just here to touch
(Ah na-na-na na na)
(Ah na-na-na na na)
Here to touch
(Ah na na na na na)
Baby
I'm just here to touch
(Ah na-na-na darling)
(Ah na-na-na na na)
Here to touch
(Ah na-na-na na na)
Baby
I'm just here to touch
(Pull up!)
