Cut my heart about one, two times
Don't need to question the reason I'm yours, I'm yours
I'd move the Earth and lose the fight just to see you smile
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Jonas]
I'm not tryna be your part-time lover
Sign me up for that full-time, I'm yours, all yours

[Chorus: Joe Jonas]
So what a man gotta do? What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta say? What a man gotta pray
To be your last Good night and your first Good day?
So what a man gotta do? What a man gotta do
To be totally locked up by you?
What a man gotta do? What a man gotta prove
To be totally locked up by you?

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
You ain't tryna be wastin' time
On stupid people and cheap lines, I'm sure, I'm sure
So I'd give a million dollars just for you to grab me by the collar
And knock on these doors, these doors
