Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day

[Verse 1]
I will find the time, we will find the timing
'Cause you are on my mind, I hope that you don't mind it
You know that I want you, you know that I want you next to me
But if you need some space I will step away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it might sound stupid but for me, yeah, yeah
I just gotta keep believing and I've heard

[Chorus]
Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Just say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Just say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day

[Verse 2]
I promise that I'll try, that I will try to meet someone
And there's so many guys, you told me I deserve someone
I wanna call you up but maybe it will only make it worse
I guess that I just don't know what to do with myself
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know it might sound stupid but for me, yeah, yeah
I just gotta keep believing and I've heard

[Chorus]
Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Just say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Just say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Just say you'll love me one day
Oh-oh-oh, oooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Just say you'll love me one day

[Chorus]
Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Just say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Some say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
Just say you will love me one day
And I will wait, I will wait to get your loving one day
[Outro]

Just say you'll love me one day
Oh-oh-oh, oooh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
You'll love me one day1
