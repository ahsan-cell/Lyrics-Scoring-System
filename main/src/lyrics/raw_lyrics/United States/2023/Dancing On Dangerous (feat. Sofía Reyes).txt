Ready with the crazy love, it ain't strange to us
Dancing on dangerous, Sean da Paul, Sofía, Imanbek

[Verse 1: Sean Paul & Sofía Reyes]
Crazy vibes so we livin' it dangerous
They could never be caging us
Street me say the road code contagious
Straight fire weh we blaze, high grade's a must
Oh oh, girl get insane with us
Fly high to the sky, take plane with us
No shame cause we livin' it dangerous
Hey! Cause we livin' it dangerous

[Chorus: Sofía Reyes]
We're dancing on dangerous, skipping on a wire
Dancing on dangerous, fooling with the fire
Dancing on dangеrous, jumping on the ice
Dancing on dangerous, nеver felt so right

[Post-Chorus: Sofía Reyes]
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, dancing on dangerous
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, dancing on dangerous
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, dancing on dangerous
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, dancing on dangerous, on dangerous

Two individual a send subliminal
All damn night I can see you, see me gyal
And you know seh you inna my visual
You give me the most energy fi get physical
Want you want me, me want you too
Make me know how far you want fi go
Push to the limit and let the riddim flow
Even though you feel danger, nuh let go

[Chorus: Sofía Reyes]
We're dancing on dangerous, skipping on a wire
Dancing on dangerous, fooling with the fire
Dancing on dangerous, jumping on the ice
Dancing on dangerous, never felt so right

[Post-Chorus: Sofía Reyes]
