Is there nothing in here anymore?
What are you searching for?
Each time you cut right through
And again I give myself to you
What am I going to do
With you?
With you?

No one knew where we were
And we'd laugh and live until it hurt
Craving for anyone's concern
There's no way I would not bend
And you know I'd do it all again
But my god it never ends
With you
With you

It's happening all at once
And I can't keep up
It's happening all at once
And I can't keep up
It's happening all at once
And I can't keep up
It's happening all at once
And I can't keep up
You might also likeWhen the time apart is long
And I know that you are hardly holding on
The peace I'vе found feels wrong
Yeah, each time you cut right through
And again I'll givе myself to you
What am going to do
With you?
With you?

It's happening all at once
And I can't keep up
You sent "good-bye" and I'm calling you
And I can't get through
Your lips are blue and I pick you up
I'm not fast enough
It's happening all at once
And you won't wake up
