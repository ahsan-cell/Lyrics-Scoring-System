Yeah you've been eating away
Well you're just getting a taste
Better to bite it off

Should have known what you made
Taking more than a page
Could write a book at this pace
What else could we exhaust

Can't understand as of late
Why you decided to change
But still let pieces remain
When you could have it all

Well I've been done with this game
Running around in this same old place again
And I can't seem to win

Well I've been done with this gamе
Running around in this same old place again
And I can't seem to win

Help mе ease the pain
What's the point of it
Put it all to bed
Cause we can't be friends
You might also likePut it all to bed
Cause we can't be friends

Put it all to bed
Cause we can't be friends

If you don't need us
Then what's left to accept
Know that you've been leaving me
And that's what you'll regret

Pile it up
And it'll stack to the brim
Just how easily am I to forget

Well I've been done with this game
Running around in this same old place again
And I can't seem to win

Help me ease the pain
What's the point of it
Put it all to bed
Cause we can't be friends

Well I've been done with this game
Running around in this same old place again
And I can't seem to win
Help me ease the pain
What's the point of it

Cause we can't be friends

We can't be friends

We can't be friends

If you don't need us
