Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you

[Pre-Chorus]
A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud

[Chorus]
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

[Verse 2]
Songs of desperation
I played them for you

[Pre-Chorus]
A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
(A moment, a love) A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
You might also like[Chorus]
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
And while our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
And won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender

[Outro]
A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over
A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over
A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
Won't stop 'til it's over
A moment, a love, a dream, aloud
A moment, a love, a moment, a love
Won't stop to surrender47
