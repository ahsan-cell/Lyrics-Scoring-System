I've been here looking dynamite
Alone against the wall
Girls like you give it all so cold
Talking cheap in a bathroom stall
And you look so smooth
You better tell me the truth
Would you trade me
Out for someone cool?
I know you better than you do
So put out your cigarette
And kiss me on
The lips tonight

[Chorus]
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983

[Verse 2]
I've got something that I've kept inside
And the blood is on the blade
You're there sucking on your lollipop
Like you haven't aged a day
And it ain't so pretty when you're playing cute
When your body's up against some fool
Does he feel it?
â€˜Cause I feel it
You might also like[Chorus]
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983

[Bridge]
The year I was born
I won't be ignored
So get your feet on the floor
I'm the only one
Are you afraid?
I still make you move
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back to 1983
Whoa, whoa, whoa
[Chorus]
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
Me and you
You and me
Let's go back
Let's go back
1983 is calling
I've been on my knees and crawling
Back to you
It's coming all back to me
1983
Whoa, whoa, whoa
1983
Whoa, whoa, whoa
19832
