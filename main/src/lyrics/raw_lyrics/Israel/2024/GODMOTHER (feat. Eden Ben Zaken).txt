Wait for it, maybe, they'll come around, I'm not sure
Wait for my signal, I know we'll board the same shore
Stay with me, baby, I know America's far
Safe with me, baby, I know we pray the same god
Pray for the moment we get to put away guns
Pray for the parents, and Paris, devil, long gone
Wait for their blessing of me, I keep on forgetting
They tear up faces in campuses, burn the flag, and I'm torn

[Pre-Chorus: Noga Erez]
You're too cold for my blood
There's no need to pretend
If you want me around â€” beg

[Chorus: Eden Ben Zaken]
I beg you not to leave me on my own
I swear that I loved you all along
I beg you not to leave me on my own
I swear that I loved you all along

[Verse 2: Noga Erez]
Mommy from the desert, daddy from the snow
And I am everywhere because I got nowhere to go
Mommy from the desert, daddy from the snow
And I am everywhere because I got nowhere to go
Mommy from the desert, daddy from the snow
And I am everywhere because I got nowhere to go
And when you come back knocking on my door
You'll be the one to beg and I will say, "I told you so"

I beg you not to leave me on my own
I swear that I loved you all along
I beg you not to leave me on my own
I swear that I loved you all along
