Yeah, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, oh
There's somethin' in the air
There's somethin' in the air

[Verse 1]
Now where has it been?
I mean the good old wild days
Became a bit too lame
Just take a look at my place
It's such a mess
But I'll be out of this space
As soon as you tell me where the night is

[Pre-Chorus]
You have to set up
Bring it on
Forward

[Chorus]
Yeah, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air
You might also like[Verse 2]
It's been quite of a while
Since I could experience your brightness
Now you've got a brighter smile
And I think I'm going to like it
Talkin' 'bout the better things, you know how to maximize
Everything around you will become super-sized

[Pre-Chorus]
You have to set up
Away from
What matters
And get it prepared
Forward

[Chorus]
Yeah, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air
Yeah, woah-oh
There's somethin' in the air, woah-oh

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been dreamin'
We could be the fire for this night
Can't stop
[Outro]
You have to set up
We could get so wasted if you would have come (Bring it on)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (Forward)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (Can't stop)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (You have to set up)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (Bring it on)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (Forward)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (Can't stop)
We could get so wasted if you would have come (You have to set up)11
