Ooh, my line, your line
Don't cross them lines
What you like, what I like
Why can't we both be right?
Attacking, defending
Until there's nothing left worth winning
Your pride and my pride
Don't waste my time

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
Don't wanna fight no more, I

[Verse 2]
I take from my hand, put in your hands
The fruit of all my grief
Lying down ain't easy when everyone needs pleasing
I can't get no relief
Living ain't no fun, the constant dedication
Keeping the water and power on
There ain't no money left, why can't I catch my breath?
I'm gonna work myself to death
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more, I
No, no, no, no

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Ooh, I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna fight
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more
I don't wanna fight no more25
