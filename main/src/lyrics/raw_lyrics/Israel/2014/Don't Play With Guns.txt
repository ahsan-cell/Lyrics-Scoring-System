Now Josephine, she was a loner
Her fortune of incredible lies
Her problems are now your problems
I hide a gun until the day she dies

[Chorus 1]
She said don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

[Verse 2]
Now Angie, she was a demon
She had six arms and Lucifer eyes
She always had this glow
And always made me flow

[Chorus 2]
Don't play with guns
Don't play with guns
She said don't play with guns
Don't play with guns

[Verse 3]
Made his promise
Love and all things golden from my love
She said please be kind and load my gun
Please be brave and kill for fun

She lays down with a revolver
