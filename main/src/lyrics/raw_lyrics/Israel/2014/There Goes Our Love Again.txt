There goes our love again
Forgive my heart, forgive my heart
There goes our love again
Elate my heart and take the time
That's burning at the back of my mind
'Cause I'm broken and blind
And holding up the jaw of desire
There goes our love again

[Chorus]
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
But he said 'there goes our love again'
'There goes our love again'

[Verse 2]
Home is a desperate end
Cocoon my heart, cocoon my heart
And carry me to love again
Cocoon my heart and bring me calm
Hushing out the fear and alarm
I know you're open and armed
Just trying to pick the feelings undone
'There goes our love again'

I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
But he said 'there goes our love again'
But he said 'there goes our love again'
'There goes our love again'

I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
But he said 'there goes our love again'
But he said 'there goes our love again'
'There goes our love again'

[Outro]
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home
I didn't go far, I didn't go far
I didn't go far, and I came home1
