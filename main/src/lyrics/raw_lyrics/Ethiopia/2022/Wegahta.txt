The childe that come with the knyghte,
Enoghe ther he fande.
At the mete as thay beste satte,           At the height of the feast
Come the portere fro the gate,
Saide a man was theratte
Of the Maydenlande;
Saide, "Sir, he prayes the
Off mete and drynke, for charyté;
For a messagere es he
And may nott lange stande."
The knyght badde late hym inn,
"For," he sayde, "it es no synn,
The man that may the mete wynn           who enjoys food
To gyffe the travellande."           To give to the traveler

Now the travellande man

He haylsede the knyghte as he can,           greeted
Als he satt on dese.           As; dias

And how ferre that he walde so fare,           far; travel
Withowtten any lese.           lies
He saide, "I come fro the Lady Lufamour,
That sendes me to Kyng Arthoure,
And prayes hym, for his honoure,
Hir sorowes for to sesse.           put an end to
Up resyn es a Sowdane:           Uprisen; Sultan
Alle hir landes hase he tane;           taken
So byseges he that woman

He sayse that scho may have no pese,
The lady, for hir fayrenes,           despite; beauty
And for hir mekill reches.           great wealth
"He wirkes hir full woo;           causes; woe
He dose hir sorow all hir sythe,           causes; days
And all he slaes doun rythe;           slays straight away

And scho will noghte soo.
Now hase that ilke Sowdane           same

Now es the Sowdan so wyghte,           strong
Alle he slaes doun ryghte:
Ther may no man with hym fyghte,
Bot he were kempe ryfe."           renowned warrior
Than sayde Percyvell, "I the praye,
That thou wolde teche me the waye           show
Thedir, als the gates laye,           Thither; roads lie
Withowtten any stryfe;
Mighte I mete with that Sowdan
That so dose to that woman,
Alsone he solde be slane,           Instantly
And I myghte hafe the lyfe!"           If I have life [to do it]
The messangere prayed hym mare           rather
That he wolde duell still thare:
"For I will to the Kynge fare,
Myne erandes for to say.
For then mekill sorowe me betyde,
And I lenger here habyde,           If
Bot ryghte now will I ryde,
Als so faste als I may."
The knyghte herde hym say so;
Yerne he prayes hym to too           Eagerly; take
His nyne sonnes, with hym to goo.
He nykkes hym with nay.           [Perceval] refuses
Bot so faire spekes he
That he takes of tham three,
In his felawchipe to be -
The blythere were thay.           happier

Thay ware blythe of ther bade,           these tidings
Busked tham and forthe rade;           Made themselves ready
Mekill myrthes thay made:           Much glee

He was paste bot a while -           [Perceval]; gone
The montenance of a myle -           distance
He was bythoghte of a gyle           trick
Wele werse than thay wende.           imagined
Thofe thay ware of thaire fare fayne,           journey joyful
Forthwarde was thaire cheftayne;           Ahead
Ever he sende on agayne           one back
At ilke a myle ende,           each
Untill thay ware alle gane;
Than he rydes hym allane
Als he ware sprongen of a stane,           issued; stone
Thare na man hym kende,          tells him what to do
For he walde none sold hym ken.           instruct
Forthe rydes he then,
Amanges uncouthe men           foreign
His maystres to make.           wonder; perform
Now hase Percyvell in throo           haste
Spoken with his emes twoo,           uncles
Bot never one of thoo           those
Took his knawlage.           Recognised his plan
Now in his way es he sett
That may hym lede, withowtten lett,           hindrance
Thare he and the Sowdan sall mete,
His browes to blake.           turn pale
Late we Percyvell the yynge           Leave; young
Fare in Goddes blyssynge,           To fare
And untill Arthoure the Kynge           unto
Will we agayne take.

The gates agayne we will tane:           different direction; take
The Kyng to care-bedd es gane;
For mournynge es his maste mane.           main moan
He syghes full sore.
His wo es wansome to wreke,           woe; [so] miserable; avenge
His hert es bownn for to breke,
For he wend never to speke
With Percyvell no more.
Als he was layde for to ly,           put to bed
Come the messangere on hy           in haste
With lettres fro the lady,
And schewes tham righte thare.
Afote myghte the Kyng noght stande,           On his feet
Bot rede tham thare lyggande,           But advise; lying there
And sayde, "Of thyne erande
Thou hase thyn answare."

He sayde, "Thou wote thyne ansuare:           know
The mane that es seke and sare,           man; sick; sore
He may full ill ferre fare           hardly travel for
In felde for to fyghte."
The messangere made his mone:
Saide, "Wo worthe wikkede wone!           Woe befall wicked conduct
Why ne hade I tournede and gone
Agayne with the knyghte?"
"What knyghte es that," said the Kyng,
"That thou mase of thy menynge?           speak about
In my londe wot I no lordyng           know
Es worthy to be a knyghte."
The messangere ansuerd agayne,
"Wete ye, his name es for to layne,           Know; conceal
The whethir I wolde hafe weten fayne           Although; known
What the childe highte.           was called

Thus mekill gatt I of that knyght:           much learned
His dame sonne, he said, he hight.           mother's; is called
One what maner that he was dight           called
Now I sall yow telle:
He was wighte and worthly,           manly; fine
His body bolde and borely,           goodly
His armour bryghte and blody -
Hade bene late in batell;
Blode-rede was his stede,
His akton, and his other wede;           jacket; clothing
His cote of the same hede           quality
That till a knyghte felle."           to; was befitting
Than comanded the Kyng
Horse and armes for to brynge:
"If I kan trow thi talkynge,           believe
That ilke was Percyvell."           same person

For the luffe of Percyvell,
To horse and armes thay felle;
Thay wolde no lengare ther duelle:
To fare ware thay fayne.
Faste forthe gan thay fare;
Thay were aferde full sare,
Ere thay come whare he ware,
The childe wolde be slayne.
The Kyng tase with hym knyghtis thre:           takes
The ferthe wolde hymselfe be;
Now so faste rydes hee,
May folowe hym no swayne.
The Kyng es now in his waye;
Lete hym come when he maye!
And I will forthir in my playe
To Percyvell agayne.

Go we to Percyvell agayne.
The childe paste oute on the playne,           journeyed across
Over more and mountayne,           moor
To the Maydenlande;
Till agayne the even-tyde,
Bolde bodys sawe he byde,           men
Pavelouns mekill and unryde           large; numerous
Aboute a cyté stonde.
On huntyng was the Sowdane;           Out
He lefte men many ane,           a one
Twenty score that wele kan:
Be the gates yemande -           guarding
Elleven score one the nyghte,
And ten one the daye-lighte -
Wele armyde at alle righte,           particulars
With wapyns in hande.

With thaire wapyns in thaire hande,
There will thay fight ther thay stande,
Sittande and lyggande,
Elleven score of men.
In he rydes one a rase,           in a rush
Or that he wiste where he was,           Before; knew
Into the thikkeste of the prese           crowd
Amanges tham thanne.
And up stirt one that was bolde,
Bygane his brydill to holde,
And askede whedire that he wolde           where
Make his horse to rynne.
He said, "I ame hedir come
For to see a Sowdane;
In faythe, righte sone he sall be slane,
And I myghte hym ken.           If only; see

If I hym oghte ken may,
To-morne, when it es lighte daye
Than sall we togedir playe
With wapyns unryde."           cruel
They herde that he had undirtane
For to sle thaire Sowdane.
Thay felle aboute hym, everilkane,           everyone
To make that bolde habyde.           brave one remain [for battle]
The childe sawe that he was fade,           eager for battle
The body that his bridill hade:           person; held
Even over hym he rade,
In gate there bisyde.
He stayred about hym with his spere;           thrust
Many thurgh gane he bere:           pierce
Ther was none that myght hym dere,           oppose
Percevell, that tyde.

Tide in townne who will telle,           What happened
Folkes undir his fete felle;
The bolde body Percevelle,
He sped tham to spill.           hastened
Hym thoghte no spede at his spere:           rest for
Many thurgh gane he bere,
Fonde folke in the here,           Foolish people of the enemy
Feghtyng to fill.           (i.e., they get their fill of fighting)
Fro that it was mydnyghte
Till it was even at daye-lighte,
Were thay never so wilde ne wighte,
He wroghte at his will.
Thus he dalt with his brande,           dealt blows; sword
There was none that myght hym stande           withstand
Halfe a dynt of his hande
That he stroke till.           struck

Now he strykes for the nonys,           strongly
Made the Sarazenes hede-bones
Hoppe als dose hayle-stones
Abowtte one the gres;           grass
Thus he dalt tham on rawe           in turn
Till the daye gun dawe:           dawn
He layd thaire lyves full law,           low
Als many als there was.
When he hade slayne so many men,
He was so wery by then,
I tell yow for certen,
He roghte wele the lesse           cared scarcely at all
Awther of lyfe or of dede;           death
To medis that he were in a stede           In the midst of that place
Thar he myghte riste hym in thede           he would rest himself there
A stownde in sekirnes.           moment; safety

Now fonde he no sekirnes,           safety
Bot under the walle ther he was,           Except
A faire place he hym chese,           chose for himself
And down there he lighte.
He laide hym doun in that tyde;
His stede stode hym besyde:
The fole was fayne for to byde -           glad; abide
Was wery for the fyght
Till one the morne that it was day.
The wayte appon the walle lay:           sentinel
He sawe an uggly play           fearful performance
In the place dighte;           provided
Yitt was ther more ferly:           marvel
Ther was no qwyk man left therby!           living
Thay called up the lady
For to see that sighte.

Now commes the lady to that sight,
The Lady Lufamour, the brighte;
Scho clambe up to the walle on hight
Full faste to beholde;
Hedes and helmys ther was
(I tell yow withowtten lese),           lie
Many layde one the gresse,           grass
And many schelde brode.
Grete ferly thaym thoghte
Who that wondir had wroghte,           wonder
That had tham to dede broghte,           death
That folke in the felde,
And wold come none innermare           no further inside
For to kythe what he ware,           make known
And wist the lady was thare,
Thaire warysoune to yelde.           reward; claim

Scho wold thaire warysone yelde:           their reward pay
Full faste forthe thay bihelde
If thay myghte fynde in the felde
Who hade done that dede;
Thay luked undir thair hande,
Sawe a mekill horse stande,           just below
A blody knyghte liggande           mighty
By a rede stede.
Then said the lady so brighte,
"Yondir ligges a knyghte
That hase bene in the fighte,
If I kane righte rede;
Owthir es yone man slane,
Or he slepis hym allane,
Or he in batelle es tane,
For blody are his wede."           clothes

Scho says, "Blody are his wede,
And so es his riche stede;
Siche a knyght in this thede           country
Saw I never nane.
What so he es, and he maye ryse,
He es large there he lyse,
And wele made in alle wyse,
Ther als man sall be tane."           judged
Scho calde appon hir chaymbirlayne,
Was called hende Hatlayne -
The curtasye of Wawayne           manners
He weldis in wane;
Scho badd hym, "Wende and see           Go
Yif yon man on lyfe be.           yonder; alive
Bid hym com and speke with me,
And pray hym als thou kane."           can

Now to pray hym als he kane,
Undir the wallis he wane;           goes
Warly wakend he that mane:           Cautiously awakened; man
The horse stode still.
Als it was tolde unto me,
He knelid down on his kne;
Hendely hailsed he that fre,           Courteously greeted; nobleman
And sone said hym till,
"My lady, lele Lufamour,           fair
Habyddis the in hir chambour,           Awaits you
Prayes the, for thyn honour,
To come, yif ye will."
So kyndly takes he that kyth           request
That up he rose and went hym wyth,
The man that was of myche pyth           strength
Hir prayer to fulfill.

Now hir prayer to fulfill,
He folowed the gentilmans will,
And so he went hir untill,
Forthe to that lady.
Full blythe was that birde brighte           fair lady
When scho sawe hym with syghte,
For scho trowed that he was wighte,           manly
And askede hym in hy:           questioned
At that fre gan scho frayne,           noble one; ask
Thoghe he were lefe for to layne,           eager to hide the facts
If he wiste who had tham slayne -
Thase folkes of envy.
He sayd, "I soghte none of tho;           those
I come the Sowdane to slo,           slay
And thay ne wolde noghte late me go;
Thaire lyfes there refte I."

He sayd, "Belyfe thay solde aby."           Happily; abide
And Lufamour, that lele lady,           fair
Wist ful wele therby           Knew
The childe was full wighte.           powerful
The birde was blythe of that bade           noble lady; news
That scho siche and helpe hade;           such a helper
Agayne the Sowdane was fade           Against; [he] was determined
With alle for to fighte.
Faste the lady hym byhelde:           Earnestly
Scho thoght hym worthi to welde,           govern
And he myghte wyn hir in felde,           field of battle
With maystry and myghte.
His stede thay in stabill set
And hymselfe to haulle was fet,            hall; brought
And than, withowtten any let,           delay
To dyne gun thay dighte.           prepare

The childe was sett on the dese,           high table
And served with reches -           dainties
I tell yow withowtten lese -           lie
That gaynely was get,           handsomely was served
In a chayere of golde
Bifore the fayrest, to byholde
The myldeste mayden one molde,           on earth
At mete als scho satt.
Scho made hym semblande so gude,           friendly welcome
Als thay felle to thaire fude,
The mayden mengede his mode           roused his spirits
With myrthes at the mete,
That for hir sake righte tha           then
Sone he gane undirta           undertake
The sory Sowdane to sla,
Withowtten any lett.           delay

He sayd, withowtten any lett,
"When the Sowdane and I bene mett,
A sadde stroke I sall one hym sett,           solemn
His pride for to spyll."
Then said the lady so free,
"Who that may his bon be           death (bane)
Sall hafe this kyngdome and me,
To welde at his will."
He ne hade dyned bot smalle           a little
When worde come into the haulle
That many men withalle
Were hernyste one the hill;           armed
For tene thaire felawes were slayne,           anger [that]
The cité hafe thay nere tane.           nearly taken
The men that were within the wane           stronghold
The comon-belle gun knylle.           did knell

Now knyllyn thay the comon-belle.
Worde come to Percevell,
And he wold there no lengere duelle,
Bot lepe fro the dese -           high table
Siche wilde gerys hade he mo -           impulsive ways; plenty
Sayd, "Kynsmen, now I go.
For alle yone sall I slo
Longe are I sese!"           before; cease
Scho kiste hym withowtten lett;           delay
The helme on his hede scho sett;
To the stabill full sone he gett,
There his stede was.
There were none with hym to fare;
For no man then wolde he spare! -           hold back
Rydis furthe, withowtten mare,           alone
Till he come to the prese.           Sultan's gang

When he come to the prese,
He rydes in one a rese;           in a rush
The folkes, that byfore hym was,
Thaire strenght hade thay tone;           taken
To kepe hym than were thay ware;           oppose; eager
Thaire dynttis deris hym no mare           blows harm
Then whoso hade strekyn sare           fiercely
One a harde stone.
Were thay wighte, were thay woke,           strong; weak
Alle that he till stroke,
He made thaire bodies to roke:           fall back
Was ther no better wone.           fate
I wote, he sped hym so sone
That day, by heghe none           noon
With all that folke hade he done:
One lefe lefte noghte one.           Alive

When he had slayne all tho,
He loked forthir hym fro,
If he myghte fynde any mo
With hym for to fyghte;
And als that hardy bihelde,           hardy [lad] looked about
He sese, ferre in the felde,           sees far
Fowre knyghtis undir schelde
Come rydand full righte.           vigourously
One was Kyng Arthour,
Anothir Ewayne, the floure,           most excellent
The thirde Wawayne with honoure,
And Kay, the kene knyghte.
Percevell saide, withowtten mare,
"To yondir foure will I fare;
And if the Sowdane be thare,
I sall holde that I highte."           keep; promised

Now to holde that he hase highte,
Agaynes thaym he rydis righte,
And ay lay the lady brighte
One the walle, and byhelde           On
How many men that he had slane,
And sythen gane his stede mayne           rode; poweful
Foure kempys agayne,           warriors to meet
Forthir in the felde.
Then was the lady full wo
When scho sawe hym go
Agaynes foure knyghtys tho,           To meet
With schafte and with schelde.
They were so mekyl and unryde           great; huge
That wele wende scho that tyde           time
With bale thay solde gare hym byde           grief; make
That was hir beste belde.           protector

Thofe he were beste of hir belde,           protections
As that lady byhelde,
He rydes forthe in the felde,
Even tham agayne.           Directly against
Then sayd Arthoure the Kyng,
"I se a bolde knyghte owt spryng;           charging
For to seke feghtyng,
Forthe will he frayne.           seek battle
If he fare forthe to fighte
And we foure kempys agayne one knyght,           warriors
Littill menske wold to us lighte           honour
If he were sone slayne."
They fore forthward right faste,
And sone kevells did thay caste,           lots
And evyr fell it to frayste           try
Untill Sir Wawayne.           Unto

When it felle to Sir Wawayne
To ryde Percevell agayne,           against
Of that fare was he fayne,           chance
And fro tham he rade.
Ever the nerre hym he drewe,           nearer
Wele the better he hym knewe,
Horse and hernays of hewe,
That the childe hade.
"A, dere God!" said Wawayne the fre,
"How-gates may this be?           However
If I sle hym, or he me,
That never yit was fade,           his enemy
And we are sisters sones two,           For
And aythir of us othir slo,           If
He that lifes will be full wo           lives; utterly woeful
That ever was he made."

Now no maistrys he made,           menacing gestures
Sir Wawayne, there als he rade,
Bot hovyde styll and habade           remained; stopped
His concell to ta.           take
"Ane unwyse man," he sayd, "am I,
That puttis myselfe to siche a foly;
Es there no man so hardy

Thogfe Percevell hase slayne the Rede Knight,           Although

So mote I one erthe ga,

If I may righte rede!           be well-advised
A schafte sall I one hym sett,
And I sall fonde firste to hitt;           try
Then sall I ken be my witt

No more carpys he that tyde,           debates
Bot son togedyr gon thay ryde-
Men that bolde were to byde,
And styff appon stede;
Thaire horse were stallworthe and strange,           strong
Thair scheldis were unfailande;
Thaire speris brake to thaire hande,           splintered in
Als tham byhoved nede.           As they were bound to do

Now es broken that are were hale,           ere; whole
And than bygane Percevale
For to tell one a tale
That one his tonge laye.           on
He sayde, "Wyde-whare hafe I gane;           Far and wide
Siche anothir Sowdane           Such
In faythe sawe I never nane,
By nyghte ne by daye.

Twenty score of thi men;
And of alle that I slewe then,
Me thoghte it bot a playe
Agayne that dynt that I hafe tane;           Compared to; blow
For siche one aughte I never nane           possessed
Bot I qwyte two for ane,           Unless; repay
Forsothe, and I maye."

Then spake Sir Wawayne -
Certanely, is noghte to layne -           lie
Of that fare was he fayne,           glad
In felde there thay fighte:
By the wordis so wylde
At the fole one the felde,           naïf in
He wiste wele it was the childe,

He sayse, "I ame no Sowdane,
Bot I am that ilke man           same
That thi body bygan
In armours to dighte.
I giffe the prise to thi pyth.           prize; strength
Unkyndely talked thou me with:
My name es Wawayne in kythe,           among my people
Whoso redys righte."

He sayes, "Who that will rede the aryghte,           advise you
My name es Wawayne the knyghte."
And than thay sessen of thaire fighte,           cease
Als gude frendes scholde.
He sayse, "Thynkes thou noghte when
That thou woldes the knyghte brene,
For thou ne couthe noghte ken           didn't know how
To spoyle hym alle colde?"           plunder
Bot then was Percevell the free
Als blythe als he myghte be,
For then wiste he wele that it was he,
By takens that he tolde.           details
He dide then als he gane hym lere:           had been taught
Putt up hys umbrere;           visor
And kyste togedir with gud chere
Those beryns so bolde.           warriors

Now kissede the beryns so bolde,
Sythen talkede what thay wolde.
Be then come Arthour the bolde,
That there was knyghte and kyng
Als his cosyns hadd done,
Thankede God also sone.
Off mekill myrthis thay mone
At thaire metyng.
Sythen, withowtten any bade,
To the castelle thay rade
With the childe that thay hade,
Percevell the yynge.
The portere was redy thare,
Lete the knyghtis in fare;
A blythere lady than . . .
. . . . . . . . . . . .

"Mi grete socour at thou here sende,
Off my castell me to diffende,
Agayne the Sowdane to wende,
That es my moste foo."
Theire stedis thay sett in the stalle.
The Kyng wendis to haulle;
His knyghtis yode hym with alle,
Als kynde was to go.
Thaire metis was redy,
And therto went thay in hy,
The Kyng and the lady,
And knyghtis also.

Wele welcomed scho the geste
With riche metis of the beste,
Drynkes of the derreste,
Dighted bydene.
Thay ete and dranke what thay wolde,
Sythen talked and tolde
Off othir estres full olde,
The Kyng and the Qwene.
At the firste bygynnyng,
Scho frayned Arthour the Kyng
Of childe Percevell the yyng,
What life he had in bene.
Grete wondir had Lufamour
He was so styffe in stour
And couthe so littill of nurtour
Als scho had there sene.

Scho had sene with the childe
No thyng bot werkes wylde:
Thoghte grete ferly on filde
Of that foly fare.
Then said Arthour the Kyng
Of bold Percevell techyng,
Fro the firste bygynnyng
Till that he come thar:
How his fadir was slayne,
And his modir to the wode gane
For to be there hir allane
In the holtis hare,
Fully feftene yere
To play hym with the wilde dere:
Littill wonder it were
Wilde if he ware!

When he had tolde this tale
To that semely in sale
He hade wordis at wale
To tham ilkane.
Then said Percevell the wighte,
"Yif I be noghte yitt knyghte,
Thou sall halde that thou highte,
For to make me ane."
Than saide the Kyng full sone,
"Ther sall other dedis be done,
And thou sall wynn thi schone
Appon the Sowdane."
Then said Percevell the fre,
"Als sone als I the Sowdane see,
Righte so sall it sone be,
Als I hafe undirtane."

He says, "Als I hafe undirtane
For to sla the Sowdane,
So sall I wirke als I kanne,
That dede to bygynn."
That day was ther no more dede
With those worthily in wede,
Bot buskede tham and to bedde yede,
The more and the mynn;
Till one the morne erely
Comes the Sowdane with a cry,
Fonde all his folkes hym by
Putt into pyn.
Sone asked he wha
That so durste his men sla,
And wete hym one lyfe gaa,
The maystry to wynn.

Now to wynn the maystry,
To the castell gan he cry,
If any were so hardy,
The maistry to wynn:
"A man for ane,
Thoghe he hadd all his folke slane,
Here sall he fynde Golrotherame
To mete hym full ryghte,
Appon siche a covenande
That ye hefe up your hande;
Who that may the better stande
And more es of myghte
To bryng that other to the dede,
Browke wele the londe on brede
And hir that is so faire and rede,
Lufamour the brighte!"

Then the Kyng Arthour
And the Lady Lufamour
And all that were in the towre
Graunted therwith.
Thay called Percevell the wight;
The Kyng doubbed hym to knyghte.
Thofe he couthe littill insighte,
The childe was of pith.
He bad he solde be to prayse,
Therto hende and curtayse;
Sir Percevell the Galayse
Thay called hym in kythe.
Kyng Arthour in Maydenlande
Dubbid hym knyghte with his hande,
Bad hym ther he his fo fande
To gyff hym no grythe.

Grith takes he nane:
He rydes agayne the Sowdane
That highte Gollerotherame,
That felle was in fighte.
In the felde so brade,
No more carpynge thay made,
Bot sone togedir thay rade,
Theire schaftes to righte.
Gollerotheram, thofe he wolde wede,
Percevell bere hym fro his stede
Two londis one brede,
With maystry and myghte.
At the erthe the Sowdane lay;
His stede gun rynn away;
Than said Percevell one play,
"Thou haste that I the highte."

He sayd, "I highte the a dynt,
And now, me thynke, thou hase it hynt.
And I may, als I hafe mynt,
Thou schalt it never mende."
Appon the Sowdan he duelled
To the grownde ther he was felled,
And to the erthe he hym helde
With his speres ende.
Fayne wolde he hafe hym slayne,
This uncely Sowdane,
Bot gate couthe he get nane,
So ill was he kende.
Than thynkes the childe
Of olde werkes full wylde:
"Hade I a fire now in this filde,
Righte here he solde be brende."

He said, "Righte here I solde the brene,
And thou ne solde never more then
Fighte for no wymman,
So I solde the fere!"
Then said Wawayne the knyghte,
"Thou myghte, and thou knewe righte,
And thou woldes of thi stede lighte,
Wynn hym one were."
The childe was of gamen gnede;
Now he thynkes one thede,
"Lorde! whethir this be a stede
I wende had bene a mere?"
In stede righte there he in stode,
He ne wiste nother of evyll ne gude,
Bot then chaunged his mode
And slaked his spere.

When his spere was up tane,
Then gan this Gollerothiram,
This ilke uncely Sowdane,
One his fete to gete.
Than his swerde drawes he,
Strykes at Percevell the fre.
The childe hadd no powsté
His laykes to lett.
The stede was his awnn will:
Saw the swerde come hym till,
Leppe up over an hill,
Fyve stryde mett.
Als he sprent forby,
The Sowdan keste up a cry;
The childe wann owt of study
That he was inn sett.

Now ther he was in sett,
Owt of study he gett,
And lightis downn, withowtten lett,
Agaynes hym to goo.
He says, "Now hase thou taughte me
How that I sall wirke with the."
Than his swerde drawes he
And strake to hym thro.
He hitt hym even one the nekk-bane,
Thurgh ventale and pesane.
The hede of the Sowdane
He strykes the body fra.
Then full wightly he yode
To his stede, there he stode;
The milde mayden in mode,
Mirthe may scho ma!

Many mirthes then he made;
In to the castell he rade,
And boldly he there habade
With that mayden brighte.
Fayne were thay ilkane
That he had slane the Sowdane
And wele wonn that wymman,
With maystry and myghte.
Thay said Percevell the yyng
Was beste worthy to be kyng,
For wele withowtten lesyng
He helde that he highte.
Ther was no more for to say,
Bot sythen, appon that other day,
He weddys Lufamour the may,
This Percevell the wighte.


Now hase Percevell the wight
Wedded Lufamour the bright,
And is a kyng full righte
Of alle that lande brade.
Than Kyng Arthour in hy
Wolde no lengare ther ly:
Toke lefe at the lady.
Fro tham than he rade:
Left Percevell the yyng
Off all that lande to be kyng,
For he had with a ryng
The mayden that it hade. 4
Sythen, appon the tother day,
The Kyng went on his way,
The certane sothe, als I say,
Withowtten any bade.

Now than yong Percevell habade
In those borowes so brade
For hir sake, that he hade
Wedd with a ryng.
Wele weldede he that lande,
Alle bowes to his honde;
The folke, that he byfore fonde,
Knewe hym for kyng.
Thus he wonnes in that wone
Till that the twelmonthe was gone,
With Lufamour his lemman.
He thoghte on no thyng,
Now on his moder that was,
How scho levyde with the gres,
With more drynke and lesse,
In welles, there thay spryng.

Drynkes of welles, ther thay spryng,
And gresse etys, withowt lesyng!
Scho liffede with none othir thyng
In the holtes hare.
Till it byfelle appon a day,
Als he in his bedd lay,
Till hymselfe gun he say,
Syghande full sare,
"The laste Yole-day that was,
Wilde wayes I chese:
My modir all manles
Leved I thare."
Than righte sone saide he,
"Blythe sall I never be
Or I may my modir see,
And wete how scho fare."

Now to wete how scho fare,
The knyght busked hym yare;
He wolde no lengare duelle thare
For noghte that myghte bee.
Up he rose in that haulle,
Tuke his lefe at tham alle,
Both at grete and at smalle;
Fro thaym wendis he.
Faire scho prayed hym even than,
Lufamour, his lemman,
Till the heghe dayes of Yole were gane,
With hir for to bee.
Bot it served hir of no thyng:
A preste he made forthe bryng,
Hym a messe for to syng,
And aftir rode he.

Now fro tham gun he ryde;
Ther wiste no man that tyde
Whedirwarde he wolde ryde,
His sorowes to amende.
Forthe he rydes allone;
Fro tham he wolde everichone:
Mighte no man with hym gone,
Ne whedir he wolde lende.
Bot forthe thus rydes he ay,
The certen sothe als I yow say,
Till he come at a way
By a wode-ende.
Then herde he faste hym by
Als it were a woman cry:
Scho prayed to mylde Mary
Som socoure hir to sende.

Scho sende hir socour full gude,
Mary, that es mylde of mode.
As he come thurgh the wode,
A ferly he fande.
A birde, brighteste of ble,
Stode faste bonden till a tre -
I say it yow certanly -
Bothe fote and hande.
Sone askede he who,
When he sawe hir tho,
That had served hir so,
That lady in lande.
Scho said, "Sir, the Blake Knyghte
Solde be my lorde with righte;
He hase me thusgates dighte
Here for to stande."

She says, "Here mon I stande
For a faute that he fande
That sall I warande
Is my moste mone.
Now to the I sall say:
Appon my bedd I lay
Appon the laste Yole-day -
Twelve monethes es gone -
Were he knyghte, were he king,
He come one his playnge.
With me he chaungede a ring,
The richeste of one.
The body myght I noghte see
That made that chaungyng with me,
Bot what that ever he be,
The better hase he tone!"

Scho says, "The better hase he tane;
Siche a vertue es in the stane,
In alle this werlde wote I nane
Siche stone in a rynge;
A man that had it in were
One his body for to bere,
There scholde no dyntys hym dere,
Ne to the dethe brynge."
And then wiste Sir Percevale
Full wele by the ladys tale
That he had broghte hir in bale
Thurgh his chaungyng.
Than also sone sayd he
To that lady so fre,
"I sall the louse fro the tre,
Als I ame trewe kyng."

He was bothe kyng and knyght:
Wele he helde that he highte;
He loused the lady so brighte,
Stod bown to the tre.
Down satt the lady,
And yong Percevall hir by.
Forwaked was he wery:
Rist hym wolde he.
He wende wele for to ryst,
Bot it wolde nothyng laste.
Als he lay althir best,
His hede one hir kne,
Scho putt on Percevell wighte,
Bad hym fle with all his myghte,
"For yonder comes the Blake Knyghte;
Dede mon ye be!"

Scho sayd, "Dede mon ye be,
I say yow, sir certanly:
Yonder out comes he
That will us bothe slee!"
The knyghte gan hir answere,
"Tolde ye me noghte lang ere
Ther solde no dynttis me dere,
Ne wirke me no woo?"
The helme on his hede he sett;
Bot or he myght to his stede get,
The Blak Knyght with hym mett,
His maistrys to mo.
He sayd, "How! hase thou here
Fonden now thi play-fere?
Ye schall haby it full dere
Er that I hethen go!"

He said, "Or I hethyn go,
I sall sle yow bothe two,
And all siche othir mo,
Thaire waryson to yelde."
Than sayd Percevell the fre,
"Now sone than sall we see
Who that es worthy to bee
Slayne in the felde."
No more speke thay that tyde,
Bot sone togedir gan thay ryde,
Als men that wolde were habyde,
With schafte and with schelde.
Than Sir Percevell the wight
Bare down the Blake Knyght.
Than was the lady so bright
His best socour in telde;

Scho was the beste of his belde:
Bot scho had there bene his schelde,
He had bene slayne in the felde,
Right certeyne in hy.
Ever als Percevell the kene
Sold the knyghtis bane hafe bene,
Ay went the lady bytwene
And cryed, "Mercy!"
Than the lady he forbere,
And made the Blak Knyghte to swere
Of alle evylls that there were,
Forgiffe the lady.
And Percevell made the same othe
That he come never undir clothe
To do that lady no lothe
That pendid to velany.

"I did hir never no velany;
Bot slepande I saw hir ly:
Than kist I that lady -
I will it never layne.
I tok a ryng that I fande;
I left hir, I undirstande,
That sall I wele warande,
Anothir ther-agayne."
Thofe it were for none other thyng,
He swere by Jhesu, Heven-kyng,
To wete withowtten lesyng,
And here to be slayne;
"And all redy is the ryng;
And thou will myn agayne bryng,
Here will I make the chaungyng,
And of myn awnn be fayne."

He saise, "Of myn I will be fayne."
The Blak Knyghte ansuers agayne:
Sayd, "For sothe, it is noghte to layne,
Thou come over-late.
Als sone als I the ryng fande,
I toke it sone off hir hande;
To the lorde of this lande
I bare it one a gate.
That gate with grefe hafe I gone:
I bare it to a gude mone,
The stalwortheste geant of one
That any man wate.
Es it nowther knyghte ne kyng
That dorste aske hym that ryng,
That he ne wolde hym down dyng
With harmes full hate."

"Be thay hate, be thay colde,"
Than said Percevell the bolde,
For the tale that he tolde
He wex all tene.
He said, "Heghe on galous mote he hyng
That to the here giffes any ryng,
Bot thou myn agayne brynge,
Thou haste awaye geven!
And yif it may no nother be,
Righte sone than tell thou me
The sothe: whilke that es he
Thou knawes, that es so kene?
Ther es no more for to say,
Bot late me wynn it yif I may,
For thou hase giffen thi part of bothe away,
Thof thay had better bene."

He says, "Thofe thay had better bene."
The knyghte ansuerde in tene,
"Thou sall wele wete, withowtten wene,
Wiche that es he!
If thou dare do als thou says,
Sir Percevell de Galays,
In yone heghe palays,
Therin solde he be,
The riche ryng with that grym!
The stane es bright and nothyng dym;
For sothe, ther sall thou fynd hym:
I toke it fro me;
Owthir within or withowt,
Or one his play ther abowte,
Of the he giffes littill dowte,
And that sall thou see."

He says, "That sall thou see,
I say the full sekirly."
And than forthe rydis he
Wondirly swythe.
The geant stode in his holde,
That had those londis in wolde:
Saw Percevell, that was bolde,
One his lande dryfe;
He calde one his portere:
"How-gate may this fare?
I se a bolde man yare
On my lande ryfe.
Go reche me my playlome,
And I sall go to hym sone;
Hym were better hafe bene at Rome,
So ever mote I thryfe!"

Whethir he thryfe or he the,
Ane iryn clobe takes he;
Agayne Percevell the fre
He went than full right.
The clobe wheyhed reghte wele
That a freke myght it fele:
The hede was of harde stele,
Twelve stone weghte!
Ther was iryn in the wande,
Ten stone of the lande,
And one was byhynde his hande,
For holdyng was dight.
Ther was thre and twenty in hale;
Full evyll myght any men smale,
That men telles nowe in tale,
With siche a lome fighte.

Now are thay bothe bown,
Mett one a more brown,
A mile withowt any town,
Boldly with schelde.
Than saide the geant so wight,
Als sone als he sawe the knyght,
"Mahown, loved be thi myght!"
And Percevell byhelde.
"Art thou hym, that," saide he than,
"That slew Gollerothirame?
I had no brothir bot hym ane,
When he was of elde."
Than said Percevell the fre,
"Thurgh grace of God so sall I the,
And siche geantes as ye
Sle thaym in the felde!"

Siche metyng was seldom sene.
The dales dynned thaym bytwene
For dynttis that thay gaffe bydene
When thay so mett.
The gyant with his clobe-lome
Wolde hafe strekyn Percevell sone,
Bot he therunder wightely come,
A stroke hym to sett.
The geant missede of his dynt;
The clobe was harde as the flynt:
Or he myght his staffe stynt
Or his strengh lett,
The clobe in the erthe stode:
To the midschafte it wode.
The Percevell the gode,
Hys swerde owt he get.

By then hys swerde owt he get,
Strykes the geant withowtten lett,
Merkes even to his nekk,
Reght even ther he stode;
His honde he strykes hym fro,
His lefte fote also,
With siche dyntis as tho.
Nerre hym he yode.
Then sayd Percevell, "I undirstande
Thou myghte with a lesse wande
Hafe weledid better thi hande
And hafe done the some gode;
Now bese it never for ane
The clobe of the erthe tane.
I tell thi gatis alle gane,
Bi the gude Rode!"

He says, "By the gud Rode,
As evyll als thou ever yode,
Of thi fote thou getis no gode;
Bot lepe if thou may!"
The geant gan the clobe lefe,
And to Percevell a dynt he yefe
In the nekk with his nefe.
So ne neghede thay.
At that dynt was he tene:
He strikes off the hande als clene
Als ther hadde never none bene.
That other was awaye.
Sythen his hede gan he off hafe;
He was ane unhende knave
A geantberde so to schafe,
For sothe, als I say!

Now for sothe, als I say,
He lete hym ly there he lay,
And rydis forthe one his way
To the heghe holde.
The portare saw his lorde slayne;
The kayes durste he noght layne.
He come Percevell agayne;
The gatis he hym yolde.
At the firste bygynnyng,
He askede the portere of the ryng -
If he wiste of it any thyng -
And he hym than tolde:
He taughte hym sone to the kiste
Ther he alle the golde wiste,
Bade hym take what hym liste
Of that he hafe wolde.

Percevell sayde, hafe it he wolde,
And schott owtt all the golde
Righte there appon the faire molde;
The ryng owte glade.
The portare stode besyde,
Sawe the ryng owt glyde,
Sayde ofte, "Wo worthe the tyde
That ever was it made!"
Percevell answerde in hy,
And asked wherefore and why
He banned it so brothely,
Bot if he cause hade.
Then alsone said he,
And sware by his lewté:
"The cause sall I tell the,
Withowten any bade."

He says, "Withowtten any bade,
The knyghte that it here hade,
Theroff a presande he made,
And hedir he it broghte.
Mi mayster tuke it in his hande,
Ressayved faire that presande:
He was chefe lorde of this lande,
Als man that mekill moghte.
That tyme was here fast by
Wonnande a lady,
And hir wele and lely
He luffede, als me thoghte.
So it byfelle appon a day,
Now the sothe als I sall say,
Mi lorde went hym to play,
And the lady bysoghte.

Now the lady byseches he
That scho wolde his leman be;
Fast he frayned that free,
For any kyns aughte.
At the firste bygynnyng,
He wolde hafe gyffen hir the ryng;
And when scho sawe the tokynyng,
Then was scho un-saughte.
Scho gret and cried in hir mone;
Sayd, 'Thefe, hase thou my sone slone
And the ryng fro hym tone,
That I hym bitaughte?'
Hir clothes ther scho rafe hir fro,
And to the wodd gan scho go;
Thus es the lady so wo,
And this is the draghte.

For siche draghtis als this,
Now es the lady wode, iwys,
And wilde in the wodde scho es,
Ay sythen that ilke tyde.
Fayne wolde I take that free,
Bot alsone als scho sees me,
Faste awaye dose scho flee:
Will scho noghte abyde."
Then sayde Sir Percevell,
"I will assaye full snelle
To make that lady to duelle;
Bot I will noghte ryde:
One my fete will I ga,
That faire lady to ta.
Me aughte to bryng hir of wa:
I laye in hir syde."

He sayse, "I laye in hir syde;
I sall never one horse ryde
Till I hafe sene hir in tyde,
Spede if I may;
Ne none armoure that may be
Sall come appone me
Till I my modir may see,
Be nyghte or by day.
Bot reghte in the same wode
That I firste fro hir yode,
That sall be in my mode
Aftir myn other play;
Ne I ne sall never mare
Come owt of yone holtis hare
Till I wete how scho fare,
For sothe, als I saye."

Now for sothe, als I say,
With that he helde one his way,
And one the morne, when it was day,
Forthe gonn he fare.
His armour he leved therin,
Toke one hym a gayt-skynne,
And to the wodde gan he wyn,
Among the holtis hare.
A sevenyght long hase he soghte;
His modir ne fyndis he noghte.
Of mete ne drynke he ne roghte,
So full he was of care.
Till the nynte day, byfell
That he come to a welle
Ther he was wonte for to duelle
And drynk take hym thare.

When he had dronken that tyde,
Forthirmare gan he glyde;
Than was he warre, hym besyde,
Of the lady so fre;
Bot when scho sawe hym thare,
Scho bygan for to dare,
And sone gaffe hym answare,
That brighte was of ble.
Scho bigan to call and cry:
Sayd, "Siche a sone hade I!"
His hert lightened in hy,
Blythe for to bee.
Be that he come hir nere
That scho myght hym here,
He said, "My modir full dere,
Wele byde ye me!"

Be that, so nere getis he
That scho myghte nangatis fle,
I say yow full certeynly.
Hir byhoved ther to byde.
Scho stertis appon hym in tene;
Wete ye wele, withowtten wene,
Had hir myghte so mekill bene,
Scho had hym slayne that tyde!
Bot his myghte was the mare,
And up he toke his modir thare;
One his bake he hir bare:
Pure was his pryde.
To the castell, withowtten mare,
The righte way gon he fare;
The portare was redy yare,
And lete hym in glyde.

In with his modir he glade,
Als he sayse that it made;
With siche clothes als thay hade,
Thay happed hir forthy.
The geant had a drynk wroghte,
The portere sone it forthe broghte,
For no man was his thoghte
Bot for that lady.
Thay wolde not lett long thon,
Bot lavede in hir with a spone.
Then scho one slepe fell also sone,
Reght certeyne in hy.
Thus the lady there lyes
Thre nyghttis and thre dayes,
And the portere alwayes
Lay wakande hir by.

Thus the portare woke hir by -
Ther whills hir luffed sekerly, -
Till at the laste the lady
Wakede, als I wene.
Then scho was in hir awenn state
And als wele in hir gate
Als scho hadde nowthir arely ne late
Never therowte bene.
Thay sett tham down one thaire kne,
Thanked Godde, alle three,
That he wolde so appon tham see
As it was there sene.
Sythen aftir gan thay ta
A riche bathe for to ma,
And made the lady in to ga,
In graye and in grene.

Than Sir Percevell in hy
Toke his modir hym by,
I say yow than certenly,
And home went hee.
Grete lordes and the Qwene
Welcomed hym al bydene;
When thay hym on lyfe sene;
Than blythe myghte thay bee.
Sythen he went into the Holy Londe,
Wanne many cités full stronge,
And there was he slayne, I undirstonde;
Thusgatis endis hee.
Now Jhesu Criste, hevens Kyng,
Als He es Lorde of all thyng,
Grante us all His blyssyng!
Amen, for charyté!
