Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate
Celebrate life

[Verse 1  ]
This Vibe is 10 over 10
Again and again
See am just playing Coz life is a game
Play it well and you gonna be a champion
Like the Mweru beach, watching on the sunset
With loud music booming in my headset
If you haven't you should check out Chienge
I trapped and rapped on reggae
(I’m bringing back biggie)
(And then am bringing back marley)
I dropped mad bombs it will be like Baghdad
Could you bring that money
So'hat we can start dat party
U guyz should start clapping
Before I even get started

Go crazy
Celebrate life if you can
Am I making sense? My brother
Am I making sense?

[ Verse 2 ]
Ukunchinga mu game imyebe nalikene
Nga muli tupuba talikeni
Kale mwampata mpateni napapene
Chikulu ine life ilikenge
Ba gelo natemwa ni balya aba fitenge
But I won't judge ngawa temwa ama legging
Just as long as you are not faking
I’m not even serious am just thinking out loud
Lights out, black out
Feel the riddim move down your body
One time, now show that other side
The wild side, the crazy side
You folks is trying to free your lives
But first you got to free your minds
Iyi ninshita yakushimya ama Ramia
Lets show them something zambian

[ verse 3]

Celebrate life if you can
But if you can't the just grinding
Just keep hustling
My brother just keep fighting
One day we gonna flex together
One day we gonna drink together
One day we gonna bounce together
One day we gonna ride together (hah)
In the high way lusaka Kabwe
Do it in our way
Ride out in a brand new Audi
No more hiding
In the stereo this jam vining
Riddim of freedom
RIDDIMPTION
Don't ask me questions, just
