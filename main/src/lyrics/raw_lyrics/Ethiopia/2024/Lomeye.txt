Yeah she like Henny and Crystals a little weed here and there
Her skin shines like a disco
Get tangled up in her hair
Yeah she like Henny and Crystals (she like Henny and Crystals)
A little weed here and there (ain’t nothing wrong with a lil smoke)
Here skin shines like the disco (skin shine like the stars tonight)
Get tangled up in her hair (I can see me with this girl for life)

[Verse 1]
What’s yo name
What’s yo sign
What’s yo moon, yo sun, yo risе
What’s yo lies, what’s yo truth
What’s that tattoo on your thigh, what yo
What’s yo occupation you get off at 9
How bout I
Scoop you up bout 10
Peek inside yo mind, how bout
How bout you tеll me nothing
Let me tell you bout you
Right now you acting shy but I’ll get it up outchea
But in a good way
You know why I meant
Yo headphones in
But I can tell it ain’t no music playing in it
But if it was you’d probably be listening to Lauryn Hill
Or sumn real but still play Future when you wearing heels
A good mix a good balance
I'm guessing you a Libra
I’m Domani, I’m a Pisces pleasure to meet you
Before we split how bout we exchange digits
I know you doing things busy
And prolly won’t hang with me tonight
Well I don’t mind if we just talk for awhile
Here go my number to to dial whatever to make you smile
You might also like[Chorus]
And she like Henny and Crystals a little weed here and there
Her skin shines like a disco
Get tangled up in her hair
Yeah she like Henny and Crystals (she like Henny and Crystals)
A little weed here and there (ain’t nothing wrong with a lil smoke)
Here skin shines like the disco (skin shine like the stars tonight)
Get tangled up in her hair (I can see me with this girl for life)

[Verse 2]
How you doin miss lady
Glad you hit me up
See you a real deal playa the way you stood me up
I’m just playing I know you was busy
I like an independent woman
So it’s good you don’t need me but look
I heard you into crystals so which one is this
Look I’ll trade you my Rose Quart for your Amethyst
I was thinking of turning it to a bracelet
I’m loving this conversation
Let’s see how far we can take it
I gotta few thangs that’s on my mind
Not attracted by just your vibe
But your body too I want more
I gotta glimpse and it got me tipsy
I’m stumbling but still sipping
I think I’m falling in love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, loveee
[Chorus]
Yeah she like Henny and Crystals a little weed here and there
Her skin shines like a disco
Get tangled up in her hair
Yeah she like Henny and Crystals (she like Henny and Crystals)
A little weed here and there (ain’t nothing wrong with a lil smoke)
Here skin shines like the disco (skin shine like the stars tonight)
Get tangled up in her hair (I can see me with this girl for life)
