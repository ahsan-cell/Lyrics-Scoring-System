[Chorus]
Money is the root to all evil
Lego life, I was stackin' C-notes (Stack it up)
I was up late at work for my cizzoach
Had to be there like takin' care all my kinfolks (I'll make sure they all straight)
Yeah, it's been like that since day one (Ever since day one)
I'ma keep some huns, I'ma keep a gun (I'ma keep a gun)
Had it been like that, we'll never bond (Had it been like that)
I was tryna tell you I'm closin' one (I'm tryna tell you)

[Verse]
I came out the dirt (Came out the dirt)
I ain't never seen a church (Never seen a church)
I ain't have the patience to serve work (So what?)
I'd rather get a mask and go lay and lurk (Brrt, hey)
I used to get drove home by the counselors (Skrrt, skrrt)
I used to get drove wrong by the dancers (I fell in love)
I used to be strapped heavy, yeah, ammo (Pew, pew, pew, pew)
I'm stuffin' this bitch with the wood, yeah, panels (Ah, panels)
I just might cop a new foreign and go wham in it (I just might cop a new foreign, go wham in it)
I turned my whole hood into bloods, yeah, bandages
I wake up and count up some bands, I let my bitch drive with it (Count up some bands, racks)
I'm boolin', I'm sittin' on my high horse, saddle, yeah (High horse)
And I pray that it remain that way (Remain that way)
My bitch done fell in love with my ways (Fell in love with my ways)
I'm the boss, I do what all y'all say (I do what all y'all say)
Play with us and you might die today (Voom, voom, hey)
Toys-R-Us, we got them tools on deck (Toys-R-Us, them tools on us)
Thirty rounds, we got them rulers on deck (Voom, voom, voom, voom, voom, brrt)
Fuck the judge, we don't live by rules, no way, ayy, ayy, ayy (Motherfuck the judge)
Where yo' head at (What?), where yo' neck at (Head)
Big bands got my pants stretchin' right to left (Left)
Ain't have no hands out, I did it myself (Self)
I'ma go Tasmanian, yeah, ayy
Show the bitch how to play, now she wanna stay (Ha)
And I'll cash out on her any day (Ha)
Yeah, I'll cash out, yeah
I got a pool in the middle of the house, ayy (Ayy)
She saw it, then she passed out (Jeffery)
