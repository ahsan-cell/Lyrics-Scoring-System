Yeah it’s hella

{Hook}

Off a straight shot of whiskey
Far from slizard barely tipsy
Whole life moving like a gypsy
Making tracks and keep its grizzly
It’s the Town it’ ain’t Poughkeepsie
Yeah they’re real so they fuck with me
Amazing ride but this ain’t Disney
Sport coupe so they can’t get me
Blue face and Digi Benjis
Oh yeah Digi Benjis
Blue face and Digi Benjis
Oh yeah Digi Benjis
Blue face and Digi Benjis
Oh yeah Digi Benjis
Blue face and Digi Benjis
Oh yeah Digi Benjis

{Verse 1}

Off a straight shot of whiskey
Far from slizard barely tipsy
Whole life moving like a gypsy
Making tracks and keep its grizzly
This the Town it’ ain’t Poughkeepsie
Yeah they’re real so they fuck with me
Amazing ride but this ain’t Disney
Sport coupe so they can’t get me
Blue face and Digi Benjis
Everyday I tote the semi
Hit the weights and wash my jimmy
Ain’t a cynic
Off the Riddick Bowe
One hit will have em spinning whoa
We ain’t the average city folk
We going hard they going broke
Parades you see me on the float
Far from average more the G.O.A.T
Freestyle tracks just like a wrote
Niggas like that’s Murder She Wrote
Nigga naw. He just flows
He just flowes with a cold ass flow
With the cold ass flow make em comatose
Comatose nigga spit that flow
With the real ass flow
Where the niggas go…

Whole life moving like a gypsy
Off a straight shot of that whiskey
Far from slizard I’m barely tipsy
Eating good no fucking Wendy’s
China style they’ll take your kidneys
If you talk about the city
Roll up on you like it Timmy (South Park)
Cats is broke waiting for stimmies (stimulus)
Of the Markers mark and remi
Round here it’s Tito’s or the Henny
Hit your liver and your kidney
Extra shots in the extendy
Old school hoping out the mini
Van and man they pack them semis
Pockets skinny. You look like Wendy’s
Making 20’s off of pennies
Don’t have time for cats pretending
Spit flame burn you out the building
Don’t know why they’re in their feelings
