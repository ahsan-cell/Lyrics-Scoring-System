Me and my girlies
We gon' party 'til it's early
Got me feelin' otherworldly tonight
Caught in some traffic
But the radio is blastin'
Drop a red light and we'll sing it goodbye

[Pre-Chorus: Sakura]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
By the mornin', feel like magic

[Chorus: Kim Chaewon, Kazuha]
I got all I need
You know nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancin' with my girls
Perfect energy
Yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free
There's no better feelin' in the whole wide world

[Post-Chorus: Huh Yunjin, Hong Eunchae]
Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowin' up my line
I'd care at 11:59
But nothing counts after midnight

Come and take a ride with me
I got a crеdit card and some good company
Some come through, makе the fit real good
Why you still stuck on loading? Waitin' on you, babe

[Pre-Chorus: Kim Chaewon]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Night to mornin', live slow motion

[Chorus: Sakura, Huh Yunjin]
I got all I need
You know nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancin' with my girls
Perfect energy
Yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free
There's no better feelin' in the whole wide world

[Post-Chorus: Hong Eunchae, Huh Yunjin]
Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowin' up my line
I'd care at 11:59
But nothin' counts after midnight

[Interlude: Sakura]
Oh
Oh, oh (Ha-ha-ha)
[Pre-Chorus: Kazuha]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
By the mornin', feel like magic

[Chorus: Hong Eunchae, Kim Chaewon, Huh Yunjin]
I got all I need
You know nothing else can beat
The way that I feel when I'm dancin' with my girls (Yeah)
Perfect energy (Uh-huh)
Yeah, we flawless, yeah, we free
There's no better feelin' in the whole wide world

[Post-Chorus: Huh Yunjin, Kim Chaewon]
Tonight
I don't care what's wrong or right
Don't start blowin' up my line
I'd care at 11:59
Don't start blowin' up my line
