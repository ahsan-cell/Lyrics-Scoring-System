[Intro: Ruka]
Alright, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Alright, okay
BABYMONSTER

[Verse 1: Asa, Chiquita, Rora, Ahyeon & (Ruka)]
I got no worries on my mind
난 멈추지 않아 so you can say goodbye (Bye, bye, bye)
I'll fulfill my fantasy and you can watch and see
박수나 쳐보지
눈부셔
They say, "She looking flawless," I know (타고났지 like this)
She's unlike, unlike anybody
여기저기 다 난리 난리
가나다라마바 싸가지
Gotta, gotta go, so c'est la vie

[Pre-Chorus: Chiquita & Pharita]
I'm dancin' in the moonlight
Ooh, ooh, ayy
Can't stop this feelin' tonight
What you waiting for?

Baby, it was all a dream
You thought I was yours, 멋대로 착각하지는 마
It's bitter, it's sweet
저 하늘 높이, I'm spreading my wings like I'ma live

[Post-Chorus: Chiquita, Pharita, Rora, Rami & (Ruka)]
Forever (Like I'ma live forever)
Forever (Like I'ma, like I'ma)
Forever
Like I'm gonna live, like I'm gonna live forever

[Interlude: Asa]
Okay, you know what it is

[Verse 2: Ruka, Asa & All]
I'm that nice, 뭘 것 같아 너와 내 차이
Pull up on me, pay the price
Put a milli on a rock my type
Never seen it in your life (Cha-ching)
예뻐 그러니까 바빠 아니 나빠 온 세상 울리는 bad girl
B-A-B-Y-M-O-N (Get money)
'Bout it, 'bout it 발끝까지 까지
리듬 타지 타지 기분 짜릿짜릿, everybody get down
Roll up on 'em with the motor runnin', I'ma give you something
Bet you put the money in the bag
[Pre-Chorus: Rora & Ahyeon]
I'm dancin' in the moonlight
Ooh, ooh, ayy
Can't stop this feelin' tonight
What you waiting for?

[Chorus: Chiquita & Pharita]
Baby, it was all a dream
You thought I was yours, 멋대로 착각하지는 마
It's bitter, it's sweet
저 하늘 높이, I'm spreading my wings like I'ma live

[Post-Chorus: Ruka, Rora, Ahyeon, Pharita & (Asa)]
Forever (Like I'ma live forever)
Forever (Like I'ma, like I'ma)
Forever
Like I'm gonna live, like I'm gonna live forever

[Bridge: Rora, Pharita, Asa & Ahyeon]
I can see the bright horizon
세상이란 벽을 넘어서
No, nothing can stop me now
We forever, forever
Forever, ever, ever (Ooh)

[Chorus: Rami, Rami & Ahyeon, Ahyeon]
Baby, it was all a dream
You thought I was yours, 멋대로 착각하지는 마
It's bitter, it's sweet (Oh-woah)
저 하늘 높이, I'm spreading my wings, like I'ma live
[Post-Chorus: All, Pharita, Ruka & Asa]
Forever (Forever, ever, ever)
Forever (We forever, forever, forever, ever, ever)
Forever
Like I'm gonna live, like I'm gonna live forever3
