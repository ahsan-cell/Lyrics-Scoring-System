I see that look upon your face
Something my mind cannot erase
If we keep staring then I might have to
Might have to start to walk your way
I wanna hear what you would say
You got high standards and I do too (Too)

[Pre-Chorus: Ahyeon, All]
'Cause all those girls (They don't)
Know what you need (They don't)
But I know, I know the way, the way
To make, to make sure you never leave (Yeah)

[Chorus: Rami, Pharita]
If I come close, baby, would you like that?
If I give some, would you give it right back?
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that? Baby, would you like that?
Say you want love, boy, I know what that means
Make you feel way better than in your dreams
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that? Baby, would you likе that?

[Verse 2: Ruka]
Yo, it's like that, like that (Like that)
How you run it right back
Know you on thе right track
Queen, ace (Blackjack)
I be thinking way too much
I need to let it go
You be running through my mind
And I'ma let it show

'Cause ain't nobody stepping up to me
And saying nothing when I calling you
Be running eye to eye we never fronting, yeah
We zoning (Uh), bet we stunting (Uh)
On and on (Uh) and on and on and
To the top, baby boy, we be rolling

[Pre-Chorus: Chiquita, Rami]
'Cause all those girls (They don't)

But I know, I know the way, the way
To make, to make sure you never leave (Let's get it, yeah)

[Chorus: Rora, Ahyeon, Rami, Rami & Ahyeon]
If I come close, baby, would you like that? (Like that)
If I give some, would you give it right back? (Right back)
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that? Baby, would you like that?
Say you want love, boy, I know what that means
Make you feel way better than in your dreams
If I show you that I know where it's at
Baby, would you like that? Baby, would you like that?
