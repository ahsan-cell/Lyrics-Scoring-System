You know I got ya
You know that I got you like that
Ain't nobody gonna have your back like the way I do
You love it, just say you do
You know you got me
Everything you do, everything you did
Everything I wish I was with, makes me feel alright
I'm just saying, so

[Pre-Chorus]
I really like it
Nothin' in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do
I really like it
Nothin' in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do

[Chorus]
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Look at you, now look at me
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
Look at you, now look at mе
How you ever, evеr gonna find someone like this?

[Verse 2]
You're the reason my heart skips, drops
Just a little touch, my world stops
Finally, I know that you're mine
I don't wanna fall
Don't wanna play this game of love, oh-eh-oh
There's nowhere to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
I really like it
Nothing in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do
I really like it
Nothing in the world can make me feel the way you do, the things you do

[Chorus]
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
I love you and me
Dancing in the moonlight
Nobody can see
It's just you and me tonight
[Post-Chorus]
Look at you, now look at me
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?
Look at you, now look at me
How you ever, ever gonna find someone like this?

[Interlude]
(Ever, ever gonna find someone like this)
(Someone like this)

[Bridge]
I don't care 'bout your first love
This should be your last one
Nothin' like your last one
You look better on me, that's fashion
Won't block your shots, lights, camera, action
Never been a love me or a love me not thing
Every petal better tell him, better not change
I love you, I love me a lot, wait
Which one I love better? Better off not saying

[Outro]
I love you and me6
