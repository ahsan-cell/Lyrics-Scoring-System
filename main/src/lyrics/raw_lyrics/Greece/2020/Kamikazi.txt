Yeah, yeah
Big Mike, here we go
Listen
Listen

[Verse One: Big Mike]
Listen
I mean business, I ain’t talking about the front office
Look at all my dubs, I ain’t got losses
Take your favorite rapper, throw him in a coffin
So when you walk around me, walk cautious
Like eggshells
Our lines don’t cross, parallel
I’m like Heaven, fuck with me, I give you Hell
Retired, they still hit me for a verse
A double edged sword, the gift and the curse
The gift is my vocals
The curse is getting burnt on the mic, and I ain’t talking bout Chernobyl
When you this hot, you got the right to be cocky
Italian Stallion, call me Rocky
I rock the beat, shoutout to Rick
My rhymes is like oil, they just that slick
Pick a beat, I pull up looking mean
Fuck 8 Bars man, lets go for 16
Yeah, I said let’s go for 16
Feeling like OutKast, I’m so fresh, so clean
Fantasize about performing at the Garden
MVP candidate like James Harden
Fear the beard when I’m cooking up in the booth
Your girl wanna taste of me, she got a sweet tooth
From nothin’ to somethin’ like I’m Fabolous
I’m top tier bitch, miraculous
My money tall, even right beside Ewing
Imma get that dough, it don’t matter what I’m doing
I got the swagger, roll up feeling confident
Present myself well, while y’all do the opposite
I call it how I see it, talk it how I be it
I’m the realest one out here, I guarantee it
16 bars, should I go for 24?
Fuck it, let’s give em 8 more
Great power, great responsibility
An MC better than me? No possibility
You think I ain’t hot? You so wrong
List of hits goes on and on and on
I could make a whole album bout catching bodies
Like Eminem did with Kamikaze
What more do I have to prove?
Call me Young MC, the way I bust a move
Pull up in my ride feeling pimp like
Xzibit, in 04, 05
Breath, Stretch, Shake
Shoutout to Murda Mase
We both left the game
And I’ll be back to stay one day
A Hype, are you ready to go?
Are you ready to show them how New Berlin flow?

Yo
Of course I am
We go together like peanut butter and jam
God damn
I get your fingers sticky, and then I slam
My whole life, I've been hated against
They try to offend my style but since
I'm too dope I've got them tense
But fuck it
?
Me and Big Mike, y'all ?
?
Greedy motherfucker ate off my plate and stole my dinner
Shoutout to the trio, terrifying to the rest like the reign of Stalin
Ice Trae, Kevin Huerter and John Collins
DeAndre Hunter, join the club
We take the dub
82 times, 16 more
Finals trophy, final score
And like Rakim, disagree with ?
?
Picture of it, paint it like the Mona
I ain't icy in the ?, pass me a Corona
So I can give it back to a poor neighborhood
You're good if you agree ?
These kids deserve a lot
Like having b-ball game to 21, they savage for what they got
And J dot, bring Cole to the kids
And they'll never get it
?
Yeah
Can't fuck around with these OG's
Of the rap game
Bring you to your fucking knees
