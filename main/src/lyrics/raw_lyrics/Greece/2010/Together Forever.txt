Together forever in death

(Verse 1: Komatose)
Why did you hate me when we were little kids?
You never bothered to tell me all the things that I did
You just called me names, we never played games
I sat by myself, recess always seemed to be the same
So now I seek the things that make you repulsed
I wanna watch your naked body shake and convulse
I pulled your curly hair just to get you to notice
Now I stalk you in the shadows with animal-like focus
You never should have taunted me 'cuz now it means your life
I wanna cut and take your skin, fleshe to carve in with a knife
I loved you all through school, you never gave me a chance
I even wrote you love letters and asked you to the dance
You told me yes, but secretly you were schemin'
Your boyfriend was ready, ready to dish out a beatin'
But that faithful knife was ready to send you to Heaven
Like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Seven shanks to his throat as I cried about you girl
You never wanted my company, im not welcome in your world
With the cops on scene, I strolled to your home
Waited for a few hours, now I got you all alone
I peep into your bedroom from the lawn outside
I can see the tears on your face, your pain is hard to hide
You're holding a picture, who could it be?
To my amazement and shock, a picture of me
Could it be that you love me, could it even be true?
My pulse begins to rise as I knock like one, two
*Knocks*
The look on your face is worth a thousand words
The fire in your eyes is how my broken heart burns
I let myself in and walked into your arms
Don't worry babydoll I mean you no harm
I left the words that i'm sayin' on a piece of paper
I hope this note explains this little caper
I slit your frail throat then hold your body tight
I loved you forever, now walk into the light
I left this behind to show you meant the most
Together forever in death, signed Komatose
