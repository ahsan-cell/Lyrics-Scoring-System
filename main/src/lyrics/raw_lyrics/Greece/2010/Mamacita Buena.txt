You wanna feel it everyday
But now you're treating me wrong
You know I gave my heart away

But baby I still feel the fire
You and me can pull the wires
You said you needed love
I say that you just wanna play

But I, I'm always thinkin' of you
I, Baby I'm givin' you my life
If you believe in me I'll try
And give it to you right

Mamacita mamacita buena
Mamacita mamacita buena
Mamacita mamacita buena
Que dios te ampare, Que dios te ampare

You said you needed time
I'm always doin' as you say
And when it comes to our love
You say you have to stay away

But baby I still feel the fire
You and me can pull the wires
You said you needed love
I say that you just wanna play
You might also likeBut I, I'm always thinkin' of you
I, Baby I'm givin' you my life
If you believe in me I'll try
And give it to you right

Que dios te ampare, Que dios te ampare
