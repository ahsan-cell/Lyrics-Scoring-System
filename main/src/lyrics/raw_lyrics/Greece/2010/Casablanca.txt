She had a beautiful smile
And an incredible style
No matter how long it has been
I can't get her out of my mind, no
So tell me what do you say
Giving myself the blues
I might as well admit to it
I need her back, in my life

[Chorus]
I think I left the love of my life behind
In Casablanca ha
I've got to buy myself a ticket tonight
Got to go there, where?
Casablanca ha
Casa, hey
You're holding my love
Casa, hey
You're holding my love
You've got to let her go now

[Verse 2]
I've got to let her know
I've come to let my feelings show
You've been away too long, baby
It's time to come on home, yeah
Even if it's the last fight, huh
I've got to leave tonight
I've got no other choice
I need to hear your voice once again
You might also like[Chorus]
I think I left the love of my life behind
In Casablanca ha
I've got to buy myself a ticket tonight
Got to go there, where?
Casablanca ha
Casa, hey
You're holding my love
Casa, hey
You're holding my love
You've got to let her go now

[Bridge]
Hey, she's the love of my life
Oh, she's the love of my life, my life
I need her back
She's the love of my life
I need her back, I need her back
I need her back in my life
Oh, Casa
You've got to let her go now

[Outro]
Casa, Casa
Casa, Casa
