Rising on the horizon
I feel it coming
It's coming home
My soul it’s on it
Without it there is no life
My soul it's on it
Nowhere to go

You and me on the planet till the weekend
Get up, let's go
Let it be us together till the world ends
Nowhere to go

Fly me to the brightest star in the sky
I love the sun
And you know why

Where are you going?
What do you mean it’s time?
Where are you going?
Don't leave me, no
I'm kinda lonely
I need you by my side
My soul it's calling
Nowherе to go

Get up, let's go
Let it be us together till the world ends
Nowhere to go

Fly me to the brightest star in the sky

And you know why
