I'll always remember
Our summer in Hawaii
Aloha

[Verse 1: Mohombi]
Under the coconut tree we stay
Fall and crush into me like a wave
You bring the fool out my groove
Baby, use your tubes
Make me wanna change my ways
Under the coconut tree you be chilling with me
Making love to you in a bedford room made of sand and sea
No place I'd rather be, no one else I wanna please
No one but you, boo, I got you, you got the best of me

[Chorus: Mohombi]
Hey, usually I'll be gone before the morning lights
Oh, but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger & Mohombi]
Under the coconut tree we stay
Watch as the night turns into day
We let the fire be the light, sky is the floor tonight
Fly me with your gentlest way
Under the coconut tree you be chilling with me
Making love to you in a bedford room made of sand and sea
No place I'd rather be, no one else I wanna please
No one but you boo I got you, you got the best of me

Hey, usually I'll be gone before the morning lights
Oh, but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever

[Bridge: Mohombi & Nicole Scherzinger]
Sing it to me, baby, that melody
When I hear the drums you gon' make me stay
You gon' let it play
Baby, turn it up, up
You sound just like love
You gon' make me stay (make me stay)
You gon' let it play (let it play)
Baby, turn it up, up
You sound just like love, just like love

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger & Mohombi]
Hey, usually I'll be gone before the morning lights
Oh, but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever
Hey, usually I'll be gone before the morning lights
Oh, but your eyes keep telling me it's not the case tonight
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever
You gon' make me stay, gon' make me stay
You gon' make me stay forever
