Naa, I'm fallin' for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin', fallin'
Naa, I'm falling for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin' for your love

[Verse 1]
There were many things I wish I didn't do
I know I've hurt you
Now there are no games left to play
And all this time that I was blind
I didn't see you truly love me
Now you're gone and all I want is a chance
Let me turn back time

[Chorus]
Naa, I'm fallin' for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin', fallin'
Naa, I'm falling for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin' for your love
Your love, your love, your love

Time and time I think about us
I really miss that
Now there's just an empty, empty space
And all this time that I was blind
I didn't see you truly love me
Now you're gone and all I want is a chance
Let me turn back time

[Chorus]
Naa, I'm fallin' for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin', fallin'
Naa, I'm falling for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin' for you
Naa, I'm falling for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
You're the one I'm dreamin' of
I'm fallin' for your love
I'm fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin', fallin'
I'm fallin' for your love
