I will stay, stay awake for you
Let me take you far away
I'll be there, watching over you

I feel like you're my whole life
I feel like you can touch me deep inside
But this time it has to be right
Before you, I've got no one
But baby, there no loneliness tonight
But this time it has to be right

If you wanna hold my hand
I will stay, stay awake for you
Let me take you far away
I'll be there, watching over you

Every time you touch me
And every time you talk to me I fly
So high, I'm touching the sky
I hope that it's the same for you
I'm not alone, I'll die for you
But baby, please, don't blame me now
I hope it's true, I know, I know

If you wanna hold my hand
I will stay, stay awake for you
Let me take you far away
I'll be there, watching over youYou might also like
