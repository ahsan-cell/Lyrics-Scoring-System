See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me

Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Falling in and out of love
In love, In love
Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Falling in and out of love
In love, In love

See the mirror in your eyes
See the truth behind the lies
Your lies are haunting me
See the reason in your eyes
Giving answer to the why
Your eyes are haunting me

[Chorus 1]
Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Falling in and out of love
In love, In love
Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Falling in and out of love
In love, In love, In love
In love, In love, In love
In love, In love, In love
In love, In love, In love

Why can't you see it
Why can't you feel

Don't let it fade away
You keep keep running
I keep keep falling
