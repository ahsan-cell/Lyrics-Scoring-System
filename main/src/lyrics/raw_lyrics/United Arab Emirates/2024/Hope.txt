You’re making a mistake
Here they go, here they go
They all just pipe up and say
Im stuck in childhood dreams
These feelings I can’t shake
And I know and I know I'm riding solo
Who cares, cuz I don’t need no-one

CHORUS-
Dreaming dreaming dreaming oh
Maybe yes maybe no, I don’t know
Everybody just thinks I'm lonely but I'm better on my own

Im not lonely but I can’t sleep at night
In the morning, things just don’t feel right
Im not lonely, feels like I'm losing my mind
Ive been lying to my self
I think I realized I'm so lonely

EZZI-
Here come another day
And I'm all by my self I really dono if I'm right
Trim just out of my mind
Nah I ain't nevеr wrong
One day imma show them how off they was
I knеw it all along

Izzy Drai-
Im not lonely but I can’t sleep at night
In the morning, things just don’t feel right
Im not lonely, feels like I'm losing my mind
Ive been lying to my self
I think I realized I'm so lonely

Yeah maybe I’ve been lying all of this time
Maybe I’ve been goin outta my mind
I don’t wanna lose control of my life
They all talk about me, they say
Im so crazy, I'm like maybe
Try to change me, no I'm lazy
Still got hope, I don’t need saving
Ima be just fine

EZZI & IZZY-
Cuz Im not lonely but I can’t sleep at night
In the morning, things just don’t feel right
Im not lonely, feels like I'm losing my mind
Ive been lying to my self
I think I realized I'm so lonely
