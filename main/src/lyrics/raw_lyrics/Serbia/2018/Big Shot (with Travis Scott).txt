The shit he write down, it be so amazin' when you read it
But have you ever seen a nigga shot so many times it amazin' that he breathin'?
Niggas actin' like it ain't no afterlife but that shit made you a believer
He need a transfusion, but the only one that know his blood type is the pavement where he leakin'
You get desperate, you say, "Take a pint of mine" take it if he needs it
Save him and he bleedin'
Have you ever met Death?
After my first encounter, this Alien would've been beggin' for them to take him to a leader (liter)
You would've been stuck in awe
I'm not even suppose to be here, the ops didn't do they fuckin' job
When I got his call, I immediately removed the serial from every gun I saw
I thought I hit the lottery
They told me I had a Quarter on the card, I just knew I was supposed to scratch somethin' off
I'm fuckin' off
You in H-Town today, this ain't Arizona, this The Spiderverse you Miles away
Get taped and bound today
He gonna feel right at home when I throw him in the trunk
Yeah, cause now The Alien is out of (outer)space
Ride around wit' Ace
You can't phone home and I'ma drive this joint for you
They say The Alien sittin' on bars like E.T. ridin', right?
Well it's lit from this point forward
Do one for me
Who this dude truly is that's in blue before me
Before I was all in the mix I was a star with The Knicks, I went Ewing on 'em
Switchin' loads, doin' laundry, spinnin' more, and stoppin' a Civil War, you can lose an ARMY
Maneuver raw? We were movin' on him
Burnin' money, I will torture rack, and that's why I kept a Luger on me
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
I said, I'm just tryin' to introduce myself to The Alien
And if that don't work, the first contact gon' do it for me
I said I got a few things to call you on; Cornell Powell
Why your stories don't involve your dawgs?
Huh? You might keep a pistol akh, and a Little Rock, but I really ain't sure where you at, like the state of Arkansas
Movin' on to war, it goes on and on
It's on sight, ain't no on and off
Wal-Mart nigga, I got a question
Have you ever had one of your Targets robbed?
That's why I never drive-by you get walked up on
I learned this from John John The Don
I swear to God, before I take this shot, I'ma get closer to Powell (Pau) than Marc Gasol
I'll mark ya all
I said, these ya homies?
Whoever fuck wit' 'em, I'ma make it so his house isn't fun to be
Cause ain't none of you niggas safe when shit is up wit' me
If I'm tryin' to put Rum in a barrel like Captain Morgan's, this nigga bet' not have a lick of (liquor) company
Who told this bitch to fuck wit' me?
Ain't nobody say this yet?
You took punchin' from [?] a punch [?] and a birthday lick and you made it yes
But what I can't respect, is a Crip that don't give us that feel
Which I guess you can't really expect
You do the same exact shit over and over; Fan Duel
You just stick with the safest bet
But you get main events, paid respect, major checks
But to the next phase of battling GOATs and greats, you ain't made it yet
You got one of the biggest fan bases, yet, you Rasheed Wallace, we don't know shit 'bout his bitch ass but blazin' TECs (Blaze' and techs)
I think MRIs and X-rays is next
We don't feel you cause you haven't shown nobody where your pain is yet
You remember Deontay Wilder versus Tyson Fury?
We don't give a fuck how strong the punches are if the audience can't connect
We get paid respect
Until then, it's fuck a punch, these feet we usin'
Fuck a punch, O-Red teeth removin'
I'll lean a cuz, he leakin' fluid
Fuck a punch, 'til his features ruined
Stompin' ya man
Stompin' ya man
This shit look like I'm startin' a band for Sweet Chin Music
It get gruesome every time
When I think about the shit I done did I lose my very mind
I start feelin' like Travis Scott and Kendrick Lamar, Houston
I get the 'Goosebumps' (Every time!)
You punch in battles for oohs and aahs
I punch niggas in real life, you can view the scars
You call yourself "No Let Up", "Cuz Webb", "Baphomet", all that shit is super odd
Yeah, the only name that fits you is "The Alien", cause you leave Earth every battle but don't nobody really know who you are
Now rap you bitch ass nigga
Say somethin' to me
You might also like[Round 1: Rum Nitty]
Off the rip believe he dyin'
A clean sweep, 3-peat
(He got the cheat sheet rhymin'
They said The Alien sittin' on bars like E.T. ridin')
Nigga I will First 48 and A&E ya
Stainless Nina
Shooters will slide in the grayest Kia
Don't got to pay them neither
But if I send $6,843 (6000*843) then I mean goodbye, like a pager beeper
Blaze the heater
Chopper with the tail cut
Burnin' shit, like a Cerberus, it's a Hell pup
12 dump, from a shotgun
See you on the other side, like a mail truck
Better keep your tail tucked
You could've got murked, be happy you (k)not on a shirt like a jail punk
Air somethin', with this tool I tote
Run up on ya whip, catch you and your bitch, shoot y'all both
Let two off close
I might even up the K on your youngin' (Yungeen) Ace, I don't care
'Who I Smoke'
Do you got smoke?

[Ace] No
[Rum]
Just leave it in the streets
All that extra shit you be doin', try that shit wit' me
I'll lift and squeeze
Bulldog to the bully, show him I'm a different breed
Pistol whip his cheek, split his teeth
This can'll (cannon) crack a (cracker) face like Twisted Tea
Make all you niggas bleed
That's how I play
Leave ya body, leave ya body outside laid
Hit the crib for a minute, then I'm back out the cut like a southside fade
Or, I might pull up to the house y'all stay
Known to scheme if you holdin' ki's
.40's squeeze
Headshot if you don't hand over that coke to me
It go through his dome with ease
I'm sayin', as soon as it exit from out ya brain, you gon' release the dope Amin (dopamine)
One mo' will squeeze
Slug blastin', hit the person next to you wit' a shotgun
Pump action
Cuz gaspin'
Ace bandages ain't enough for the blood splashin'
They gonna be fillin' ya patna wounds with cotton balls...stuff Happens
I did see that one battle, you over-snapped
Against Ty Pretty? I'm glad you exposed that man
But you were supposed to smoke his ass
Middle of the stage
Get pretty in the Range (Pretty & Deranged); like Doja Cat
It's over; facts
Closed curtains, pole burstin'
Let six toss, nigga better Sprint off; no service
Cold murder, pistol whip, 'til Amin crack like a Stone burger
The show's over
Aye, when I first heard I hit Ace Amin, I really hit the gym up
I wasn't frontin'
I ain't duckin' nothin'
I hit the treadmill, runnin' runnin'
Inclines, 100 of 'em
I went from eatin' fried pork bellies to stomach crunches
Let me ask this Muslim somethin'
I wonder why, you out here tellin' people you don't gamble, drink alcohol, or eat pork
We all know that stuff a lie (Allah)
You wanna die?
Be careful patna, air a chopper
Three clap, send 'em right through Amin (a mean) hat, like Harry Potter
Prepare for drama
Don't get me amped
You'll get the hands before you get to trippin' fam'
This a rival gang, an away team won't even get the chance
You goin' for Ace? This ya man?
Get split in half
Pull out them B.L.A.D.'s like Jay-Z and Jigga fan
I've been the champ
You can't keep it real yourself- go ahead
[Round 2: Ace Amin]
I said in battle rap? You kill whole families, no regard for fuckin' kids
In real life? You go home to four children and tuck 'em in
In battle rap? You 6'5", all the toughest niggas run from him
In real life? You not even 5'6" my nigga, you the most trusted friend
In battle rap? His homies go in drive-bys, he jumpin' in
In real life? He jump out the car, like Tre from Boyz N The Hood, and that's why I can't let ya punchin' win
Nigga, tuck ya chin
I wasn't on his hitlist, make this the biggest hit then 'Keep Rollin''; Limp Bizkit
His homie KG, but he don't sell big tickets
He wanted Murda, got a murderer, that dig ditches
Sticks lifted
Rifle smoke, then do the Dash with the boat; 'Big Pimpin''
He went from Calicoe to Ace Amin, that's a big difference
One nigga? He be out this bitch skinny dippin'
The other nigga? He'll put a red dot on ya forehead; either way it's six bitches
Bitch listen, I used to have to walk to 1st with free base
I'd rather get caught layin' in somebody's surveillance than layin' behind police tape
I keep a big ass broom for this beef, you don't wanna win this sweepstakes
Cheapskates, I had to pick up magazine, so I could buy my shoes from EastBay
Caught my case in a peak state
Fight nights to reach day
Nigga you wanted to see the light ('Lyt), you was battlin' to reach Day'
When you was in Phoenix takin' over, like Jean Grey
I was down and out, standin' out for count
Countin' down each day
When he don't like what a league say, he tag another league page
These weak plays
You got a nigga that complain about a battle drop verse a nigga that didn't complain about a release date
Niggas seem fake, and you took from Nu Jerooz style, we know what the fuck had happened
A bunch of habits, you know, the growly voice, shaky hands, writin' like him, a bunch of habits
A touch of Magic
You get on stage and perform with the dramatics
Everybody knows what you did with Twork's shit man it's so obvious
That's how the fuck this happened
Yeah, niggas wasn't surprised when we got this call
Cause they already know that you stole Summer Madness
The fuck has happened?
Nigga hide ya face, when you do good in battle rap, it's your style they decide to take
That's what happens when you establish great value Rum, just ask ya man Elijah Strait
You can't hide from Ace
Before you had all these designer clothes, Yak Man had you fitted like you was signed for sure
For a small check, dawg dressin' like a 9 year old
Cash appeals, his whole brand was dyin' slow
Every battle I watch this nigga with tees from Al Kapone
Now I'm up here puttin' a cig' (Sig) in ya shirt cause I hate when niggas advertise and smoke
You was thirsty for the look
For $500 you was the first person that they booked
You should've been starin' in a mirror
You would've been had Conceited by now if you was just only worried about ya looks
Get 30'd by a crook
I said, he was a Crip that joined Writer's Bloque for five minutes
Then was 4th Quarter, Team Homi, that was a side mission
When he joined EFB, I had to buy extensions
I'ma tell you why he different
Cause he the type to switch teams like five times
I'm the type that buy my team five switches
You supposed to lead and not follow
This nigga Rum be gettin' passed around like everybody put in on a bottle
My foot is on the throttle, and you can't touch none
Nigga you on everybody battle rap group as a plus one
Plus Rum, don't rap about none of that dumb shit where he come from
Hollow gave you a dum dum
Robbin' niggas, the goal was to hit enough licks, that you could eventually become one
Niggas come from, Insane, but I'm not the nigga you wanna confront
They put up front, you better hope your men'll help your mental health, after this metal melt ya metal up front
Slump somethin'
This the nigga that wanna punch with legends verses a nigga that'll really punch one
{chk-chk} I said pump one, heavy arms, dead site, the gun dump
The kick back, will kick you back
(Wherever the fuck you come from!)
I said niggas lack substance
What the fuck is a punch if it don't impact somethin'?
Nigga listen, this the difference
You gifted, but you a lazy parent on Christmas, you don't (w)rap nothin'
Ran from it, niggas didn't get no TLC like T-Boz and became MAC (Mack) dumpers
Fake yola, sellin' bootleg Cola; Black Compass
Waitin' for a bitch to volunteer and play; Pat Summitt
When I aim this I can't miss; Shaq dunkin'
Sold out OKC home game; pack Thunder
Fuck punchin' back to back
You ever had to fight with your back to back puncher?
Turn and got ya back punctured by the nigga that's supposed to have ya back, puncher?
They thought without no Shine on this card it was gon' be lackluster
They gave a nigga who doesn't drink Rum and thought I was gonna know to act sucka?
P, Beasley, y'all believe in me, thanks for havin' my back brother
Cause this shit is tragic, and I know for a fact that none ain't have it
I said, "none ain't have it", like Smack number
I said you punch in battles for oohs and aahs
I punch niggas in real life, you can view the scars
No Let Up, Baphomet, Cuz Webb, all that shit is super odd
Only name that fits him is "The Alien" cause he take off in every battle but we don't know who he are
Tell him to have a conversation wit' y'all

Rap, that's round

[Round 2: Rum Nitty]
If I pop the trunk you die bro
A lot of guns, let a hollow dump, ya mind blow
Try to bump, this .9 show
Body somethin'
You give me a shoulder, and I'ma give ya mama one...to cry on
Die slow
Then I'ma gasoline ya carcass, I'm an arsonist, char that bitch; awful
They gon' need dental records to solve this shit
If half ya body burnt, you can get identified by a tooth Ace (Two-Face) like Harvey Dent
Stop the shit, this nigga really fake
I give a fuck about that bid you did in that prison in them gates
Think he a killer when he ain't
You ain't tough cause you robbed an armored truck for Dead Presidents, this bitch'll lift up from the waist (waste)
Pistol whip, all this is finna break
They be stitchin' it in place
Puttin' it together, like Mike Tyson tattoo; assembling (a symbol in) his face
A get to trippin' out the gate
I told Beas', send direct payment, this man dead
I'ma hit the gun sto', for an SK and a MAC-10
Vest place and I grab lead
I went tool shoppin', like a hardware store, then I left Ace with a flat head (flathead)
You past dead
You 'bout to get all the smoke and take so many punches
(The fans yelling "Get off the ropes!")
Bitch try it, it's gon' be ya last bump, like Len Bias
Snap his arm, twist tied it, 'Get Your Roll On', big time (Big Tymers)
Tear the rotator cuff that's inside it
Just use a lotta strength when you hold it, and some body weight (somebody wait) on the shoulder, like a hitch hiker
Get did violent, violate
Snap his neck, head to side hangin', die mangled
These hands can break down anything Amin (I mean); sign language
.9 blaze it
Catch a body then I switch it
Shoot, then put the arm up for a minute; Sanaa Lathan
He tried to play me, that's something that he fell short for
You a battler?
[Ace] No
[Rum] Or a UFC fighter? We can't even tell no more
I got a shotgun and a SRT, you can catch a shell, your choice
You gon' make me get the sawed off from the Demon like Hellboy horns
Somebody better tell old boy, I'm just destined to be great
In each state, on a level that he ain't
Deadly how we play
Stay with it on me, testin' the heatwave
You'll see smoke comin' from the nose like an angry emoji...when the textin' a mean (TEC's in Amin) face
[?]
We'll really slide by a nigga set
Not a computer thug who play gangsta when this .9 fire, hit the deck
Or a round'll get stuck, it'll look like it'll be lines lyin' in your chest
It'll look like a pacemaker, you're dealin' with a live wire in the flesh
Bitch you next
You can't keep it real yourself
(Suicide or I'll do the job, you decide, kill yourself)

[Round 3: Ace Amin]

{Ace goes up to Sheed Happens}
Ayo. If he starts rappin' like that again. Punch him in his fuckin' face.  Punch him in his face. If he starts rappin' like that again. Punch him in his face. Punch him. Aight?

Let me talk to you for a second bro
Talk to you. Not Rum Nitty, not the fans. It's Cornell

In every time zone and language, real is the same
Every nigga act like they- man fuck that Crip, you wanna know what's really Insane?
They say I use a lot of words, but I couldn't when they put me in back of the Crown
Pattin' me down, the package wasn't found so I stashed the rest in my teeth, behind the back of the crown
I'm mad as shit
But I don't wanna get caught so all I could manage was frowns
If you ever had to hide your own work in ya mouth, then you know why a nigga like Ace ain't never crackin' (crack in) a smile
Do you know what's really Insane, nigga?
Huh? Breakin' the law
Nah, I mean breakin' the law so much you start to think it's a sport
Hangin' it all on the line 'til you can't get support
Then you end up fightin' a case tougher than anybody Mayweather fought
When they said I had John John and Cortez I started throwin' up
Flashbacks
What really is insane, I thought I was gonna be in The Bullpen waitin' for Cort' (court)
Do you know what's really Insane nigga?
Having to fake play crazy so the state time can't take it out of me
Watchin' the doctors show when they come up to examine me like Grey's Anatomy
Fake outbursts, a bunch lame profanity
You might know everything, I wasn't raised in a gang or family
So you gonna tell me all about the set you claim, but you can't tell me nothin' about havin' to go to court to claim insanity
Do you know what's really Insane nigga?
This the truth
When I went missin' last year my sanity went missin' too
Livin' through, the weirdest shit, hearin' shit, wakin' up like I don't know where this is, and I have to fix my mood
In addition to, havin' to get permission to
Wantin' to kill myself from people in my head that I never knew
So when you say, "Suicide, you decide" or you "do the job", bitch I don't even know which voice to listen to
Do you know what's really Insane nigga?
Aye Smack, we gotta talk a bit
Cause your company fast talked me like an auctioneer, awful shit
I'm talkin' they said they was gonna help get me in a mental health facility, they offered it
KD researched it, then they gave me a call, said they ran into a problem quick
Then Beasley sat me down, and said, "Hey Ace, I know we agreed that we was gonna pay for half, but now the offer switched."
...Nah it ain't one of them type of rounds
They some real niggas, instead of payin' half them niggas said they gon' pay all of it
I know y'all convinced that they hold us back and they don't help me out
I told them I needed a battle for my mental health
They booked me for two of 'em in a row, them niggas held me down
See I never said this, and never addressed it, but everything I ever got here I rapped for
Smack is not my blood brother, Beasley is not my cousin, them hatin' niggas got that wrong
But them same hatin' battle rappers that run with that shit
Man, they would smack they cousin and call Beas' they "brother" just to rap on this platform
I ain't got no rap for 'em
Aye Smack, I know you sick of niggas goin' public and your name you can't help defend, so I'ma do it
Tell 'em how many times you moved niggas to new states and you helped 'em in
[Smack] A lot
[Ace] How many times did you know shit you wasn't supposed to know about niggas and you held it in
How many times did you pay niggas bail, and when it was time to pay they debt, them niggas bailed again
Keep it real my friend
My niggas that's over there, headlining Max Out where did they start?
Surf with no thirds and "subtitles" where did it start?
Jaz virginity, Don DeMarco? Where did it start?
Niggas act like they don't know who number one is, but I'ma remind y'all where the shit start
See the problem is, money talks, and niggas can't fake their worth
Since 2021, URL has had 88 events
My nigga you could put nothin' in the place of work
But niggas that don't understand value, they think spendin' money on names is what makes it work
Them niggas got a Zerox machine, they tryin' to copy respect, but they just gonna run outta paper first
Let's make this work
Aye Smack, from here on out, we don't fool wit' these niggas
We are 100% through with these niggas
I don't care where they from or who went to school wit' these niggas
We don't fool wit' these niggas
Put a tool on these niggas
If they got Ill words for you, ask 'em, "Who are these niggas?"
I said, you don't even have to speak on it
Fuck all the back and forth, I'm just glad that we had this talk
Pass the Glock, show me where ARP at, I'ma make all this madness stop
I'm startin' at the top
Hammer cocked
Ragnarök
Blast a shot
Damage spots
It's like Hiroshima, ain't gonna be no war after I make Adam (Atom) drop!
Your status not, where you think it's at, niggas stop the cap
If you into cockin' straps, pocket taps, gun bars where he got the #1 spot in fact
I need y'all to treat this shit like a FitBit, please go home and watch the App
We ain't stoppin' that
Round man
I'm out here

[Round 3: Rum Nitty]
They'd rather sit back and hate than congratulate
And fabricate like I'm average, and my numbers on the App is fake
But the ones that y'all had as "great" can't match the pace
That's what the stats'll say
I can quit rap today
Go give my life to God, return, get a Welcome Back, still be ranked past 'em Ace (Pastor Ma$e)
These facts I state
But you don't gotta speak when your numbers talkin'
In Corona season, we gave y'all roof top battles for the low, and that's somethin' that my brother started
When y'all first stopped releasin' on YouTube, and wasn't nothin' droppin'
I was in "go mode"
I held the App down for so long I could've uninstalled it
My App record? Second to none, damn near fuckin' flawless
I made that effort, you can't compare it to niggas like Ace's App (A$AP) record, it's 'A Fuckin' Problem'
See what you started, you just come with drama
Perform, then bring out a baby bump, who knocked up Rihanna?
Up the chopper, try and test me
Heater get to sparkin', I fire steady
Ain't nothin' sweet about this carbon, it's a Diet Pepsi
Break down bones in ya features; Mariah Carey
Arm shot, bones sittin' on the outside like Mike Amiri
You dyin' really, I can spin it backwards
You'll get smoked thinkin' shit is a joke, I ain't with the laughin'
Catch you right after the event, and get to clappin'
See if it's still humorous (humerus) outside like an Amiri jacket
We really active
I ain't even playin' no more
A little compact Glock with a 30, I snuck it straight through those doors
I ain't playin' no more
Soon as he go for the bump a (bumper), a stick'll (sticker) get used, I got the baby on board
Aye, that's what the gang is known for
This finna be a bad encounter
Certain shit I can't allow it
Two piece, put you right to sleep, that's a downer
Grab him, slam this coward
Who's strong enough to throw Ace through a wall? I got Gambit power
You'll get clapped for doubtin'
Say goodbye
Losin' HP on the gateway to the gracious sky
The EKG machine like a laptop, just pull the plug and Ace'll die
Say goodbye
Fuckin' fool
Bust a move
You be actin' like you a professional hitman, that ain't nothin' new
But I heard a battle rapper was actin' tough and got punked
Was it you?
I heard the other nigga put blood all in ya mouth
Was it true (Tru)?
Fuck is you?
I've been known
As I was makin' flips before I touched the big screen like a Sprint phone
Go upside ya bitch dome
Black her eye
She gotta wear a mean (Amin) dark pair of shades like Jim Jones
Try that bump again
Not by the hairs of my - like an ingrown
I'll let a stick blow
Get you murdered, ditch the burner
I'm doin' life if they catch me
They tryin' to give me time for a weapon like the Prince Of Persia
Bitch you earned it
You can't keep it real yourself-
