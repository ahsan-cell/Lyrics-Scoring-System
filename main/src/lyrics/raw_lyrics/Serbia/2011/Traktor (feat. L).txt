The mirror can't look me in my eyes, no way
I float like a ribbon in the sky, no plane
Aye look, smooth or rugged I'mma Usain run it
Cause I does it in my own lane
And I'mma flash for the picture
She'll come back no hasta la vista
Computer love, I Mac with my finger
Baby I'm a man, not your Mister, I missed you-

[Pre-Hook: Wretch 32]
My lifestyle's terribly wild, but you'll never catch me on a Jeremy Kyle show
Explosive, terrorist style, don't think I'mma blow I'll get you therapy now, woah

[Hook: L Marshall]
I missed school and I haven't got a job yet
My girl's pissed and my daughter's on the way
I went clubbing till my world was revolving
Pretty women and alcohol, ay
I ride this motherfucking beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfucking beat like a train
Choo-choo, go hard, go faster, stack P's every day
I ride this motherfucking beat like a tractor
I ride this motherfucking beat like a plane
Zoom zoom down the rabbit hole
More women, more alcohol, ay

I'm living my life cause that's what I do best
These girls on my bank wanna show me interest
Aye, look pounds or pennies
I don't scrounge off any, I'm fly I am not an insect
And I'm the life of the party
Came with Ken but I left with his Barbie
Baby's with me, she can ride in the car seat
If she's an angel, I'm Charlie, ah please

Don't say my name when I'm at the bar, so gone
Cause I'm in the zone and I'm trying my hardest not to fall, so gone
And I'm so gone, so gone, I'm so gone, so gone
Just leave me alone, alone
