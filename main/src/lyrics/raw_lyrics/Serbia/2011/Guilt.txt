[Hook]
Sometimes I don't know where we're going
Sometimes I feel you should be crawling back to me
Time is ticking by without us knowing
Before you know it, it will be too late to see
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You try to fake it but you're breaking every rule
Right from the start you've always made me feel a fool
The guilt you hide will come between us after all

[Chorus]
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all

[Buildup]
Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all
Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all
(Sense at all, sense at all, sense at all, sense at all...)

[Hook]
Sometimes I don't know where we're going
Sometimes I feel you should be crawling back to me
Time is ticking by without us knowing
Before you know it, it will be too late to see
You keep on talking but it makes no sense at all
You try to fake it but you're breaking every rule
Right from the start you've always made me feel a fool
The guilt you hide will come between us after all

Time is ticking by without us knowing (Knowing, knowing...)
