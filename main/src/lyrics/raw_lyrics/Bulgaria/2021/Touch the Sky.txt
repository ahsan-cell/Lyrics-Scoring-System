I can just say
I just can say "salaam"

Under the desert stars, I'm ridin' all alone
A thousand miles or more, and I've got to go
I'm goin' round and round, my town is far away
I cannot even believe

What I see, facing me
Is comin' out from nowhere
Baby, it's a real blue man
Smilin' to me, oh boy what can I do
I just can say "salaam"

What a dream, one night in Arabia
You touch the sky and feel a woman
What a man, tonight in Arabia
He makes me feel like dyin' really

It's gettin' very dark, predators all around
The silver moon above and my camel goes
I'm goin' round and round and my ghibli blows away
I cannot even believe

What I see, facing me
Is comin' out from nowhere
Baby, it's a real blue man
Smilin' to me, oh boy what can I do
I just can say "salaam"
