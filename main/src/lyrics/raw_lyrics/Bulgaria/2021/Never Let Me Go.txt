You opened the door for me, the air was warm
The kinda breeze you feel right before the storm
I left that tame impala record, and I don't doubt that you've still got it in your drawer even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost on the interstate
All our walls falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I know it's long gone and frankly I've moved on
So I might be okay, but it don't take long

[Chorus]
Till' there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red while you were singing out of key
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
All your books up on the counter
Said you'd sleep when you were dead
You used to be a little kid with glasses
Now you're in over your head
And you're telling me the truth about you
And it's hard to believe you'd trust me
With your past swearing your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy," always talking loud and claim it's so profound
But God I wish you would've said it
Do you regret it?
When you look at me now, do you wish you'd turned around?
Before our light was dead and buried
Check the texts, you'd come back swearing it's the same after three months in the grave
And then you wondered why I went for him instead
Now it's too late to say you've changed
Cuz there's no one else to blame
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget that you broke me in two

[Chorus]
Cuz there we are again in the middle of the night
We're trying to find our clothes using your phone flasing light
Up the stairs, you were there, you remember it all too well, yeah
And there we are again when nobody had to know
I said, "I shouldn't stay"
You said, "I better get you home"
I was there, said you'd swear to remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I gave too much
But, baby, you called me a masterpiece then went and tore it all up
Running scared, you were there
I remember it all too well
When you asked to be my friend it fucking broke me like your promise
So casually cruel, baby while we're being honest
You're a master of deceit there's no denying here
Cuz you were leading me on, on, on

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends
But I'm in a new hell everytime I think of all your lies
You said if you had been closer to LA
Maybe we would have that life
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
Won't mind you're needy, perfect, blonde and cool
Whose shine reflets on you
Not weeping on the drive to Nashville
My mother asking me what happened, you
That's what happened you
You who charmed my friend with self-effacing jokes
Swore that when you'd have me you would never let me go
But then she watched me walk her front door falling to my knees
And it took everything in her, not to make a scene
[Verse 5]
How time flies, when you're not paralyzed by it
Used to like my old self then, but I don't think she'd mind that
I've been writing new stories and coming into my own
And I let myself fall and I fixed what you broke
And he doesn't hold me back or make a promise he can't keep
Cuz everybody knows you only do that when you're weak but I've forgiven it
'Cause I remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the greatest thing you'd ever know
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Up the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
"You're at NASA and you finally have your space"
Oh how the tables turn, now I think you've learn
I write songs about the months you had to waste
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's sunny glow
Your memory is cold as snow
And if you listen you can tell
I remember it all too well
[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it all too
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Up the stairs, I was there, I was there
It was rare, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Just between us, just between us
All too well, I remember it all too well
