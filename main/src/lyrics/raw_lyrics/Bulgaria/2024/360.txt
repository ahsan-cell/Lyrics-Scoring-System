I went my own way and I made it
I'm your favorite reference, baby
Call me Gabbriette, you're so inspired
Ah, ah
I'm tectonic, moves, I make 'em
Shock you like defibrillators
No style? I can't relate
I'll always be the one, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop down, yeah
Put the camera flash on
So stylish
Baby tee is all gone
Drop down, yeah
Lookin' like an icon
Work angles, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, 360
When you're in the mirror, do you like what you see?
When you're in the mirror, you're just looking at me
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah
When you're in the party b-b-bumpin' that beat
666 with a princess streak
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah

[Verse 2]
That city sewer slut's the vibe
Internationally recognized
I set the tone, it's my design
And it's stuck in your mind
Legacy is undebated
You gon' jump if A. G. made it
If you love it, if you hate it
I don't fucking care what you think

[Pre-Chorus]
Drop down, yeah
Put the camera flash on
So stylish
Baby tee is all gone
Drop down, yeah
Lookin' like an icon
Work angles, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, 360
When you're in the mirror, do you like what you see?
When you're in the mirror, you're just looking at me
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah
When you're in the party b-b-bumpin' that beat
666 with a princess streak
I'm everywhere, I'm so Julia
Ah-ah, ah
[Outro]
