Tough like the scuff on a pair of old leather boots
Like the blue-collar, red-dirt attitude
Like a .38 made out of brass
Tough like the stuff in your grandpa's glass
Life's gonna do what it does
Sure as the good Lord's up above
I'm cut like a diamond shinin' in the rough
Tough
Tough

[Verse 1: Quavo, Quavo & Lana Del Rey]
Come on, take a ride with me
Like the 808s beatin' in the trunk in Atlanta, it was tough
It was kinda hard for me
Crawlin' through the mud, I couldn't find love, then we came up
Look at what we are, baby
Standin' through the storm, still shinin' like a diamond in the rough
Still shinin', and that's hard
If you ever lost someonе that you love

[Pre-Chorus: Quavo]
Through the pain, gotta show 'em, givе 'em light
Still family if you're wrong or you're right
No matter, we together
It's not somethin' that you wanna do, it's just somethin' you goin' through

Tough like the scuff on a pair of old leather boots
Like the blue-collar, red-dirt attitude
Like a .38 made out of brass
Tough like the stuff in your grandpa's glass (Grandpa's glass)
Life's gonna do what it does (Ooh)
Sure as the good Lord's up above
I'm cut like a diamond shinin' in the rough (Shine, shine)
Tough
Hard

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey, Quavo, Lana Del Rey & Quavo]
Tell me how it's hard for you
Like the nickel-wound strings on your good old Gibson guitar
Tell me what it feel like
Like the smoke in the drawl of your "Y'all" and the way you talk slow
Oh yeah, yeah
Like the songs that your mama sang to you
And the way that it makes you tell the truth
If you come from where you come, then you were born tough

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey & Quavo]
Here, say where you come from
It's not what you wanna do, it's what you're gonna do
Now, it's no place to run
If that's what you're gonna do, what am I gonna do? (Tough)
[Chorus: Quavo & Lana Del Rey, Quavo, Lana Del Rey]
Tough like the scuff on a pair of old leather boots
Like the blue-collar, red-dirt attitude (Yeah, yeah)
Like a .38 made out of brass
Tough like the stuff in your grandpa's glass (Grandpa's glass)
Life's gonna do what it does (Ooh)
Sure as the good Lord's up above
I'm cut like a diamond shinin' in the rough (Shine, shine)
Tough

[Outro: Quavo & Lana Del Rey]
You wanna come to the Nawf? (Mm-hm)
I'll show you around
That's why I said, "Come take a ride with me"
When?
Whenever, whenever you ready
Call on me, brr
I'll give it back when I get there
Aight, that's a bet15
