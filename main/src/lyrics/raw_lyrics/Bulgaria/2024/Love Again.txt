I miss the way we’d make up
Been way too long now since I felt your lips
I don’t know when we lost it
I hope we’re still something we can fix

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we were something real special
Somehow we messed it all up yeah
I don’t know how we got here, but
I started thinking cause

[Chorus]
If we could learn to love again
We wouldn’t have to think about the end
If we could learn to love again
Fuck it and just forget the things we said
I takе back the hurt that I gave you
I don’t want to miss it all
If we could lеarn to love again
We wouldn’t have to think about the end

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could wake up
And you would still be lying next to me
Then maybe I could show you
Just how good we really used to be
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Cause we were something real special
Somehow we messed it all up yeah
I don’t know how we got here, but
I started thinking cause

[Chorus]
If we could learn to love again
We wouldn’t have to think about the end
If we could learn to love again
Fuck it and just forget the things we said
I take back the hurt that I gave you
I don’t want to miss it all
If we could learn to love again
We wouldn’t have to think about the end
If we could learn to love again
We wouldn’t have to think about the end
If we could learn to love again
Fuck it and just forget the things we said
I take back the hurt that I gave you
I don’t want to miss it all
If we could learn to love again
We wouldn’t have to think about the end
