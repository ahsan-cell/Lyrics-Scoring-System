Love me, love me, love me
Mm

[Verse 1]
Oh, hey
Boy with your hat back
Mm, I kinda like that
If you wanna walk my way
I'ma shoot you straight up
Show me what you're made of

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't have time to waste on the boys
That are playin' the games
And leavin' the girls cryin' out in the rain
So tell me, baby
Do you got what it takes?

[Chorus]
If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leavin'
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
Baby, if you're not, you best get to leavin'
If you're gonna love me, love me like you mean it (Like you mean it)
If you're gonna talk the talk, you better walk it
If you wanna keep me, keep me like you lost it
If you're gonna say it, make me believe it
If you're gonna love me, boy, love me like you mean it

Oh, hey
I've had my share of losers, liars and users
Lookin' for a heart to break

Well, take a step back

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I don't have time to waste on the boys

So tell me, baby
Are you just crazy or crazy over me?

If you're gonna hold me, hold me like I'm leavin'
If you're gonna kiss me, kiss me like you need it
