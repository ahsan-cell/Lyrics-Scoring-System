On paper, we go together
I know that we look the part
But almost never hangs on forever
I know I'm breakin' your heart

[Pre-Chorus]
So go on, say what you want to
I'm not gonna stop you
You can blame it all on me, mm

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was
Mm-mm

[Verse 2]
Wish I could feel about ya
The way you feel about me
But you can't make a heart say somethin'
That it don't believe

So go on, hate me if you have to
I hate myself, too
'Cause as much as I wanna be

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was

[Pre-Chorus]
Go on, hate me if you have to
I still care about you
Mm, as much as I wanna be

[Chorus]
I'm not the hero in the story
I'm not the girl that gets the glory
'Cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Oh, 'cause you're lookin' for true love
And I'm not the one
But I wish, but I wish I was
Mm, I wish, oh, I wish I was
