Baby blue staring in the window pane just counting drops of rain
Wondering if she’s got the guts to take it
Running down her dreams in a dirty dress, now her heart’s a mess
Praying  she will find a way to make it

[Chorus: Maddie & Tae]
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

[Verse 2: Maddie & Tae]
Searching for a sign in the night, even like a lonely string of lights
That’ll burn just long enough for you to see it
The road’s been long and lonely and you feel like giving up
There’s more to this than just the breath you’re breathing

[Chorus: Maddie & Tae]
So keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down
On the way down

[Bridge: Maddie & Tae]
You won’t forget the heavy steps it took to let it go
Close your eyes, count to ten, hold your breath
And fly
You might also like[Chorus: Maddie & Tae]
Keep on climbing, though the ground might shake
Just keep on reaching though the limb might break
We’ve come this far, don’t you be scared now
Cause you can learn to fly on the way down

[Outro: Maddie & Tae]
Ohh-oh, oh-oh
Fly
