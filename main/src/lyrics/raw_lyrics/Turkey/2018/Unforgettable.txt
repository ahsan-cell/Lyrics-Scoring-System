It was the 14th of October, had that T-shirt off your shoulder
I was drunk, said I was sober and you said, "Yeah, right"
We were talkin' for a minute, then some guy tried to cut in
You took my hand and we pretended like I was your guy

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, and I tried to guess your middle name
For thirty minutes, bet we played that game

[Chorus]
That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Verse 2]
We were dancin', we were buzzin', takin' shots like it was nothin'
Did the runnin' man, you loved it, yeah, you laughed out loud
You brushed away your blonde hair and you kissed me out of nowhere
I can still show you the spot where everything went down

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, I told you I was gonna marry you
You probably didn't think that it was true
See Thomas Rhett LiveGet tickets as low as $33You might also like[Chorus]
That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, that night was just like you, baby
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I can taste the mango-rita you were drinkin'
And it feels just like it was last weekend
That we jumped in right off the deep end

[Chorus 2]
That mango-rita you were drinkin'
And that Coldplay song that you were singin'
And I bet right now you're probably thinkin'
That it's crazy I remember every detail, but I do
I can still smell your perfume
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable
[Outro]
From your blue jeans to your shoes
Girl, that night was just like you
Unforgettable6
