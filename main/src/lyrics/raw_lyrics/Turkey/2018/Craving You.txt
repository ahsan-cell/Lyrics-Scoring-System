Oh

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
Every time we have to say goodbye
I'm countin' down until we say hello
Every touch is like the strongest drug
I don't know how much longer I can go

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I never had somethin' that I can't walk away from
Well, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience
There's somethin' 'bout you, girl, I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of hundred-proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin'
That feelin' when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin' you
Cravin' you

All the in-between is killin' me
You know I come unglued from missin' you
Sunset eyes, no, I don't have to try
Because you know exactly what to do

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Maren Morris & Both]
I never had somethin' that I can't walk away from (Walk away from)
Well, girl, my self-control's so paralyzed
When it comes to you, no, I ain't got no patience (I ain't got no patience)
There's somethin' 'bout you I just can't fight

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett & Maren Morris, Maren Morris]
You're like that cigarette
That shot of hundred-proof
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin'
That feelin' when we kiss
The way your body moves
No matter how much I get
I'm always cravin' you
Cravin' you (I'm always cravin' you)
Cravin' you (Oh, oh)
Cravin' you
