Summertime, it was always a vibe
You and I, in the heat of the night, drinking
Tequila and lime with you on the side, thinking
This is the life, just as long as you're mine
From making love to making you mad
To picking fights in the back of a cab when
We start shit then we're taking it back
And just like that I was making you laugh

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can't even get a reaction
I can feel you pushing away
What happened to the love and passion we had?

[Chorus]
And when did you get so cold?
And when did we lose that heat?
I'm waiting 'till you come home
And every time, I'm thinking you might
I'm losing my mind alone
Don't tell me I'm all you need
When you lie next to me
'Cause every night, you put me on ice
Oh when did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
When did you get so-
You might also like[Verse 2]
Over it, I'm the enemy
We go to bed and we don't even speak, what?
This is it? I can take it or leave us
Stick around and just hope you don't freeze us

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't even get a reaction
I can feel you pushing away
What happened to the love and passion we had?

[Chorus]
And when did you get so cold?
And when did we lose that heat?
I'm waiting 'till you come home
And every time, I'm thinking you might
I'm losing my mind alone
Don't tell me I'm all you need
When you lie next to me
'Cause every night, you put me on ice
Oh when did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
When did you get so-

And when did you get so cold?
And when did we lose that heat?
I'm waiting 'till you come home
And every time, I'm thinking you might
I'm losing my mind alone
Don't tell me I'm all you need
When you lie next to me
'Cause every night, you put me on ice
Oh when did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
[Outro]
When did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
When did you get so, cold?
