Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1]
She was walking in the street, looked up and noticed
He was nameless, he was homeless
She asked him his name and told him what hers was
He gave her a story 'bout life
With a glint in his eye and a corner of a smile
One conversation, a simple moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
She's riding in a taxi back to the kitchen
Talking to the driver 'bout his wife and his children
On the run from a country where they put you in prison
For being a woman and speaking your mind
She looked in his eyes in the mirror and he smiled
One conversation, a single moment
The things that change us if we notice
When we look up sometimes

[Pre-Chorus]
They said I would never make it
But I was built to break the mold
The only dream that I've been chasing is my own

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come
Young teachers, student doctors
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
Everybody rise up
You gonna rise up, ayy

[Chorus]
So I sing a song for the hustlers trading at the bus stop
Single mothers waiting on a check to come (Say you're gonna make it)
Young teachers, student doctors (Yeah)
Sons on the front line knowing they don't get to run
This goes out to the underdog
Keep on keeping at what you love
You'll find that someday soon enough
You will rise up, rise up, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh10
