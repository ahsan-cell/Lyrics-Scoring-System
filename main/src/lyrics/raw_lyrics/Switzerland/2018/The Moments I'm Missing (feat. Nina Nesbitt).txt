I had a dream
I had a dream when I was only five
To work at a bar, I wanted to see over the other side
And I had a friend, her name was Fern and she had a blue bike
So we'd ride through the streets
I would sleep over on Saturday nights
Then I went to school
My family moved to a village near by
At thirteen years old I started drawing black under my eyes
'Cause I met a boy, first time I kissed him on the lip was the last
'Cause I got afraid when everyone there started moving too fast

[Post-Verse]
Moving too fast, moving too fast, moving too fast, moving too fast
Moving too fast, moving too fast, moving too fast...

[Pre-Drop]
Everyone there started moving too fast

[Drop]
I had a dream
I had a dream when I was only five
To work at a bar, I wanted to see over the other side
And I had a friend, her name was Fern and she had a blue bike
So we'd ride through the streets
I would sleep over on Saturday nights
Then I went to school
My family moved to a village near by
At thirteen years old I started drawing black under my eyes
'Cause I met a boy, first time I kissed him on the lip was the last
'Cause I got afraid when everyone there started moving too fast

I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream
I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream, I had a dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream...

[Chorus]
These are the moments
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I never took in when
I was just standing there wishing
I could grow up and my life would be different
These are the moments I miss
These are the moments
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments

[Bridge]
'Cause I've been so caught in the motions
Forgotten where my home is
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh

[Outro]
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing
These are the moments I'm missing1
