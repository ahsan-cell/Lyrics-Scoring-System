And if the world would end tomorrow
We don't care tonight, tonight
And if the world would end tomorrow
Just put your hands up, and feel alright

[Interlude: Patrick Miller & Evelyn]
Alright
Put your hands up, 2012
Haha
Yeah
Yeah, because we don't care tonight
Just put your hands up and feel alright (let's go)

[Chorus: Evelyn]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, 2012 when the world will end
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, 2012 when we make it stand

[Verse: Patrick Miller & Evelyn]
Come on, Maya said, 2012 is the end
They think that's God's plan
Explosion for waters so I guess we don't care what's to heal
Of the chain we make it stand, never give up
Nobody can't stop that's right can't trust them (Yeah)
Move to the top, that's how we roll
Don't mind, just keep on going
If the world would end tomorrow
Listen to the song that change sorrow
Into joy [?]
I wanna hear you make some noise!
Tonight is the night to feel free
What's gonna happen?
We will see
[?]
2012, just follow me (Oh)

[Chorus: Evelyn]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, 2012 when the world will end
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, 2012 when we make it stand

[Interlude: Evelyn & Patrick Miller]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
2012
Ohh, when the world will end
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Because we don't care tonight
We make it stand, put your hands up
And if the world would end tomorrow (Tomorrow)
We don't care tonight, tonight
And if the world would end tomorrow
Just put your hands up, and feel alright (Let's go)

[Chorus: Evelyn]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, 2012 when the world will end
