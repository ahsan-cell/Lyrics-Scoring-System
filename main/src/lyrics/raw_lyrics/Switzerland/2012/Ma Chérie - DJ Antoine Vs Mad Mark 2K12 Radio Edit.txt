We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma chérie
Never seen a girl, that's so jolie
All I want is you, you're ma chérie
Ma Chérie
Oh oh oh ooh!

[Verse 1]
When I look into your eyes
I see rainbows in the skies
Baby when you're close to me
I know you are ma chérie
Oh!

[Chorus]
We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma chérie
Never seen a girl, that's so jolie
All I want is you, you're ma chérie
Ma Chérie
Oh oh oh ooh!

[Verse 2]
We don't need to run or hide
I'll be there to hold your tight
You and me, we are on fire
Ma chérie, you are my desire
Oh!
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We are gonna dance, into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma chérie

[Chorus]
We are gonna dance into the sea
All I want is you, you're ma chérie
Never seen that girl that's so jolie
All I want is you, you're ma chérie

[Post-Chorus]
I will take you higher
I will take you higher
I will take you higher

[Outro]
You're my love
You're ma chérie3
