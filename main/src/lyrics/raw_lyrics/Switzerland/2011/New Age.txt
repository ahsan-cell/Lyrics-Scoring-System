If love was a word, I don't understand
Simplest sound, with four letters
Whatever it was, I'm over it now
With every day, it gets better (it gets better)

[Chorus]
Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on
Whatever it was, whatever it was
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age

[Verse 2]
I'm walking away, from everything I had
I need a room with new colours
There was a time, when I didn't mind living the life of others

[Chorus]
Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on
Whatever it was, whatever it was
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age

So much fire that it burned my wings
Her heat was amazing
Now I'm dreaming of the simple things
Old ways, erased

[Verse 3]
If love was a word, I don't understand
The simplest sound,with four letters

[Chorus]
Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on
Whatever it was, whatever it was
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age

Are you loving the pain, loving the pain?
And with everyday, everyday
I try to move on
Whatever it was, whatever it was
There's nothing now
You changed
New Age1
