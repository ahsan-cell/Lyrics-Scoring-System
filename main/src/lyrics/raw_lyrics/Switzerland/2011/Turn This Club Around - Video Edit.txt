Turn this club around
Ayo, ayo

[Verse 1: U-Jean]
If you want more
Just check my swagger out there on the dance floor
Yeah, all the ladies gonna knock on my door
Gonna be the time of your life
We're gonna do it tonight-ah
Do it tonight-ah

[Pre-Chorus: U-Jean]
Something's heatin' up, heatin' up, go check my flow
Hey, meet me up, meet me up on the V.I.P. floor
DJ speed it up, speed it up, play it loud
We gonna turn this club around

[Chorus: U-Jean]
We gonna make all bitches work it on the floor
Wanna see my sexy ladies, screamin': "Gimme more"
Yeah, we can turn this club around, gonna burn it-burn it down
Singin': "Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo"
Go models, rock that booty, make me lose my mind
My rocket's loaded with champagne every Saturday night
Yeah, we can turn this club around, gonna burn it-burn it down
Singin': "Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo"
