It's late in the evenin', glass on the side
I've been sat with you for most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know if you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we've got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, "It's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
If you love me, come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh

[Chorus]
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Louder
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Sing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
[Bridge]
(Can you feel it?)
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
(Can you feel it?)
All that I can hear is music from the back
(Can you feel it?)
I found you hidin' here, so won't you take my hand, darlin'
Before the beat kicks in again?
Can you feel it?
Ooh-ah-pa
Can you feel it?
Ah-no-no-no-oh, oh-no-woah

[Chorus]
Sing
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) I need you, darling, come on, set the tone
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) If you feel you're fallin', won't you let me know?
Louder
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Sing
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) If you love me, come on, get involved
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Louder
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh (Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh-ooh, oh-ooh
