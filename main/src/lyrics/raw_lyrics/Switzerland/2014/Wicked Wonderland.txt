[Pre-Chorus]
Can you see the flickering lights, baby?
Put your glass up in the air, with me
Hollar hollar, let them hear us, loudly
Our top is off, let's show them off proudly

[Chorus]
Wicked, wicked Wonderland
It's like crossing the Rio Grande
You gotta have the cash in store
To reappear on our front door
Wicked, wicked Wonderland
It's like crossing the Rio Grande
You gotta have the cash in store
To reappear on our front door
