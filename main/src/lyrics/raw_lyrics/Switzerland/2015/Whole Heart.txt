We got problems in the streets again
Drowning in the violence, it's getting pretty tense
A lot of hunger in the faces I see
A lot of bitterness, communal emptiness

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense

[Chorus]
I said, woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
Woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
We got issues that we can't change
Quickly as we'd like to, as we need to
And I'm worried it will backspin
Pulling out the linchpin, leaving us victims
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense

[Chorus]
I said, woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
Woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart

[Drop]
I said, woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go

[Bridge]
Head first, past the point of no return
It's the only way left to go
Can't keep talking while the years go by
Gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart
You gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart this time
[Chorus]
I said, woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
Woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go

[Post-Chorus]
I said, woo-hoo
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Woo-hoo
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart3
