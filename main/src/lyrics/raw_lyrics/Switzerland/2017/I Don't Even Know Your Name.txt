Oh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
Oh, woah

[Verse 2]
You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
And then you were gone
Oh, woah, yeah

[Chorus]
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name

[Verse 3]
Ooh, everywhere that I go
I see your face, and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone
Yeah, I can't stop thinking 'bout you

[Bridge]
I'm runnin', I'm searchin', and I don't know where to start
I'm dyin', my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking 'til I hold you in my arms
'Cause I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
I'm runnin', I'm searchin', and I don't know where to start
I'm dyin', my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking 'til I hold you in my arms
'Cause I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'

[Chorus]
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me everyday
'Cause I don't even know your name20
