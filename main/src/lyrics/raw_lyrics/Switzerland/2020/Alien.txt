I'm feelin' like an alien, baby
Ridin' around the world
I'm feeling like a stranger, baby
‘Round and around we go

[Verse 1]
Where did I come from? Where do I go?
I'm so far away from home
What am I goin' for? How can I know
What I'm fightin' for

[Chorus]
I'm feelin' like an alien, baby
Ridin' around the world
I'm feeling like a stranger, baby
‘Round and around we go
‘Round and around we go

[Post-Chorus]
‘Round and around we go
And around we go

[Verse 2]
So where can I go?
A million miles from home
What am I goin' for? How can I know
What I'm fightin' for
