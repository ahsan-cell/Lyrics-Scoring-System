You, me, honestly, we don't need no therapy
Just live it up, just live it
Love me crazy, we'll be who we wanna be
Just live it up, just live it

I'll be your only remedy
And if we get too high, falling right through the ceiling
Remember what you said to me?

And if we get too high, falling right through the ceiling
Remember what you said to me?
