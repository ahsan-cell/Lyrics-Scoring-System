We used to be giants (Ooh-ooh)
When did we stop? (Ooh-ooh)
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

[Verse 1]
The hope and the hurt
Has lived inside of me (Ooh-ooh)
But there's gold in the dirt
I never took the time to see (Ooh-ooh)
But I knew of its worth
When you walked beside of me (Ooh-ooh)
And my hand fit in yours
Like a bird would find the breeze

[Chorus]
We used to be giants (Ooh-ooh)
When did we stop? (Ooh-ooh)
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot
We were the song in the silence (Ooh-ooh)
But time catches up (Ooh-ooh)
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

I knew from the start
You'd be the one to set me free (Ooh-ooh)
That day in the park
When the hurt would hide from me (Ooh-ooh)
Those eyes used to know me, it's been way too long
You are the moon and the stars, and all they gaze upon (Ooh-ooh)
Time won't ever move slowly, what you waiting on?
Yeah, what you waiting on?

[Chorus]
We used to be giants (Ooh-ooh)
When did we stop? (Ooh-ooh)
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot
We were the song in the silence (Ooh-ooh)
But time catches up (Ooh-ooh)
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot, yeah

[Bridge]
Darlin' (I still love you, though)
Just say you will (I still love you, though)
Will you remember those times (I still love you, though)
That I have held until (I still love you, though)
Tonight? (I still love you, though)
If you say you will (I still love you, though)
I'll leave it all behind (I still love you, though)
Don't you remember those times? (I still love you, though)
[Chorus]
We used to be giants
So, when did we stop?
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot
We were the song in the silence (Ooh-ooh)
But time catches up (Ooh-ooh)
Just say the word and I'll be yours
You know I never forgot

[Outro]
We used to be giants (Ooh-ooh)
Giants (Ooh-ooh, I still love you, though)
Oh, I still love you, though (Ooh-ooh)
I still love you, though (Ooh-ooh)
