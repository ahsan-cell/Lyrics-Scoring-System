[Intro: Nico Santos]
(Ru-Running back oh-oh)
(Running back to, running back to you)

[Verse 1: Nico Santos]
When you needed me the most
Oh, that's when I turned up the least
Oh, I wish you let me know
But then I get, I'd probably press delete

[Pre-Chorus: Nico Santos]
I should've called you that night
I should've got a little less high
I should've told you just one more time
One more

[Chorus: Nico Santos]
Why did I keep lying to myself
When I was chasing someone else?
Oh, when I should've known that
I'd be running back to you
Why was I just too blind to tell?
And now you're out with someone else
Oh, darling, I should'vе known that
I'd be running back to you

Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back to you
Running back, oh-oh, running back to
Running back to, running back
Running back, oh-oh, running back to
Running back to you

[Verse 2: Nico Santos]
Why do I see your ghost
And everything I don't wantеd to leave?
Is it too late to learn if I promise
I could love you differently

[Pre-Chorus: Nico Santos]
I should've called you that night
I should've got a little less high
I should've told you just one more time
One more

[Chorus: Nico Santos]
Why did I keep lying to myself
When I was chasing someone else?
Oh, when I should've known that
I'd be running back to you
Why was I just too blind to tell?
And now you're out with someone else
Oh, darling, I should've known that
I'd be running back to you
[Post-Chorus: Nico Santos]
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back to you
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back, oh-oh, running back to
Running back to you
Running back to you

[Chorus: Nico Santos]
Why did I keep lying to myself
When I was chasing someone else?
Oh, when I should've known that
I'd be running back to you
Why did I keep lying to myself
When I was chasing someone else?
Oh, when I should've known that
I'd be running back to you
Why was I just too blind to tell?
And now you're out with someone else
Oh, darling, I should've known that
I'd be running back to you

[Post-Chorus: Nico Santos]
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back to you
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back to, running back, oh-oh
Running back, oh-oh
I should've known that
I'd be running back to you
Running back to you
