Jason Derulo
Oh
Ooh

[Verse 1]
Bust it open for a gift
I put diamonds on your wrist
I can't buy your lovin'
It's never enough
I took that girl on a trip
'Cause we was arguin'
Ever since we stopped touchin'
We're not in touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
But we could work this like a nine-to-five (Woah-oh)
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change
But every war ends the same

[Chorus]
Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh
Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh

I solve my problems with a check
Now I'm payin' for it
You wanted nothin', uh
Nothin' but love
I can't lie, I'm a mess
I'm too jealous, yes
It's so hard to trust you
When I don't trust myself

[Pre-Chorus]
I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
But we could work this like a nine-to-five (Oh-woah)
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change
But every war ends the same

[Chorus]
Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh
Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh
[Bridge]
And my people say
(Oh) Oh-woah (Oh)
Let's just try some lovin', babe
'Cause shawty, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
I know money can't buy, buy, buy your love
I guess I didn't try, try hard enough
Girl, we could work it like a nine-to-five-five-five, woah-oh, baby
Mama told me stop playin', playin' all the games (Stop playin' the games)
Steady throwin' dollars expectin' change
But every war ends the same

[Chorus]
Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh, babe
Can we just
Make love
Not war?
Oh
Not war, babe
