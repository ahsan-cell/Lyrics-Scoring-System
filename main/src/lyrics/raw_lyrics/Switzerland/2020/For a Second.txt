[Verse 1]
Darling, pull me closer 'til I hear the beatin' heart I've been missin' (Uh, uh)
Since the night you took another I've been countin' down the hours, I'm driftin' (I'm driftin')
Some kinda tension runnin' through my mind
It's a feeling I don't want to fight (Fight)
Darling, pull me closer 'til I hear the beating heart I've been missin'

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three and I'm callin'
One, two, three and I'm yours

[Chorus]
Hold me just a little bit longer
I don't want the night to be over
Oh, I feel it's heaven
Oh-oh-oh, just for a second
If love is making me this drunk, yeah
Then I don't ever wanna be sober
Oh, I feel it's heaven
Oh-oh-oh, just for a second

[Post-Chorus]
A little, la-la-la, la-la-la
A little, la-la-la, la-la-la
Ooh, I feel it's heaven
Oh-oh-oh, just for a second

I was searchin' for that someone
I was lookin' for this love in the wrong place (Wrong place)
Then I stopped all the runnin'
And I didn't see you comin', was too late (Too late)
Got my attention in the fadin' light
And it's a feelin' I don't wanna fight (Fight)
No more searchin' for that someone
No more lookin' for that love 'cause I found you

[Pre-Chorus]
One, two, three and I'm calling
One, two, three and I'm yours

Hold me just a little bit longer
