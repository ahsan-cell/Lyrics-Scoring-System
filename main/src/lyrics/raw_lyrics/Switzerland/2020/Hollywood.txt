It's gonna happen tonight
I'm gonna make you feel right
'cause you're in Hollywood
Where the feels are good
No matter what you have done
Let's wait the morning to come
We're in Hollywood
Where your dreams come true

[Verse 1]
And there is something in me
I can't believe what I see
The dark is taking my mind
Don't wanna leave you behind
And there is something in me
I can't believe what I see
The dark is taking my mind
Don't wanna leave you behind

[Chorus]
It's gonna happen tonight
I'm gonna make you feel right
'cause you're in Hollywood
Where the feels are good
No matter what you have done
Let's wait the morning to come
We're in Hollywood
Where the feels are good

Maybe you're taking too wrong
Maybe you're getting too high
I only do what I should
But you're in Hollywood
Where streets are black and blue
And you can make it tonight
Having the time of your life
So what has happened to me?
So what has happened to me?
So what has happened to me?

[Chorus]
It's gonna happen tonight
I'm gonna make you feel right
'cause you're in Hollywood
Where the feels are good
No matter what you have done
Let's wait the morning to come
We're in Hollywood
Where your dreams come true

[Bridge]
And there is something in me
I can't believe what I see
The dark is taking my mind
Don't wanna leave you behind
And there is something in me
I can't believe what I see
The dark is taking my mind
Don't wanna leave you behind
[Outro]
Maybe you're taking too wrong
Maybe you're getting too high
I only do what I should
But you're in Hollywood
Where streets are black and blue
And you can make it tonight
Having the time of your life
So what has happened to me?
So what has happened to me?
So what has happened to me?
