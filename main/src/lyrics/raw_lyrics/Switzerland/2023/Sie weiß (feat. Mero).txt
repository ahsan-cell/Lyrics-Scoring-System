(Frio)
(Ey, Kyree)

[Verse 1: AYLIVA]
You stand in a different room (Yeah-yeah)
I don't know who you are anymore
You look for yourself in different women (Yeah)
Didn't you miss that
That she knows
That you're texting her right now
That you're staying with her today?
Dress code black, but you only wear bright colors
No one knows you like I do
You're living in a different world
Hoping that you'll like her now

[Pre-Chorus: AYLIVA]
Because you know
That she's crying because of you
'Cause you're not staying with her

[Chorus: AYLIVA]
(If I, if I, if I, if I) If I leave
Tell me, why is that a problem?
I missed you and you missed me, but I know
That you won't stay with me
Because you seem to be like me
You might also like[Verse 2: MERO]
You're in my head 24/7
I see your smile on my iPhone
Ey, you're the reason I'm awake (Heh)
No hotels, I wanna come home to you
No matter where you are, come back (Babe)
You're not easy, both of us aren't
So proud and stubborn like we are makes one sick, baby (Ah)
You're right, my phones are full of women, I also think (Heh)
That it's an addiction, you know I'm not stopping, ey
You and I, that was my intention
S-, somehow I want it, but it's not working

[Pre-Chorus: MERO]
And I know
That you're crying because of me
'Cause I'm not staying with you

[Chorus: MERO & AYLIVA, MERO]
(If I, if I, if I, if I) If I leave
Tell me, why is that a problem?
I missed you and you missed me, but I know
That you won't stay with me
Because you seem to be like me (Babygirl, babygirl, babygirl)
If I leave (I leave)
Tell me, why is that a problem? (Tell me)
I missed you and you missed me, but I know
That you won't stay with me
Because you seem to be like me
[Outro: MERO & AYLIVA]
Baby, I want you to stay
Baby, please, please stay
Baby, sta-sta-stay (Ah-ahh)
Sta-sta-stay (Ah-ahh)
Sta-sta-stay (Ah-ahh)
Baby, please sta-sta-stay (Ah-ahh)
Sta-sta-stay (Ah-ahh)
