Diving into real life
Tellin' me it's okay
But you're dyin' in the real life
Shit I don't wanna go there
'Cause that doesn't feel right
I'd rather hop up on a cold chair and fly to Ibiza

Can I be anymore clear?
Why would I wanna be there?
Would I wanna be there?
When I'm already here?
When I'm already here, okay
Can I be anymore clear?
Why would I wanna be there?
Would I wanna be there?
When I'm already here?
When I'm already here, okay

On a Friday night I'll mix it up
I'll mix it up
Like liquid cocaine (liquid cocaine)
On a Friday night I'll mix it up
I'll mix it up (I'll mix it up)
Like liquid cocaine (liquid cocaine)
Like liquid cocaine

And the stars come out
I just wonder how this all started out
When it seems too high
You just don't look down
They'll be callin' back when you're farther out

On a Friday night I'll mix it up
I'll mix it up
Like liquid cocaine (liquid cocaine)
On a Friday night I'll mix it up
I'll mix it up (I'll mix it up)
Like liquid cocaine (liquid cocaine)
