I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I try to push away the sorrow
But today, it's too late, I try tomorrow
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Verse 1]
I think that you were kinda mean (Kinda mean, kinda mean)
You just replaced me in the scene (In the scene, in the scene)
I thought that we were evergreen (Evergreen, evergreen)
Like a never-ending dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Never been on the TV
Scratched me off of your CV
Out of your mind, out of your mind
Never been so uneasy
Jealousy got me freaky
Out of my mind

[Chorus]
So I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I try to push away the sorrow
But today, it's too late, I try tomorrow
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

I'm losin' sleep all by myself
I'm wide awake, and I just wonder how
You put my heart back on the shelf (Back on the shelf)
Well, I'ma be a loner now

[Pre-Chorus]
Never been on the TV
Scratched me off of your CV
Out of your mind, out of your mind
Never been so uneasy
Jealousy got me freaky
Out of my mind

[Chorus]
So I get high like Colorado
We had it all, but what do I know?
I try to push away the sorrow
But today, it's too late, I try tomorrow
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)

[Bridge]
Drownin' in my sofa with my bloodshot red eyes (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Ridin' rollercoaster 'til I see the sunrise

[Chorus]
I get high like Colorado (I get high like, I get high)
We had it all, but what do I know?
I try to push away the sorrow (I get high like, I get high)
But today, it's too late, I try tomorrow
(Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah)
[Outro]
I get high like Colorado
Colorado (Yeah), Colorado (Yeah), Colorado
I get high like Colorado
Colorado (Yeah), Colorado (Yeah), Colorado
