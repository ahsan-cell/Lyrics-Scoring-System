So you think you know what bad is, bad is?
But, baby, I'm the baddest, baddest
Take you to another planet, planet
Higher than the sun
Say you got a couple habits, habits
Let me be the baddest, baddest
Drive you crazy 'cause I'm batshit, past it
But we could have some fun

[Verse]
Sorry if I break your heart
Sorry if I key your car, mm
Sorry if I leave a scar
Clawing at your back too hard, mm
Sorry if I blow your mind
Sorry, I could go all night, mm
Don't say I didn't warn ya
Boy, I warned ya, boy, I warned ya

[Pre-Chorus]
With my red dress
Matching with the lipstick
Make you go ballistic
See it in your eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
So you think you know what bad is, bad is?
But, baby, I'm the baddest, baddest
Take you to another planet, planet
Higher than the sun
Say you got a couple habits, habits
Let me be the baddest, baddest
Drive you crazy 'cause I'm batshit, past it
But we could have some fun

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be bad if you want it, bad if you want it bad
Bad if you want it, bad if you want it bad
Best that you never, best that you never had
So you think you know what bad is?

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
With my red dress
Matching with the lipstick
Make you go ballistic
See it in your eyes

[Chorus]
So you think you know what bad is, bad is?
But, baby, I'm the baddest, baddest
Take you to another planet, planet
Higher than the sun
Say you got a couple habits, habits
Let me be the baddest, baddest
Drive you crazy 'cause I'm batshit, past it
But we could have some fun
[Post-Chorus]
I'll be bad if you want it, bad if you want it bad
Bad if you want it, bad if you want it bad
Best that you never, best that you never had
So you think you know what bad is?
