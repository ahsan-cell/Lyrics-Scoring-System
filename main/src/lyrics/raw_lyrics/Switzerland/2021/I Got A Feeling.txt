I didn't break, I made it out
Those heavy things don't bring me down anymore
I found a way to make 'em count
'Cause I let the light in, yeah

[Chorus: Georgia Ku]
I got a feeling, I feel it, my head is at home
And when I'm breathing, I breathe in, I'm letting it go
No, no more sleeping, no reason to be in here alone
No more digging up the sad souls
I got a feeling, I feel it, my head is at home
And when I'm breathing, I breathe in, I'm letting it go
No, no more sleeping, no reason to be in here alone
No more digging up the sad souls

[Pre-Chorus: Georgia Ku]
I didn't break, I made it out
Those heavy things don't bring me down anymore
I found a way to make 'em come
'Cause I let the light in, yeah

[Chorus: Georgia Ku]
I got a feeling, I feel it, my head is at home
And when I'm breathing, I breathe in, I'm letting it go
No, no more sleeping, no reason to be in here alone
No more digging up the sad souls

[Chorus: Georgia Ku]
I got a feeling, I feel it, my head is at home
And when I'm breathing, I breathe in, I'm letting it go
No, no more sleeping, no reason to be in here alone
No more digging up the sad souls
