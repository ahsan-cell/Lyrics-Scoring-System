I replayed this moment for months
Alone in my head, waitin' for it to come
I wrote all your lines in the script in my mind
And I'd hoped that you'd follow it for once

[Pre-Chorus]
I imagined myself in satin, the room was platinum and gold
I'd dance and catch your eye, you'd be mesmerized, oh
We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so why
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night? No
Don't go yet

[Chorus]
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
What you leavin' for when my night is yours?
Just a littlе more, don't go yet
[Verse 2]
Baby, don't go yet
'Causе I wore this dress for a lil' drama
And I bet
I bet that you think that you know, but you don't, baby, come to mama
I get
I get what I want when I want and I get it how I wanna, wanna
And I want you, baby
Gotta get you, baby
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We'd find a corner there, your hands in my hair
Finally we're here, so why
Sayin' you got a flight, need an early night?
No, don't go yet

[Chorus]
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
What you leavin' for when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet

[Post-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet
Oye, don't go yet, don't go yet

Just a little more
What you leavin' for when my night is yours? Yours, yours
What you leavin' for when my night is yours?
Just a little more, don't go yet50
