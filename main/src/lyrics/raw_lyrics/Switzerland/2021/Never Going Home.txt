We're only human (I can feel it)
Music (Got me heated)
Yeah, let's repeat it (Can you feel it?)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna ride, come ride with me
Take me by the hand, feel the chemistry
Losing track of time in the ecstasy
It's getting out of hand, it's just you and me

[Chorus]
And we are never goin' home (Oh-woah, oh-woah)
Let's go dancin' 'til the mornin' (Oh-woah, oh-woah)
And we are never goin home (Oh-woah, oh-woah)
Let's go dancin' 'til the mornin'

[Verse]
Music (We can do it)
We're only human (I can feel it)

Yeah, let's repeat it (Can you feel it?)

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanna fly, come fly with me
We'll go anywhere that you wanna be
If you're feeling down, here's the remedy
Losing track of time, it's just you and me

I can feel it
