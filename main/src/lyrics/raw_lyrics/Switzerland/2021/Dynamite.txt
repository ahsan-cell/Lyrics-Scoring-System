Would you, would you love me, would you hold me
If I told you that it hurts?
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me?
So explosive

[Verse 1]
Boom, boom, boom, boy, you better be runnin', yeah
Boom, boom, boom, pull the trigger with no warnin', yeah
Too many people
Broke my heart and I got lonely
Like Lady Monroe
I just need someone to love me when

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm moody in the mornin'
When I'm lonely in the night
Someone to hold me when I'm fallin'
And to love me with no pride

[Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom
Would you, would you love me, would you hold me
If I told you that it hurts?
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me?
So explosive
Boy, you better run, run, call you like a siren
'Cause I got you under my spell
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me?
So explosive (Like dynamite)

They call me crazy
'Cause I run my mouth like Slim Shady

I just need someone to love me when

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm moody in the mornin'
When I'm lonely in the night
Someone to hold me when I'm fallin'
And to love me with no pride

[Chorus]
Boom, boom, boom
Would you, would you love me, would you hold me
If I told you that it hurts?
Would you, would you love me, would you touch me?
So explosive

Would you, would you love me, would you touch me?
So explosive (Like dynamite)
