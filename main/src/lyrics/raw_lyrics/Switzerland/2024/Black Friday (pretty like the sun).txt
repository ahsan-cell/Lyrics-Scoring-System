I wanna go party, I wanna have fun
Wanna be happy, could you show me how it's done?
You look so pretty, pretty like the sun
I could watch forever while you shine on everyone

[Chorus: Tom Odell]
I wanna go party, I wanna have fun
Wanna be happy, could you show me how it's done?
You look so pretty, pretty like the sun
I could watch forever while you shine on everyone
I wanna go party, I wanna have fun
Wanna be happy, could you show me how it's done?
You look so pretty, pretty like the sun
I could watch forever while you shine on everyone

[Post-Chorus: Tom Odell]
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be your friend
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be like the sun
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be your friend
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be like the sun
(I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be your friend)
(I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be like the sun)

[Verse: Tom Odell]
I want a better body, I want better skin
I wanna be perfect like all your other friends
You look so pretty, pretty like the wind
Every time you touch me, I feel adrenaline
You might also like[Chorus: Tom Odell]
I wanna go party, I wanna have fun
Wanna be happy, could you show me how it's done?
You look so pretty, pretty like the sun
I could watch forever while you shine on everyone

[Post-Chorus: Tom Odell]
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be your friend
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be like the sun
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be your friend
I wanna be happy 'cause I wanna be like the sun
