Bro got the light with dark
Dark with light now
(She wanna slide on me)
Came wid a black ting left with a white one
(She wanna slide on me)
Jump on the stage and I shell that uh
(She wanna slide on me)
What you know ‘bout that
You don’t know ‘bout that now
(She wanna slide on)

[Chorus 2]: Remy
Bro got the light with dark
Dark with light now
(She wanna slide on me)
Came wid a light ting left with an Asian
(She wanna slide on me)
Jump on the stage and I shell that easy
(She wanna slide on me)
What you know ‘bout that
You don’t know ‘bout that bro
(She wanna slide on)

[Verse 1]: Remy
The plans untold 
I stay silеnt ’til it all unfolds
She gave me thе shoulder responded so cold 
Cah I was outside just putting in work 
While you was down rotting in mould 
This ain’t a caption ain’t for the gram 
We’re down to blow with an instant plan 
In the AM we go to ‘Dam 
In the PM we out in France 
I had a chance trap or my raps
Could’ve been one or two 
Either way I would’ve been on the maps
Disliked but i’m hot or cold no taps 
Never mind me since 
019 I’ve been taking laps on every track

What you know ‘bout that
You don’t know ‘bout that now
(She wanna slide on)

[Chorus 2]: Remy
Bro got the light with dark
Dark with light now

You don’t know ‘bout that bro
(She wanna slide on)

[Verse 2]: Tm
I get the cash in hand
Cash them bands
Wrapped in elastic
She don’t want nuttin’ but plastic
Surgery
Cutting these lines from practice
You know that it’s suttin when you roll wid it
Can’t fold it
Next day you holding it
And she’s think her man is crazy
You don’t know crazy
S goes crazy
Take this back
Bring me some Yeezy’s
That’s what I feel like
You better catch my flick when I run with bag
And spike no cactus
Told Sorin just film this
We make a movie
That they gon steal no jack in
I’m on the stage
No kidding
Run this hook back again man I’m livid
[Chorus 1]: Tm + vi0let
Bro got the light with dark

What you know ‘bout that
You don’t know ‘bout that now
(She wanna slide on)

[Chorus 2]: Remy + vi0let
Bro got the light with dark

Jump on the stage and I shell that easy

What you know ‘bout that
You don’t know ‘bout that bro
(She wanna slide on)
