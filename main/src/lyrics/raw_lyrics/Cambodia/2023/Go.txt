Can't believe she mine, when I didn't know her still had her on my mind, lord I I, use to fantasize, now I gotta analyze, but you wanted me I didn't know you put a plan aside

You added me on Facebook, it ain't took, a long time to talk I wrote you saying hey look...I don't think I know you, wrote back & forth then I tried ignore you, huh

Every time I tried to end it, she would write back man the girl was persistent, then she broke down and told my baby boy listen, I been doing research on you like forensics

Whoa...well that's different

Skipped all the bull Scottie Pippen, I ain't never never had a girlfriend should I mention, feining for some love and your words got me itching

Back track that's my home girl Nikki...we go back like 4 flats on cat lack, man I'm talking Spider-Man and Barbie back packs then I got ghost like the logo on Snapchat

What you mean you don't think you did enough crying, then she told me that a close cousin just died...so I told her come over, couple hours later she was crying on my shoulder

Consoling her through her situation, I forgot about the problems I was facing, I should've faced it, cause if it didn't make sense back then right now boy it make sense
