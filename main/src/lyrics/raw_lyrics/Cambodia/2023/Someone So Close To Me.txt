[VERSE]
Sick, twisted, and demented
That's the labels they give
For all us god forsaken bastards
And the foster home kids
No place to call home
No real reason to live
Slow motion, dope smoking
Hoping something will give
Had dinner every night?
I bet it was nice
I was in the dark, no lights
Shaking bottles at night
I walk a tightrope, eyes closed
Edge of a knife
And I'm so goddamn close to end up taking my life
You might also like{VERSE]
Don't come gunning for my squad yo they're already dead
If not they're just slump from the pills they've been fed
Hanging out in Alabama just smoking the meth
And no man will ever kill me
Except for myself

[VERSE]
Sick, twisted, and demented
That's the labels they give
For all us god forsaken bastards
And the foster home kids
No place to call home
No real reason to live
Slow motion, dope smoking
Hoping something will give
Got a warm bed to sleep?
Yo I bet that shit's nice
No heat, ice cold
Till I spark up the pipe
No home, all alone
Introduce wrist to knife
And I'm so goddamn close to end up taking my life
