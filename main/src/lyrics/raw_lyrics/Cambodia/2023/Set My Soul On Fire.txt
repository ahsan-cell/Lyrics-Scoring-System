Verse 1: Malcom Mufunde
Uh
I'm the reason creation took longer than needed
You need a mobile crane to handle my business
I discoverеd the third law of motion had a loophole
And managed to pull off еverything that I pushed for
There's a point in my throwaway lines
I'm just throwing free lines from the free throw line
I'm from an era where dope emceeing was not an error
And we used to take care of these bars like a jailer
This is the God flow, I feel like Poseidon
I done crossed every line, including the horizon
I'm grateful my mama was fruitful in labor
Coz now she gets to marvel at the fruits of her labor
I was going apeshit before the Carters hit the Louvre
My only hypothesis is I've nothing to prove
Y'all silly, trynna go face to face with a hydra
Or go toe-to-toe with a spider
Got the heart of a lion; xenotransplantation
I put up numbers like superscripts in mathematics
And my bars trigger endothermic reactions
Coz I got hot lines; emergency communication
And the build-up is always to a punchline you can marvel
Y'all build up to nothing like the tower of Babel
Never thought I'd have an audience
Making music was a stretch for me like an accordion
They thought I would perish during hip-hop's calamity
But instead I rose over disaster like Cassidy
Rose so high, I now rap from the stratus
You can find my whole art in heaven; The Lord's Prayer
Time for the scale to get it straight
That like Biggie and Pun, I'm a hip-hop heavyweight
In a room with Nadia Nakai naked and Nicki Minaj humping
I'll remain the main attraction
Should I humble them or just murder your favorites?
The dichotomy of bringing down to earth or sending to heaven
It's a death race trynna go against Mufunde
See, speed kills and I'm as quick as a bullet
I'll bury one into you and then bury you too
Shatter the faces of these Who's Whos, you'll wonder who's who?
But I'm just here for hip-hop
So let me stick to my guns like Miles in Guns Akimbo
You might also likeBridge: Malcom Mufunde
Who should I kill next? Who knows, nigga?
I'm the GOAT and I'm sick; zoonose, nigga
Dubs only, my win record like ZANU
A trillion dollars on my head is downplaying my value
The most important rapper in my era
I'm instrumental; without me, this game is a cappella
I'd to change my stage name so your fear could die
Coz only schizophrenia could mess with Tha M.I.N.D

Hook: TiNaYe
Ndichatora mukombe, ndichatora mukombe
Hunting the glory, and writing my story
Ndichatora mukombe, ndichatora mukombe
Hunting the glory, and writing my story

Verse 2: Malcom Mufunde
I'm too real; the second realest nigga is my clone
Could use calcium in my diet; I'm sick to the bone
And the throne is now familiar with my fart
A stethoscope will tell you I got hip-hop in my blood
I set the bar so high even Mugeyi couldn't miss
And these raps like a bad bitch, they was meant for the streets
Rags to riches but I'm still in my rag phase
But one day I'll be drowning in ice like the revenant
They say God doesn't approve of my boastful language
Well, to conquer Jericho, I gotta blow my own trumpet
Pointing a silencer at every loudmouth
Coz I'm getting sick of this beef; anthrax
My lines ahead of time; they confuse the timeline
And I flow with energy like a pipeline
Yet I'm underpaid, I relate with the other gender
Though I put in more work than immigrant labor
Guess them ups and downs make us stronger like pushups
I got dreams and goals too fantastic for a Puskas
I'm from where the lowlives get to live higher
Where we smoke grass like veld fires
My bros cooked bricks before Lafarge had a building
And moved kilos for miles; F the metric system
Wack 100- I'm in control of the game now
Was eating beats raw, they got mustard on them now
You know what time it is, these are timeless
Bars
My music is making rounds like Remington Arms
This record is more amazing than any in the Guinness Book
I told Tinaye we're gon have the game shook
Niggas act like we're integrated, we're in another class
Y'all don't even need calculus to differentiate us
I still beat the rap after I murder a rap beat
Still complex while I stick to the basics
No mechanical advantage; I'm just loaded with effort, man
Wu Tang forever but I use a different method, man
I'm on fire, my complexion is the testimony
So don't you poke me with this beef shit like pepperoni
No kidding, it's like I got protection
I bare my soul in the booth like a Catholic confession
I'm honestly not here for the money
If I go commercial, I'll sell more platinum than Zvishavane
Bridge: Malcom Mufunde
Who should I kill next? Who knows, nigga?
I'm the GOAT and I'm sick; zoonose, nigga
Dubs only, my win record like ZANU
A trillion dollars on my head is downplaying my value
The most important rapper in my era
I'm instrumental; without me, this game is a cappella
I'd to change my stage name so your fear could die
Coz only schizophrenia could mess with Tha M.I.N.D

Outro: TheUltraPoet
The simplest thing is not always the easiest
In a world of filters, Botox and autotune
Being basic is arguably the hardest thing you can be
So when I say I'm an underdog, I'm not feeling bad about myself
I'm celebrating the fact that I found comfort in who I am
That I would choose understanding over being outstanding
Never giving in to the limits of my gifts
Breaking the glass ceiling
Aching is a luxurious feeling
Working vigorously is my calling
Having sleepless nights is part of my being
I have something to say
I know what I bring to the table
How they take it is how they take it
"Fake it till you make it"
Is a ticket to going how you came
When you kick the bucket
Took the Ls for ladders
And transcended to a higher plane
That has always been the plan
Getting the bag and edifying the clan
If they don't give me my bouquet
Even if I don't get the bookings
Knowing that I tried is a win in my book
