Oh, yeah
Ah

[Verse 1]
I never felt this way before
The ceiling's looking like the floor
Don't know which way is up anymore
And you, baby, it's because of you
Boy, I'm so in love, it's true
You got me thinking

[Chorus]
Just for a moment, I wanna be yours
The one that you're down for, down for
Don't you wanna be mine? Just for a moment
Baby, just hold me, hold me

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Forever, baby, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Whatever it takes, I'll find a way for you to be mine

[Verse 2]
My heart has never felt so free
Its surfaced on the love in me
I'm falling off the edge for the first time
I'm never gonna hit the ground
Gravity can't touch me now
And you got me thinking
You might also like[Chorus]
Just for a moment, I wanna be yours
The one that you're down for, down for
Don't you wanna be mine? Just for a moment
Baby, just hold me, hold me

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Forever, baby, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Whatever it takes, I'll find a way for you to be mine

[Bridge]
You wanna be mine
You wanna be mine

[Chorus]
Just for a moment, I wanna be yours
The one that you're down for, down for
Don't you wanna be mine? Just for a moment
Baby, just hold me, hold me

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Forever, baby, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Whatever it takes, I'll find a way for you to be mine
Mine, mine, mine, mine
Forever, baby, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
Don't you wanna be mine, mine, mine, mine, mine?
Whatever it takes, I'll find a way for you to be mine
