This kind of love, is not the love
The stories told you all about (Yeah, yeah)
This kind of love, is not the love
That's gonna make your parents proud
But it's the love, that's in our blood
And it's the only thing we want

[Post-Chorus: Angie with Maci]
This kind of love
This kind of love

[Verse 1: Maci]
Let's talk about love
Let's talk about all the things we don't say
Hard conversations, kinda dangerous
Here we go

[Verse 2: Maci]
Let's talk about us
Let's talk about all the things in our way
And let them say that it's outrageous
That we don't

[Pre-Chorus: Luke]
Follow the rules, color the lines
Say that it's cool, say that it's fine
This land is yours, this land is mine
We can't be denied
