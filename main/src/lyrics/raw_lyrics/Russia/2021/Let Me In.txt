When you put your lips on mine
You make me wanna feel alive
It’s gonna be a crazy night
I can feel your body shake
I promise that your heart won’t break
Cause loving you ain’t no mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Frozen
Hands around your body
Got you moaning again
Sorry
You’re not coming home tomorrow morning
Oh no

[Chorus]
Baby, just let me in
Trust me it’s not a sin
Wrap your arms around my neck
Oh, baby, don’t rush
Going until sunrise
Ain’t gotta ask me twice
I would run a thousand miles to do it
I would die to do it again
Again
Again
I would die to do it again

Lingerie on the floor
Saying that you want some more
It’s something that I can’t ignore
You ain’t never running low
You never seem to let me go
Oh baby you’re in control, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Frozen
Hands around your body
Got you moaning again
Sorry
You’re not coming home tomorrow morning
Oh no

[Chorus]
Baby, just let me in
Trust me it’s not a sin
Wrap your arms around my neck
Oh, baby, don’t rush
Going until sunrise
Ain’t gotta ask me twice
I would run a thousand miles to do it
I would die to do it again
Again
Again
I would die to
[Outro]
Baby, just let me in
Trust me it’s not a sin
Wrap your arms around my neck
Oh, baby, don’t rush
Going until sunrise
Ain’t gotta ask me twice
I would run a thousand miles to do it
I would die to do it
