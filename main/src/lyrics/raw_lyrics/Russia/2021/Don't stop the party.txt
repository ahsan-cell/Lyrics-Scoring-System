I don't need no men to tell me how to party
Running my own house
I'm tough and acting hardy
Yes, I'm my own boss
Make the calls and I call the shots
So really I don't need no m–∞n to tell me how to party

[Pre-Chorus:]
Ring-ring, call the shots
Make it bling-a-bling
Real boss attitude
Recognize the queen
Yikes, got my heels and my head up high
You can't touch my crown
I'm on the spotlight
Shake it up
You weak and I'm rocking
Step it up
I'm moving, you stoppin
I'm fly
Too lit, you can't touch it (touch it)

[Chorus:]
Don't stop the party
(All night with shake)
Don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
Don't stop the party

You acting tough, you onto nothing
Whip up the thing cuz you're bluffing
Me the bad gyal, dollar bills in my pockets
Body dripping that juice like a faucet, oh
I make my own rules
Call the shots, make them money move
So really I don't need a man to tell me how to party

[Pre-Chorus:]
Ring-ring, call the shots
Make it bling-a-bling
Real boss attitude
Recognize the queen
Yikes, got my heels and my head up high
You can't touch my crown
I'm on the spot light
Shake it up
You weak and I'm rocking
Step it up
I'm moving, you stoppin
I'm fly
Too lit, you can't touch it (touch it)

[Chorus:]
Don't stop the party
(All night with shake)
Don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
[Bridge:]
I iced up both my wrists
Wish you feel this
Can you tell the pricing?
I'm platinum
If I like it I keep
When I talk, they're all listening
Eyes up, I'm my own driver
I'm a bad bitch and my own provider
So no, you can't stop this
(Please don't stop the party)

[Chorus:]
Don't stop the party
(All night with shake)
Don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
Don't stop the party
