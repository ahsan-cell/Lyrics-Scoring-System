I don't wanna waste my time with you (hey)
One day you're adamant
The next day you're out of it
There's really nothing else that I can do (hey)
Don't wanna juxtapose
That's not how this should go

[Pre-Chorus]
Are ya green or are you red
You alive or are you dead to me
It's hard to see (ya ya ya)
Are you lost or are you found
Are you in or are you out of reach

[Chorus]
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
You might also like
[Verse 2]
Why you gotta be so puzzling (hey)
I feel your hands on me
Next day ya try to leave
Yeah It's like we’re making make believe (yeah)
Between the lines all day
I’ll blur them anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
Are ya green or are you red
You alive or are you dead to me
It's hard to see (ya ya ya)
Are you lost or are you found
Are you in or are you out of reach

[Chorus]
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals

[Verse 3]
Do you believe the things you say
Or make it up along the way
I can't, can't understand
I'm rarely at a loss of words
But when we talk it makes it worse for me

[Chorus]
'Cuz I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh
I cannot read you
You're giving mixed signals
Giving mixed signals
Giving mixed signals
