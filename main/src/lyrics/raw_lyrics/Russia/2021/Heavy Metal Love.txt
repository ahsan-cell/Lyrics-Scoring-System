Cigarette boy, I left my heart in your ashtray
Sound of your voice, a lullaby made of bad days
You fill that void, but what's the point?
'Cause you're movin' on to the next stage
My lip in your teeth, roses in my glasses
We break the AC when we make out to Black Sabbath
You fill that void, but what's the point?
Guess we're both a little bit damaged

[Chorus: Nina Chuba]
I want your heavy metal love
I just can't, just can't get enough
So gimme, gimme all you got
I want your heavy metal love
I want your heavy metal love (La, la, la-la)
I just can't, just can't get enough (Na, na, na-na)
So gimme, gimme all you got (Break my heart)
I want your heavy metal love (La, la, la-la)

[Verse 2: Nina Chuba]
Oh, babe, I see you
Carry all of that baggage, shit you never unpack
I'm holdin' on to those habits, won't you hold me instead?
So cynical, but typical
How I'm trapped in all of that madness
You might also like[Bridge: Nina Chuba]
When the smoke clears in the night
(Like oh my god, like oh my, oh my god)
It's so cold here, tell me why
(Like oh my god, like oh my, oh my god)

[Chorus: Nina Chuba]
I want your heavy metal love
I just can't, just can't get enough
So gimme, gimme all you got
I want your heavy metal love
I want your heavy metal love (La, la, la-la)
I just can't, just can't get enough (Na, na, na-na)
So gimme, gimme all you got (Break my heart)
I want your heavy metal love (La, la, la-la)
