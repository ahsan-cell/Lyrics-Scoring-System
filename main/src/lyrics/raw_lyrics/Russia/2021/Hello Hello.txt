Hello hello

[Verse 1: INNA]
Chest to chest, you and me exposed
Deeper than you could ever know
I guess I'm not what you prefer
Jealous, don't know what you see in her

[Chorus: INNA]
Hello hello, can't you see that
I'm the one you should be chasing?
I'm the one you should be thinking of
Hello hello, can't you see
I love you right? I'll treat you good
I'll do you like nobody else does

[Chorus: Melon]
Hello hello, can't you see that
I'm the one you should be chasing?
I'm the one you should be thinking of
Hello hello, can't you see
I love you right? I'll trеat you good
I'll do you like nobody else doеs

[Post-Chorus: INNA]
Nobody else does
Hello hello

I feel what you don't feel for me
Hearts beating, but they never meet
Tell me, are you crazy? Are you blind?
It’s your loss but I'm losing my mind

[Chorus: INNA]
Hello hello, can't you see that
I'm the one you should be chasing?
I'm the one you should be thinking of
Hello hello, can't you see
I love you right? I'll treat you good
I'll do you like nobody else does

[Chorus: Melon]
Hello hello, can't you see that
I'm the one you should be chasing?
I'm the one you should be thinking of
Hello hello, can't you see
I love you right? I'll treat you good
I'll do you like nobody else does

[Bridge: INNA]
Hello hello, hello hello
Hello hello, hello hello
Hello hello, can't you see
I love you right? I'll treat you good
I'll do you like nobody else does
[Chorus: Melon]
Hello hello, can't you see that
I'm the one you should be chasing?
I'm the one you should be thinking of
Hello hello, can't you see
I love you right? I'll treat you good
I'll do you like nobody else does

[Outro: INNA]
Hello hello
