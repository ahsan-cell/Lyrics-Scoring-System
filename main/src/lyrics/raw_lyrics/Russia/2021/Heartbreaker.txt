If you give me love
I'll never take it
Cause everybody
Knows you're a heartbreaker
Never tell me
Would you be my baby
Cause everybody
Knows you're a heartbreaker

[Verse]
Is it love I can tell
When the feeling's comin' through my veins
Is it love or spell put on me
When you take my hands, no

[Pre-Chorus]
If you give me love
I'll never take it
Cause еverybody
Knows you're a heartbrеaker

[Chorus]
If you give me love
I'll never take it
Cause everybody
Knows you're a heartbreaker
Never tell me
Would you be my baby
Cause everybody
Knows you're a heartbreaker

Echo in the distance
I want you to listen
Like my heart is beating
When I get this feeling
When I get this feeling
(I'll never take it)
(Cause everybody knows you're a heartbreaker)

[Chorus]
If you give me love
I'll never take it
Cause everybody knows you're a heartbreaker
Never tell me
Would you be my baby
Cause everybody knows you're a heartbreaker
