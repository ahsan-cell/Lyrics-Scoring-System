Kissed a lot of girls, even kissed a boy
Must have been that sweet summer wine
I wanted to be free, learning how to breathe
But loneliness came time after time

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell did we keep dreaming?
When I did you so wrong?
But the memories still creeping in your head

[Chorus]
I don't know why, I don't know why
You put your heart back on the line
I don't how, I don't how
Ooh, the summer really hurt us, God damn (God damn 'cause)

[Verse 2]
Teardrops in your eyes when I told you lies
Selfish when I broke us apart
Saw еverything in blue and said some things 'bout you
But nonе of it was true, my love

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell did we keep dreaming?
When I did you so wrong?
But the memories still creepin' in your head
You might also like[Chorus]
I don't know why, I don't know why
You put your heart back on the line
I don't know how, I don't know how
Ooh, the summer really hurt us, God damn
I don't know why, I don't know why
You put your heart out every time (You put your heart out everytime)
I don't know how, I don't know how
Ooh, the summer really hurt us so bad (So bad 'cause)

[Post-Chorus]
Lost it in June, fucked up in July
Missed you in August, too
Lost it in June, fucked up in July
Missed you in August, too

[Bridge]
The summer really hurt us
I wanted to be perfect, God damn
The summer really hurt us
I wanted to be perfect so bad

[Chorus]
I don't know why, I don't know why
You put your heart back on the line
I don't know how, I don't know how
Ooh, the summer really hurt us, God damn
I don't know why, I don't know why
You put your heart out every time (You put your heart out everytime)
I don't know how, I don't know how (I don't how, I don't how)
Ooh, the summer really hurt us, God damn2
