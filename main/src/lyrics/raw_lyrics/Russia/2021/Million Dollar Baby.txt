(She's a miracle)
(She’s a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh)

[Verse 1]
Diamonds
She turns tears to diamonds, woah
Tryin'
To find that silver linin', woah

[Pre-Chorus]
And once in a while, I’ll go walkin' in the twilight
Countin' down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hidin' in the shadows
Prayin' that she'll break free

[Chorus]
In the dark of the night, she got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby, nobody can explain it
She’s a miracle
She’s a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh
She broke out of her chains, turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby, she bound to drive me crazy
She’s a miracle
She's a miraclе, oh, oh, oh, ooh

Heart broke, oh
You can't keep her down though, oh (Ah, ah, ah)
Icе-cold, oh
She's comin’ back to life though, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And once in a while, I'll go walkin' in the twilight
Countin' down to midnight
Close my eyes and wait for her to shine
I'm hidin' in the shadows
Prayin' that she'll break free

[Chorus]
In the dark of the night, she got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby, nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh
She broke out of her chains, turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby, she bound to drive me crazy
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh

[Chorus]
In the dark of the night, she got danger on her mind
She's a million dollar baby, nobody can explain it
She's a miracle
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh (She's a miracle)
She broke out of her chains, turned the fire into rain
She's a million dollar baby, she bound to drive me crazy
She's a miracle (She's a miracle, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
She's a miracle, oh, oh, oh, ooh
