[Verse 1: Chillinit]
Meet me in a backstreet boy
Nah, don't sing, don't dance, but the boys got bands like a backstreet boy
I don't got time for the backseat noise
I was shotgun riding with Izzy on repeat
From the city where the weed be
So damn strong got the walls start looking all 3D
I just smoked on a freebie
To count the money when the jacks try see me
I just want peace g
In a penthouse laid low, laid back trynna feel that sea breeze
I got the seaweed
Fuck you know bout the G steeze, none
Blow you a kiss like chasey
Bad little bitch, Malibu like stacey
Heart like Kevin but I feel all Spacey
So don't chat man just like Tracy I Chapman lately

[Verse 2: Eyez]
Cats to walk on me like a doormat
Don't know why he thought that
Don't know why he thought he could talk smack
Don't know why he thought I don't know where he lives but Iâ€™m right where his doors at
Kick it so hard that the walls in the hallway fall back
Run up in a place, me and snort rat
Run up in the place, where the jaws get stored at
New block came from Kazakhstan but it's not Borat
You think you can buff corn at me
? You could buff corn at
Mate ye I dare that
Still hit the block in my air max
And I got weed, I'll share that

Come together and send like infrared, oi
Guess again who's king of the west
Gimme a second on a rhythm and I spit 'em again
Dickhead, miss me with an indirect
Terrible MCs get ripped to shreds
Prove a point with this pen and page
Paint a picture, this pile's poppin'
Post a pic see your pockets piling
But you pontious pilot
Your pro's are profit

Peek-a-boo, we approach a problem, took a pikachu
But you ain't got to be, oh cmon you more Pocahontas

Dot, dot, dare in the sad, little bag broke so a little Dan car it won't fit in
Nowadays everyone like, shit, nowdays everyone snitchin

Don't talk shit car man I might spray that
Just got a batch of gaga, might whip that shit like a maybach

[?]
Uh, little man, that's a man bag on your hip
That's not a bag on your wrist
Still kicking ball, got a bag of assists
When I rap it's a gift, you should turn man to a GIF
And caption it this:
Left to the young and the handsome are rich when they're back in this bitch
Swear down on the man in the myth
Man, I roll joints like ankle and wrist
Have a sample of this
Nobody knows me to ? for this
Man talk shit, I ain't standing for it
Come for the queens, said that's a stamp for a brit
Fam you're a prick
Middle seat man in the back of the whip
Minus to me your a gram to a brit
Hold shit down man I anchor the ship
Kam dog know how to handle my shit

[Verse 11: Scotty Minister]
Sharpest tool in the box, bench mark, more like the sharpening block
Sharpest fool in the flock, flex in the hench bars, still heart in the lock
Don't park in my spot, might spark me off, and I'm gonna leave hear with your Bagari watch
Wall last round me half a oz, strike you down, send you off, half a box
A K the cost to be the boss, can't afford a war, bout to take a loss
Talk with 4 straws, place off, never get played on game lock
Jesus, peace, the new high score
I saw for the score, you all applaud
Of course I'm a torch an he dance to the floor
And I scorch and I blast, cars on all four

[Verse 12: Manga Saint Hilare]
Hell around me, heaven above me, and only my family love me, that's raw
Mad jack call like the family name, even my nan goes to get claw
Mad jack smile and my face in bread but man I got energies they can't connoisseur
Laugh for them tracks stealin my vibes
But I won over the teachers like claws
Don't know what them, they never over there
But I'm out here, I'm trynna get these bags for the bores
If you play this I don't do roll call, I'm tacking the post code to make man blow
A lot of emcee's dissappear a year, I guess they were never that skilled
I just work in pattern, I build
With no label manageable deal
