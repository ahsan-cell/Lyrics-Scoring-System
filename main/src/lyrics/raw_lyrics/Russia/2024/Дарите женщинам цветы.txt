Give flowers to women
Without a reason
After all, you don't need much
To be happy
Give flowers to women
Without a reason
After all, you don't need much
To be happy

[Verse 1]
I will give you lily of the valley
Lily of the valley from the heart
I give you lilies
Yellow, red, blue
I will give you daisies
And Aigulka and Natasha
I will give you all the flowers
You are forever in my heart

[Chorus]
Give flowers to women
Without a reason
After all, you don't need much
To be happy
Give flowers to women
Without a rеason
After all, you don't need much
To be happy

Give flowers to women
Without a reason
After all, you don't need much (you don't need much)
To be happy
