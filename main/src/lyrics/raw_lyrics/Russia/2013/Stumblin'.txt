Yeah

[Verse 1]
I hope you're ready
For the best night of your life
I got a table, grab a cup
Drink it up till you don't know left from right

[Refrain]
There's no other way to do it, let's go HAM
And we gonna do it like we're stupid, going to the AM
Tell the cups don't stop the party like we're VIP
If you're lucky you might end up in my BED

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohhh, I'm feeling so intensified
Ohh, I hope this feeling last for night

[Chorus]
This liquor got me stumblin and stumblin in here
Bottles keep on tumblin and tumlin in here
DJ got a rumbling and rumbling in here
Everybody stumblin, everybody stumblin
Ohh, this liquor got me stumblin and stumblin in here
Ohh, everybody stumblin, everybody stumblin
You might also like[Verse 2]
I know you're thirsty
We're bout to take another round
Jump on the floor, break it sweat
Watch your step before your body hit the ground

[Refrain]
There's no other way to do it, let's go HAM
And we gonna do it like we're stupid, going to the AM
Tell the cups don't stop the party like we're VIP
If you're lucky you might end up in my BED

[Pre-Chorus]
Ohhh, I'm feeling so intensified
Ohh, I hope this feeling last for night

[Chorus]
This liquor got me stumblin and stumblin in here
Bottles keep on tumblin and tumlin in here
DJ got a rumbling and rumbling in here
Everybody stumblin, everybody stumblin
Ohh, this liquor got me stumblin and stumblin in here
Ohh, everybody stumblin, everybody stumblin
