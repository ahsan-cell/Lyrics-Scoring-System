Faded man. Blue dream. Veto Mega

Dead Hooker Rap, real I'm doing 'em hard
Dustwitch proved that I got two in the car
Proof that I'm odd, shoot guns in the street at the stars
Shoot at the stars
Dust pockets deep, juice at the bar
Gruesome with bars
Losing it, loosening yarn
My crew underground from the nukes and the narcs
I survived and took their blood to shoot at the arm
Incinerate me, put me in a cannon and shoot me to Mars
I'm not an addict, I shoot for the charge
Kids are biters they chew like a gar
I jump off the roof, you're in the booth like you're hard
Easy, crack with balloons boost by a mark
Let the dope usage crack this shit
It's dope music, speedball and overdose to it
If I can't clip a life let the coke do it
I push the dope spike into my arm til the bone bruises
I'm tripping oddly, in the living room with brother dad and mommy
Watching a watery liquid water worm grow from my chest like Donny
Smashing body clones, build like HH Homes
Let gallons of rubbing alcohol flow
I'll point like Mizrachi scope
They'll have to lock me old
First one was sloppy, sweating Bianchi
Trying to copy those
I'm in your veins, I'm pocket smoke
Pop a dose, watch him take the Koolaid from the toxin bowl

I'm Artemis with poisoned arrows; my aura casts shadows in a vacuum
Blaze like the second star, wreck like a typhoon
I ate god’s flesh and punch holes into space from a qong-bu stance
High in my hourglass house, watching time contract and expand
I’m like my man's Sicilian gran; see the future from the gut
Read between the twisted lines in the entrails, squeeze the lungs
When I exhale, chasing dreams of giant cacti heads until I’m weary
Drop bitters, pupils tuned in, Timothy Leary
Deaf to health warnings, early bird on vodka mornings
Scheming on tequila worms at sunrise when the night owl starts yawning
Cursed to surf these desert-scapes with a bag of fear and loathing
Elevated and super holy like ragged jeans, torn clothing
On that peace-pipe shit, I’ll stay alight like mass candles
Counting five trillion digits of pi backwards
On blue stems and dancing druid organisms – lunar pagan rituals
Circling gateways tracing ancient sacred algorithms
Hover thoughts, don't desert ship, I’ll roam the abyss
Pushed by solar winds, cruise the river Styx on VetoMegastrings
Cosmic navigator slash blunt fiend
Volcanic spit burns like roast masters, thoughts paint the void's canvas
Implode like supernovas when I’m blasted, if you’re fast enough
Might see some tracers; catch a couple flows like aqua ducts

[Puppet The Grimey]
Real violence, sneak inside load the clip with pill vials
In a piece of tin foil then clamps to share piles with
I don't mind if she dies, she's mine to become fine with it
Alright she dips and hides I find her I'm still following
Suicide, squeeze the trigger lose my mind
It's been 8 hours lose my iris, pin holes it's 'bout that time again
I need at least 3 when I rise, 6 more just to wind
Burn bridges get home sniff coke with my moms
Nose black, clothes ashy, soot stuck under my nails
My life entails lies while my arms looks like a bike trails
Fuck with this blonde, said she fed me what was stuffed in her palm
Drain her of funds, have fun, get 'em hooked and move on
If I'm social at a show then I'm spun
Told you I'm good, mainline, clothes soaking in blood
I'm the one that got you stuck after I sold you my subs
Stole from everyone I know and they still showing me love
I'm a creep, sunshine in my tongue
Perform with the gods on every drug known under the sun
Knotting out in the car, needle stuck in my arm
She suck up the blood, kiss me nose let it dry up her gauze

[Boxguts]

Off the hook like dinner with a hole in it
Look what's not on a chain now, anchor broke away from ship
Graze the cliffs, boats sinking in waves I spit
Spraying sick as liquid shit
Filleting scripts, listeners say they can taste the fish
Taking trips yo don't waste a hit
Dipped in a mermaid's lake and I ate the bitch
Pale chunks on my plate getting scaled and skinned
Flailing fins and entrails in bins
Detail the phlegm with gems to derail in trails of chems
Tales that drench, it's raining razor blades and pins
Run outside and try not to feel that pain or flinch
Faces minced, an alien rinse
Bound to drain the Earth of sapiens since first slurping from craniums
[ID]

I can't explain the damage done to my brain
Wondering what happened to family fun with the games
Addiction must of did it, I planned it, nothing will change
Picture my family tree standing under the rain
Candy cane hands from the branches under my name
Heroin for Christmas, Santa comes with a bang
Shining like Doc, damn these colorful dreams
Take a shot but be patient, don't panic cause of your aim
You don't want to miss so find the right spot
Tie the knot, dry the rock and slam it up in your veins
The second coming of Charlie Sheen
Forcing Harley teens to withstand the suffer and pain
Got the bitch on all fours panting stuck to a chain
While I spoon feed her dog food, jam it under her fangs
I like my bitch branded, slutty and tamed
A real firecracker dancing under a flame
Came a long way from last in line
Starring at her ass behind a dozen others just for a chance to jump in the train
Gang banged til we left her bloody and crippled
The bitch blew 20 of my cousins and switched crews
Popped for five homies, sodomize holy shit
Baptize, dry your eyes only if I say do so
I will rape you slow, well not really
I'm just trying to make you know the level of the power I withhold
The power to control, just think about it with that powder in your nose
You don't want to see a seed get deflowered when it grows
Lighting up, wanna ??, how about it bros
I suppose now you know how it goes
When you fucking with a mothafucking creep, type to fuck you while you sleep
You wonder why I keep a couple bundles of the D
I have you slumbering for weeks, I'm just summing up the least
