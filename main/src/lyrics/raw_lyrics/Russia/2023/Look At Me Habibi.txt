Uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Left for a minute, I do not sweat it
Look at the cash I’m spending
Do-or-die goals, suicide doors
This uncut, no edit
I keep it ten toes, sandals
Been Dubai drippin’
So many goals
That’s that Lionel Messi
Yeah, let’s get it

[Chorus]
Wow, wow, look at me, habibi
Wow, wow, Dubai drip, let’s get it
Wow, wow, look at me, habibi
Dubai drip, let’s get it
Bags — expensive

[Verse]
Yeah
Don’t touch me, back it up, back it up, back it up, back it up (Woo)
We might have to bag it up, bag it up, bag it up, bag it up (Boom)
Alhamdulillah, look at the way I managed stack it up
M.J
Ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra, ta-ta-ra-ra, ta-ra-ra (R-r-r)

Hop in the Lamborghini (—Ghini)

Left for a minute, I do not sweat it

[Chorus]
Wow, wow, look at me, habibi
Wow, wow, Dubai drip, let’s get it
Wow, wow, look at me, habibi
