Like Yellowstone

On the phone raising bucks that's a Telaton

9/11 on the mic Troy hella bomb

Bugatti Chiron on the autobahn

My car talk to me like decepticons

Like to get the bread first like restaurants

Then you get the girls, I’m like what else you want?

You a gold digger, friends with leprechauns

Diamonds making rainbows shape of lucky charms

These knot got my pants sagging
Chubby arms

I’m a breath of fresh air, gas on Chevron

Smoking till my lungs black, Teflon

Niggas ungrateful better watch who you stepping on

Ran that marathon, fly like a carry on

Carry extra clips for war Barbadian

I be putting in overtime while they out for lunch

Bars dope as a mug no coffee cups

Your girl in my comment, you like get off his nuts

My rings on ice (bling) like a hockey puck

My team too nice you should rock wit us

Dreams became reality like Oculus

Nigga get salty so fast when you blowing up

I gave em formula, never stop showing up

Stacking up so many bucks I need a armored truck, Gucci wit the Donald Duck
It’s still fuck Donald trump

Kill a black man

Then pay his family for cover up

Ima keep cooking up this crack

Til it bubble up

Crack music

Feds I’m not stupid

They’ll take raps to the court

And include em

Judge acting like he don’t know

That we human

Watch us like

We just on a show
Hmm like Truman

They say ignorance is bliss
Like clueless
So I should rap about hoes and not do shit
Guess I should buy a lot of clothes
With bad credit
And I should copy what I see
For the aesthetic

I call my momma everyday yeah

Life moving

I call my brothers everyday yeah

Life moving

And if it’s money on table

Ima pursue it

I’m hustla baby

Ima get to it

Feel I don seen it all

I don’t been thru it

I feel like niggas ain’t ya dawg

They just wanna move up

Bite the paw that feeds you

It’s never enough

So Ima ball on you niggas

Like jigga and puff
