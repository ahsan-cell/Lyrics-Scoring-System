We're whispering in circles again
We're using different words, same meanings
You ask me if this love is worth the end (Oh-ooh, oh-ooh, oh)
You know that I've been broken before
I know that you could break me more
My instinct is to run before my heart is torn

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to hold my defences and hide behind my walls
But when I hold onto you, I can't help but let them fall

[Chorus]
So, I'll let you hold onto my heart
No, I won't run away even if you tear me apart
You know I will always stay
'Cause it's better to try and lovе too hard
Than to always be stuck at the start
So, I'll let you hold onto my hеart
'Cause loving you's worth all the scars

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh
Worth all the scars
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh

We're sitting underneath streetlights
The neon yellow lights up your eyes
If this all crumbles down, at least, we have tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I'll hold all these seconds, and memorise them all
'Cause when I hold onto you, I can't help but always fall

[Chorus]
So, I'll let you hold onto my heart
No, I won't run away even if you tear me apart
You know I will always stay
'Cause it's better to try and love too hard
Than to always be stuck at the start
So, I'll let you hold onto my heart
'Cause loving you's worth all the scars

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh
Worth all the scars
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh

[Chorus]
So, I'll let you hold onto my heart
Even if you tear me apart
'Cause it's better to try and love too hard
Than to always be stuck at the start
So, I'll let you hold onto my heart
'Cause loving you's worth all the scars
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, oh-oh-oh-ooh
Worth all the scars, ooh-ooh
Baby, loving you's worth all the scars
