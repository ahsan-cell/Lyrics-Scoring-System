I remember the first time we met
I was running late again
I was covered in glitter
You were wearing your glasses
I didn't hear a word you say

[Verse 2]:
I remember the room when we kissed
And the way you were biting my lip
When I see you smiling you still got me flying
You give me that butterfly effect

[Chorus]:
It's like 1999 again
And we kiss like we're sixteen and then
We drive to that John Legend song
And we dance without no music on

It's like 1999 again
And we're drunk on love with no regrets
And we're up until the break of dawn
And we dance without no music on

It's like
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it fells like
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it feels like
You might also like[Verse 3]:
I'm a super mess when I drink
Always trying to get you to sing
We were up on the roof top
Taking our clothes off
We were the only ones awake

[Verse 4]:
I know you like it when I put up my hair
And I'm in love with the shades that you were
From the very beggining you still got me spinning
You give me that butterfly effect

[Chorus]:
It's like 1999 again
And we kiss like we're sixteen and then
We drive to that John Legend song
And we dance without no music on

It's like 1999 again
And we're drunk on love with no regrets
And we're up until the break of dawn
And we dance without no music on

It's like
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it fells like
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it feels like
[Bridge]:
I remember the first time we met
I remember the room when we kissed
When I see you smiling you still got me flying
You give me that butterfly effect
I remember the first time we met
I remember the first time we met...

[Chorus]:
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it fells like
1999 again
And we kiss like we're sixteen and then
We drive to that John Legend song
And we dance without no music on

It's like 1999 again
And we're drunk on love with no regrets
And we're up until the break of dawn
And we dance without no music on

It's like
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it fells like
1999, 1999, 1999
It feels like, it feels like
[Outro]:
I remember the first time we met...1
