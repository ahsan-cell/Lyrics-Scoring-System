It starts with one
Head filled up passed on the dashboard
Sun high in the sky what I’m here for
No taste no way to remember
All the shit that happened in a single month back in December
I’m high, she high, girl what’s up?
Yeah I Got some money but I struggle with the drugs
It might not be raining but I’m trackin' all this mud
Do you ever feel the purpose of your life is almost done

[Hook]
Sing for me
Ride for me
Take a couple white pills get high for me
I know you would die for me
Swear to god for me
You know I’ll be right there so confide in me

[Bridge]
Everything was rough in early days
We was so intoxicated with love that we dug our grave
So all shit I used to say
Pray to god that you forgive me cuz I’m to blame
For everything I knew it all
You might also like[Hook]
Sing for me
Ride for me
Take a couple white pills get high for me
I know you would die for me
Swear to god for me
You know I’ll be right there so confide in me
