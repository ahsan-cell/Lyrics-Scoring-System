I know I promised you the world but then I took it all back
Said that I would stay but then me get up and walk
Know you tell me say fi speak up but I never waan talk
All this time I took I wish I could a give it all back
'Cause sunshine outside but inside me head dark
Money coulda never change that
And I know my pride bigger than my heart
Ain't it funny how it always comes back

[Refrão: Richie Campbell]
'Cause I know that I hurt you
But I want you to know that we even 'cause I hurt myself too
I hurt myself too, said I know that I hurt you
I want you to know that we even 'cause I hurt myself too
I hurt myself too

[Verso 2: Van Zee & Richie Campbell]
Know it's my bad that I still miss you in the morning
Man, hardly seen you this week, been wonderin' whеre you been
I'm at the same spot, baby, now it's pourin'
Wishin' I could makе you feel some more than I do right now
Deixa só falar um coche
Tenho problemas c'o flash desses cellies, não c'o love (Eh-eh)
Tenho a day-one-shawty preocupada que eu não volte (Uh-uh)
Promessas que eu não devia ter feito
Mas eu sei que não há forma de mudar
We can still change (We can still change)
You know it hurt both ways (Know this hurt both ways)
Não dá p'a disfarçar o sentimento pela noite fora
Meto demasiado tempo no meu corre
Wish we could talk one day (Talk one day)
Forget we lost our way (Forget we lost our way)
P'a ser sincero, às vezes custa pensar, girl, I hurt you
Queria poder voltar

'Cause I know that I hurt you
I want you to know that we even 'cause I hurt myself too
I hurt myself too, said I know that I hurt you (Oh-nah)
I want you to know that we even 'cause I hurt myself too
I hurt myself too

[Verso 3: Richie Campbell, Van Zee, Van Zee & Richie Campbell]
My life filled with pain
So why would anybody wanna share this life?
Could say it get better, but you know I can't lie
Girl, you know I'm cold even when I'm inside
And I beg you, wipe those tears, I dont waan see you cry (Don’t cry no more)
When was the last time you felt butterflies?
You can run to that bwoy, but no sparks, nah go fly
Tell that bredda he can have you cause you know you still mine
And change (Change)
You know it hurts both ways (You know it hurts both ways)
I guess I met the right one at the wrong time
Guess I wrote another bar that don't rhyme
Wish we could talk one day (Talk one day)
Forget we lost our way (Forget we lost our ways)
Às vezes custa pensar, girl, I hurt you
But I could never comeback

[Refrão: Van Zee, Van Zee & Richie Campbell]
'Cause I know that I hurt you
I want you to know that we're even 'cause I hurt myself too
I hurt myself too, I know that I hurt you
I want you to know that we even 'cause I hurt myself too
I hurt myself too
[Outro: Van Zee & Richie Campbell]
'Cause I know that I hurt you
I want you to know that we even 'cause I hurt myself too, I hurt myself too
Said I know that I hurt you
I need to find out if I ever can go on without you, go on without you
