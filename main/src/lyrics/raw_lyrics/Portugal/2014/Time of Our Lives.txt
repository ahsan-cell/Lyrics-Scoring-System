Amazing, can this be real?
It's like I'm living a dream
But it's how everyone feels
We celebrate with one thing

So let's wave our hands
We can sing, we can dance
I don't want this to end
Feels so good, feels so real

Allez, allez, here we go, allez
This is the time of our lives
Allez, allez, here we go, allez
This is the time of our lives (Come on!)
Allez, allez, here we go, allez
This is the time of our lives
Allez, allez, here we go, allez
This is the time of our lives
