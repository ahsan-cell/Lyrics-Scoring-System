Sip champagne at the after-party girl (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Look at my face when you're dancing, naughty girl

[Hook: Heartless]
We dancing all the nights gashi
She knows how to move her body
I think she needs somebody
That somebody is probably me (Hey)
I think you need somebody shawty
You've been looking way too lonely girl
That's why you wanna dance up on me a girl

[Verse: Heartless]
That's fine by me, shady didn't know I'm from Puerto Rico
She said: “Where did you get all that swag?”
From Rico
Suavesito
Shawty takes a flick though

She got heels, they're Prada
I got a drinking problem
I probably won't see you tomorrow

[Bridge: Heartless]

[Verse: Axzø]
That's fine by me, shorty didn't know I'm from México
Ella se pegó y me bailó sin filtro
No me hables de amor que no necesito
Cuando se lo doy, me dice: “¡Qué rico!“

Ella perrea sola hasta el suelo
Cansada del amor y los putos celos
Quiere pasarla bien por eso nos vemos
Que no pare el DJ, que hoy amanecemos

[Bridge: Heartless]
Que amanecemos (Hey, hey)
Amanecemos (Hey, hey)
Girl I'm in love (Hey, hey)

[Verse: Axzø]
Me deslumbra el brillo que tiene esa baby
Cuando yo la vi en el cielo me sentí
Esta noche sin miedo yo me pongo pa' ti
Lo hicimo' en el carro y después prendí
Desde esa noche no me olvido de ti
Cuando tú brincabas encima de mi
Diciéndome al oído que yo era tu papi
Y yo te seguí dando hasta hacerte venir (Hey)
