One pound a weed, girls and white rum
You know seh the night done
Dadda spin tune ’til the Sun come
Bridgetown badman
Man I need a girl to come wine for me
Yeah, come wine slowly
I just need a girl to come wine for me
Yeah

[Chorus]
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly, and come again
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly, and come again

[Verse 2]
Somebody come, and get my baby girl
When she start spin around like the world
She go down, come back up and she twirl
Every man in the dance a look her
But a me she want wine pon

Dem a look her
But when we go back home, she ago wine pon me...

Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly and come again
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly and come again

She hot like Lisbon in the summer

Want beat up the ting, like a drummer
Got to hold my corner

[Chorus]
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly and come again
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly and come again

One pound a weed, girls and white rum
You know seh the night done
Dadda spin tune ’til the Sun come
Man I need a girl to come wine for me
Yeah, come wine slowly
I need a girl to come wine for me
Yeah
[Chorus]
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly and come again
Slowly, slowly, slowly
Wine slowly and come again

[Verse 5]
Friday night, and the dawgs them haffi touch road
Sony just call me, fi say me turn Gold
Not even the devil, can afford my soul
Every gyal a mine, you can walk with my Globe

Check me passport
None a them bwoy them, never see no airport
Man a nun celebrity, no inna them sport
Them type a ting B-Town can’t support, no way
