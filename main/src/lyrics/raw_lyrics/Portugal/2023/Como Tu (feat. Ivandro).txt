It no longer makes sense
I don't see a future with you
My heart is broken
Go find someone like you
Like you, like you
Go find someone like you
Like you, like you

[Verse 1: Ivandro]
It might not even work, but I know you're the one I want
That's life, I learned from my mistakes
I only tend to covet what I don't have
Now that you're gone, you see my commitment
You left, but you took a piece of me
Our story is not new, so it doesn't end here
How is a guy supposed to balancе like that?
You're missing me so much that I didn't sleep today

[Pre-Chorus: Ivandro]
I miss you, I miss you
Sorry I showеd up, I should have called
I miss you, I miss you
Sorry for showing up and not letting you know

[Chorus: Bárbara Bandeira]
It no longer makes sense
I don't see a future with you
My heart is broken
Go find someone like you
Like you, like you
Go find someone like you
Like you, like you
Go find someone like...

So if I put the face down (Down)
And swing (—ing)
That's your weak point (Weak)
And my promotion (—tion)
My body is a dose of chaos in your cause (Yeah)
And you not being able to play is your deposit (Mmm)
Reactions in your pants
Baby, I can see that your body doesn't agree (It doesn't agree)
You said I was too much work
Look how many volunteers want to work now
Like you
They want to have me in practice (Yeah)
You at parties, I was in captivity (Yeah)
So this is my after party, yeah, yeah
Your love already fit in my chest (In my chest)
Your ring already fit on my finger (On my finger)
But on the way to the altar, I played
Well want me, bad want me
With the petals of the bouquet and I understood that

[Chorus: Ivandro, Bárbara Bandeira, Bárbara Bandeira & Ivandro]
It no longer makes sense
I don't see a future with you
My heart is broken
Go find someone like you
Like you, like you
Go find someone like you
Like you, like you
(Go find someone)
[Pre-Chorus: Bárbara Bandeira & Ivandro]
I miss you, I miss you
Sorry I showed up, I should have called
I miss you, I miss you
Sorry for showing up and not letting you know
