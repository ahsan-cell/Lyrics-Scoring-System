(Grrah)

[Verse 1: Matuê]
My chain and my watch are white and rosé
Everything, a candy, a V bullet
I didn't come from the countryside, I'll avenge the ones
Who avenged me just to screw you (Oh)
Disbelieve it? Just pay to see (Yeah)
Want a show? Just pay to see (Yeah)
Once they tried to stall me
To see my body make the news on TV

[Chorus: Matuê]
I got mafia connections
No one's ever gonna hold me back
Special conditions
You can't compare, we're not the same
Fiction, on TV, yeah
Kill or be killed? Yeah (Grrah)
Ye-yeah, that's the question
That's the question

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Had to stash the whole milli in the ceiling
Need a Visa for a bitch in Brazilly (Bitch)
Mob boss, my wrist is like two-fifty
Might fly to Brazil and pull out the Bentley
Show love to the kids, I'm passin' money
Hundreds, fifties, make it rain twenties
Overseas bitch saying, "Make it rain on me" (On me)
I was in the trap 'fore I had a chain on me

Beware of life, man (Man, yeah)
Death is already a guarantee, man (Man, yeah)
Watch your step, man (Man)
It could be a trap, man (Man)
(3 AM with the MAC in the groin)
And I only leave when it's daytime, man
It's like my grandma used to say, man (Ye-wo-yeah)
"Why have a life, if it ain't gonna be lived?"
Put lemon in the wound
Bad stuff makes the news
With no room for the waverer, it gets even more serious

[Chorus: Matuê & Rich The Kid]
I got mafia connections
No one's ever gonna hold me back
Special conditions
You can't compare, we're not the same
Fiction, on TV, yeah
Kill or be killed? Yeah (Grrah)
Ye-yeah, that's the question (Yeah, yeah)
That's the question (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 4: Rich The Kid]
(Mob Ties, Mob Ties)
Just for a rack, my niggas, they gettin' you wet (Mob Ties, Mob Ties)
I feel like Al Capone, Big Meech (Big Meech)
Real so they give me love in the streets (In the streets)
And the way that she feel (She feel)
Took her home from Brazil (Home from Brazil)
Mayweather its hand like a pro boxer (Pro boxer)
Kicked her out the crib like I play soccer (Soccer)
Freaky lil' bih like to play doctor
Mama walked in my room, seen a real choppa
We got big guns like the mafia (Mafia)
When you're gettin' to the money, ain't no stoppin' you (Stoppin' you)
They call me The Kid like a toddler (Toddler)
Bullet proof car like a mobster (Mobster)
[Chorus: Matuê]
I got mafia connections
No one's ever gonna hold me back
Special conditions
You can't compare, we're not the same
Fiction, on TV, yeah
Kill or be killed, yeah (Grrah)
Ye-yeah, that's the question
That's the question

[Bridge: Matuê]
Beware of life, man
Watch your step, man
It could be a trap, man
(3 AM with the MAC in the groin)
And I only leave when it's daytime, man
It's like my grandma used to say, man

[Outro: Matuê]
These are mafia connections
No one's ever gonna hold me back
Special conditions
You can't compare, we're not the same
Fiction, on TV, yeah
Kill or be killed? Yeah
That's the question
