Ice cream, ice cream
(Ice cream)

[Verse 1]
Come get it, come get it
Heavy cream in the old Honda Civic
I'm whippin' through the visits, I'm busy in the line
Take a ticket in the truck, who's with me? I'm in it
When they get to the beginning, get a flavor just pick it
On the fence no picket, no gimmick
I've been into cream since vanilla was a bean
And I'm never finished
Truck full furnished going way below the limit
Cream so sweet, got the critics on their feet
But I feel real comfy when I'm sittin'
Ice cream sleep repeat, just living

[Chorus]
Come get it, come get it, come get it, come get it
I was in the crib and I was eating like a man in a minute
Eating like a million in a minute
Now I'm on the diet sticking with it
Ice cream every day and we stay skinny, it's a given

[Verse 2]
Come get it, we did it
Selling out cones to the homes, just doing good business
Wintertime is over, good riddance
Feeling like I'm popeye with the spinach just grinnin'
Come get it, it's ready, it's ready, come get it
There's a difference, tryna make a life not a living
If you gave me a banana I would split it
I guess I got the vision
20/20, guess I'm on a mission
Come get it don't get it all wrong
Come get it by the end of the song I'm gone
Come run across the lawn
By the time it's gone sold out so long
No doubt when it gets cold out, we gone
Going south gotta sit go down respawn
Snowed out 'til the heat in the truck kicks on, we thawin'
We thought, we bought, we brought
Pretty soon in the ice cream yacht, we gone

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh this is the jingle
When we're drivin' by we'll be shakin' all your shingles
Kris Kringle with the sprinkles
No elves though
Ooh I guess that means that we did it by ourselves though
No help no wealth no concern for my health
Get well go sell don't shelf those
They don't see us coming with the stealth mode
Ooh, don't tell no they'll be stickin' to us like the velcro
Keeping sane like a sundae with the nuts gone
Preaching every Sunday on the front lawn
Make 'em wanna cry with the truck song
So you better come by when the trucks on
Flying on the ground like a duck with his clucks on
We were in a Winnebago waiting with a tux on
We were in the dusty old truck with the trunk gone
Now we got the trunk on and the dust gone
Everybody hear us, beep-beep, it's the ice cream
Every time we pull up knee-deep it's a tight heap
Swimming through the crowd in the street like a Pisces
Every time we leave we sweep 'em with the crises
Leave 'em in the night they'll fight in the moonlight
Just for spoon bite, make for a new life
We were in the blind in a blight in the June
I had to roll the dice more than twice but I'm too nice
[Chorus]
Come get it, come get it, come get it, come get it
I was in the crib and I was eating like a man in a minute
Eating like a million in a minute
Now I'm on the diet sticking with it
Ice cream every day and we stay skinny, it's a given
Selling out cones to the homes just doing good business
Wintertime is over good riddance
Wintertime is over good riddance
