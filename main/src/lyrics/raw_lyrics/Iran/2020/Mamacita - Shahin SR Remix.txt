[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
These niggas got plenty Anna but they ain't got plenty guns
I'm bustin' out luxury cars, still got these hoes on the run
I'm hearin' plenty mean words, but ain't no actions to boot
We can do some straight war for war, we can do some stickin' and movin'
We can meet in the middle of these streets or in the middle of this ring
I can pop your chest, plastic Glock, or pop your jaw diamond rings
Bitch don't hate me hate the bank, for stacks of cheese that I take
Or hate my shiny wristband, and big ass rims I rotate
See people flip when I'm comin', got suckas sick at the stomach
They wonderin' what I brought in, they wonderin' what I got comin'
Niggas I'm comin' like this, off in your mouth like a bitch
Trust me when you think of me, I'm bringing water, I'll start it
You might also like[Verse 2: Juicy J]
What's the business?
It's that player that you love to hate, always see come out the bank
Always have to mention my name, when you high on that drank
Catch up with this boy you can't, cause you know I'm holdin' rank
When you see the platinum Rolex with the ice it make you faint
Through the streets now have you heard, 'bout the Mafia droppin' birds
Runnin' from the narcs and cops, tossin' out the bags of herb
Ain't afraid to pop the steel, hollow tips to make you feel
If you wanna punk me out, Cartier's and a Dracula grill

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 3: Crunchy Black]
I can't take anymore, I'm 'bout to explode
I'm 'bout to overload, I'm 'bout to get it, boy
All I wanna know is where the G's at, where the key's at
Keep it easy, you don't want to get skeeted
All on this motherfuckin' room, nigga, boom
Lay down on your back so you can get up soon
Stab you in your heart with a har-fuckin-poon
Nigga, boom, nigga, boom
[Verse 4: Lord Infamous]
Scarecrow's on it, I'm still hungry, starvin' for a platinum supper
Wipe it easy, some black founded, crooked ass set'll be eating rubber
'Cause if they skit-skat, gun 'em all down, even ghost towns
Splish-Splash, brains on the ground, with a cannon round
Ball bat, bash him in his back, beatin' bitches down
Battleaxe blaze from the cross, body never found
Catch a close encounter cause the Anna kills off these rap bums
Chemical reaction cobra venom shot into his arm

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These...
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 5: Gangsta Boo]
Here we go, all you weak ass hoes
In my face like you my friend
Triple Six dropped in again, time to make ends
Dope game, my game, hoes lame, it's a shame
How that Gangsta Boo is runnin' the click up on you bitches man
Fat cat, what I be, packin', how you love that
Fuck a platinum plaque, gimme money, where the dollars at
(Blap, blap) You're dead in a second for 10 G's
(Where you from?) Black haven is where I be on my P's and Q's
[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Parents please, watch out for your children
This the one that'll lock 'em in the basement
Some of them talkin' so rugged, some corrupted ugly pussa-pussa
Close your fucking mouth, my nigga, Koopsta tryin' to tell ya somethin'
Peter-Peter, pussy eater, one of them fucked by Koopsta Knicca
Lord, I done some sins, cause she married, but I don't know that nigga
Figured he is a killa, so he figures he'll watch us fuckin'
Put them muthafuckin' slugs upside that thug, cuz, oh my

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These, the-these, these, these bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one of y'all step, the first one I'm a toss out

[Verse 7: Juicy J & DJ Paul]
For that dick game, wouldn't buy your bitch with my loose change
Thirsty niggas eatin' bitches ass with the shit stain
Insane like my motherfuckin' wrist game, nigga
Houses on the hill cost the same fuckin' thing
Counted up a hunnid this mornin'
Then I went spent me 50
Then I hit the VLive, tryna buy me some ass and titties
Rappers sample my old shit, keep runnin' 'em bags, I'm uh rich
Get 'em samples cleared 'cause that publish you might not get some
Niggas act like they don't owe me somethin'
I'm the reason bitches twerkin' they ass, now show me somethin'
Payin' homage is a real nigga move, bitch I paid my dues
Sold a million out the trunk, you niggas uber poo
Pour that mud up like that butter, first nigga with that pipe in the club
Used to have to turn my shit up, had niggas tryna fight in the club
Y'all leaving with them, we hit them hoes right in the club
And I know I'm icy'd up, pinky just like that dub
You gotta like my shit, you a hater or somethin'
I'm a grown ass man, you a baby or somethin'
Probably fucked yo mama on the come up in the 80's, homie
Don't you ever try to play me, homie
Got a wife now like Kanye
And I wish a bitch would try to bite her like Beyonce
My daughter 2 months and she been paid
Boutta sign more deals, cop more real estate
Me and Pat used to rob for 'em petty things
Now it's nothin' less than private jets, 7 figure checks
Hater, catch yo fuckin' breathe, you broke, ain't got nothin' left
We them niggas in Dubai from the north, don't you ever flex
Mafia, runnin' shit, Juicy J ain't never quit
Ain't a bitch I never hit, still countin' paper, bitch
When the smoke clears, nigga, I'm still here
Higher than I been in 20 goddamn years, uh
Motherfuckin' legend get your smoke right, dope right (Who run it)
Ain't no conversation for that broke life, show right,  (Who run it) bitch

[Verse 8: CupcakKe & DJ Paul]
Let me talk my shit real quick (Who run it), all the real niggas gon' feel this
How that's yo' kid but he ain't got bills? Can't find you in family pics
Food stamps, they go so quick when you up in a family of six
So it's funny how they sell that shit for a little pack of weed and a new pair of kicks
Man, I'm so dead, I can't, inside I feel so blank
Little girls on Twitter talkin' 'bout they break up, girl, sit back on Paint
If I'm alive, no complaints, none of these judges saints
Let the black beat her, that's 10 years, but if white beat her, "nice tank"
It's so ridiculous, ain't shit funny, ain't ticklish
Don't test me if I'm with the shits, end up in a cage, no Nicholas
Everything about me is interesting, I'ma need more and more Benjamins
Damn, I can't breathe, stop smoking them trees, got your insides looking like Christmas
Ungrateful hoes, get the fuck out of here, you had a rough day and I had a rough year
So when I get money I really do care, go and invest it, not spending on gear
Think about that, just stating facts, niggas don't chart when it's real rap
Earn my respect then you get it right back, that go hand in hand ain't talkin' dap
A lot of issues in my past still hurt me to this day, to the core
I don't ever open up 'cause I know people change like the oil
Over 100k up on tour, still got a mindset like I'm poor
But I'm on the roll when it come to rappin' like a pack of aluminum foil
Man, I love walking barefoot, I really like the feel when I'm at the bottom (what?)
'Cause I know it's only for a couple of seconds, then I'm right back to my stardom (that's right)
Motherfuckers ain't woke, man, I gotta fuck around and re-alarm 'em
I'm woke all day, 3 AM, when they call me Jake from State Farm
Okay, lil' bitch, act like you know, anything I say is right like nose
Walk right over there, hoe, like roach, and it's over for these hoes, no dose
Walk in that bitch with a white T, they don't really like me but you know how that goes
Walk out that bitch you would think I'm little red riding hood, how I got blood on my clothes

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 9: G Herbo]
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius (yeah)
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh (gon' inherit it)
We yell, "Gang-gang first," you don't even know your heritage (bitch)
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
"Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried"
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere (everywhere)
We still fresh, double G's everywhere (everywhere)
I put the VV's everywhere (everywhere)
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, not one day, your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, "Fuck it, no problem, it'll do"
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true (yes, it's true)
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, (vroom)
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years (what?)
I seen ten niggas get killed
What about me turnin' down them deals? (Huh)
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?

[Interlude: G Herbo]
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit

[Verse 10: Lil Uzi Vert]
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Meen's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch (facts)
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, "Elliot, bezel it," ice kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 11: 21 Savage]

I'm on Percocet's, I think I'm finna skydive (yeah)
You little pussycat, you must think you got nine lives (21)
I'm so sick of all this fruity shit, you niggas on thin ice
That stick gon' cut you half-time, now these niggas wanna switch sides (straight up)
I ain't really with that takin' shit, lil' nigga, I'm walkin' up (straight up)
That .30 like a tree lil' nigga, watch where you barkin' up (straight up)
We got way too many shots, y'all lil' niggas can't dodge enough (on God)
We can even challenge ya, 'cause y'all lil' niggas ain't charged enough (fast)
Quarter million dollar for a walkthrough (straight up)
Get the utmost respect when I walk through (straight up)
I love the way you suck that dick, lil' bitch, don't forget who taught you (straight up)
Way too much, can't stalk you (straight up)
Bogeyman, nigga, I'll haunt you (on God)
All these bullets 'round me, nigga, I ain't got time to punch you (21)
Hit 'em wit' the 3-2, all y'all niggas see through (yeah)
Broad day, I'll see food, had to hit a lick at Kiku (yeah-yeah)
Lil' bitch I don't need you (yeah-yeah)
Hell Nah, I can't eat you (yeah-yeah)
Let the whole gang G you, then I left that bitch at Jeju (yeah-yeah)
You must be scared or some, nigga, let's bet the spread or some (21)
That's your main bitch, but I bet that lil' bitch spread for some (on God)
I got all these blues like I ain't bangin' red or somethin' (trre)
I bought all these cars like l ain't got no legs or somethin' (yeah)
Fuck that other side, pull up in ya hood switch it (21)
Sex, money, murder, two guns, nigga, big B's (21)
Every time I hit that bitch she come back like a frisbee (yeah)
I ain't got time to play with nobody kids, go watch Disney (yeah)
Skin made of concrete, nigga, you can never be me (21)
My brother down the road with a touchscreen and a FeFe (BF)
Candlelight gang, leave a nigga on the TV (21)
Fish fry gang, y'all can't even afford to die
Bitch, I'm way too real, I can't even afford to lie

[Verse 12: A$AP Rocky]
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Get fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 13: Trippie Redd]
Lil' nigga let them llamas fly, leave a young nigga so traumatized
Totin' gats jit, all my niggas ride
Don't make me make another mama cry
Do a drill, catch another homicide
Fix your face, nigga, you got butterflies?
Chopper at your throat and you afraid to die
Big 14, fuck the other side
Jugg, jugg, got all this jewelry
Man, this shit ain't new to me
Your bitch new to you, she ain't new to me
I ain't really with the fucking foolery
Glistenin' in these fucking diamonds
Bad bitch and I'm fucking shining
I got a bad bitch from the fucking islands
Taking trips to the fucking islands
Guess these guys don't realize
When they talking fly, man, it's suicide
Don't talk, do a nigga do or die
Nobody else, nigga, you and I
Big chopper, I'ma let the bullets fly
That red dot right between your eyes
I don't play, pussy, wish a nigga try
'Cause that'd be the night niggas die
Niggas act like I ain't G.O.A.T. or somethin'
Take a trip, go chill with the bros or somethin'
Call a few bitches, chill with some hoes or somethin'
Niggas be flexin', they bold or somethin'
They don't want that war, go home or somethin'
Internet flexin' with the phone or somethin'
You a lil' pup, nigga, fetch a bone or somethin'
Niggas male strippers when them poles bummin'

[Bridge: Trippie Redd & Lil Yachty]

Ridin' 'round in a Maybach with my nigga Pellz
Glock out, running we empty 12
Bitch on my dick, that's a love spell (yeah)
Bitch with the shits, call her Annabelle (yeah)

Ten toes on my sole, niggas wouldn't double dare to cross the big Boat (yeah)
Last year

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

[Verse 15: Tutweezy]

[Verse 16: Young M.A.]
Twenty racks in the back of jeans
Tatted sleeves, Patek freeze
Pretty nigga, that indeed
Thottie with me, black and cream
African, Japanese
I just call her blackanese
I'm just gonna tap that and leave
I don't leave the house unless I got a bag waitin' for me at the front door
If you short on my cash, thirty niggas hoppin' out a Uber truck
So don't try your luck, hoes down to fuck
Top floor of the hotel
Smokin' weed in the bathroom, put the shower on so it's no smell
Street cold, don't tell
But I'd rather live where it's no hell
It's funny how hatin' niggas be the ones who names ring no bells
Oh well, my bitch bad
And her pussy got a soap smell
She a model, nah she a model
She a little bougie
And I'm just tryna put this big wet tongue on top of that coochie
Earlier she a little mad at me, she a little moody
Sometimes I don't understand the bitch, she a little confusing
Like half the time I don't be even doin' shit, and she be assuming
Like I ain't loyal or somethin'
You act like I don't call you or somethin'
You act like you a little spoiled or somethin'
Is you hot like you boiling somethin'?
So all you rappers it's a rap for you like aluminum foil or somethin'
Better crown her, came from the ground up, from the soil or somethin'
Been 'bout it, every nigga with me poppin' like oil or somethin'
I was slackin', had to get on track like I'm recordin' or somethin'
I hear a lot of talk, but honestly they ain't really talkin' 'bout nothin'
And nowadays I don't trust a thing, so I ain't really sure about nothin'
I just fucked your bitch in Givenchy flip flops
And yeah we spendin' money, but we also spin blocks
Bend blocks, shout out my nigga Jezz, big opps
They ain't open up them doors, I had to pick locks
Free Bobby, free Rowdy, free the whole 9
Got lit on my own nigga, didn't need a cosign
It's Red Lyfe, no red lights, green lights go time
But before you get on the road, nigga make sure you know your road signs
He asked did I fuck his bitch, I said "uh yeah nigga, four times"
My sex drive longer than my show lines, make her cum in no time
RL that's the bro sign, can't come in, we got closed sign
Can't hang here, this is not a clothesline
Fuck around and get clotheslined
No ghostwriter, I wrote mine
Wrote the whole rap and the whole rhyme
They like "MA, where the album at?"
I just need a lil' more time
I got guns, but if I ain't usin' it, no need to show mine
Don't mean I won't blow, ma
Bitch nigga, you could blow, ma
In the club I drink out the bottle, ain't no need to even pour mine
Stripper bitches don't like me 'cause I get money and don't throw mine
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me, ain't gotta say it, you already know why
If I had a dick, you could suck it
If I had nuts, you could hold mine

[Refrain: Young M.A.]
I said, if I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Haha
If I had some nuts, you could hold mine
Fuck y'all niggas
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 17: Bhad Bhabie]
Ayy
When I look around, don't see nobody in my lane
See these rappers need the clout, that's why they always say my name
I'm only gettin' better, bitter bitch it ain't gon' change
Why you tryna hang around me, bitch, get off 'cause you ain't gang
You ain't gang, treat you like a stain
All my biz is straight, I'd still be good without the fame
I got so many cousins, aunts, uncles that I never knew
On me for my revenue, I'm big now like I'm 7'2"
New whip and my leather smooth, try me, I'ma play it cool
Windows down, AC blowin', 20 below, I'm extra cool
You lookin' fed up 'cause of my bread up, I keep my head to the sky
Run up, [?] and I'm back to [?] where I'm droppin' the fire
Who want it? Tell me, bitches, who blunted?
You ain't know my crew run it? All we see is blue hundreds
On my dash, 200, these bitches sad and can't run it
Ho I'm a star, you wanna walkthrough you better tell me who fundin'

[Verse 18: Crank Lucas]

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out

[Verse 19: Chevy Woods & Wiz Khalifa]
Ay bitch, this a brand new chain
Put her in Vera Wang
She got a crazy top
I let her go insane
G-shit in my veins
Limited seats on my plane
Get to the country they know my name
I could pay for anything I'm ordering
Whether it's bitches, California weed, fourth down
Got 20 inches
I'm rolling up hella green by the pound
You wanna pinch this
Wondering what the stench is
Always played my position
We balling cause we the realest
...

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first one a' y'all step, the first one I'm'a toss out

[Verse 20: Roy Purdy]
Just make sure to always stay true to who you are", and I did that
Jeans black with a pink hat
Sorry, I don't wanna come to ya kickback
Oh no, so cold like Frozone
9-2-0, what I rep, that's home
Big racks, big facts, no foolery
Got 'em like "God damn, man, who is he?"
It's me, ya boy Roy so crispy
Really had to go and hit 'em with the quick speed
Too fast, look left, look right
You ain't gon' see nothin' like me in sight
Hit my dance real quick, ouu, I just might
Wanna sleep on me? Okay, good night
I'm gone, new song comin' soon
Ya boy Roy really been up in the stu'
It's nothin' new, yeah, this what I do
Been makin' music way before all the views
Whi-white T with the white vans
Oh man, god damn, I'm fresh
Kickin', laid back, life's good, no stress
I don't gotta flex, you know I'm up next
Sike, bitch, I'm up now
I'm holdin' it down
I'm feelin' great
I cannot frown
"Who Run It" remix
Just something light
Had to snap real quick, now I'm droppin' the mic
Okay

[Verse 21: Slim Jesus]
Ayy, ayy, gang
Y'all know how the fuck I'm rockin' man
I'm hearin' a whole lot of talk about who run this shit
I be countin' stacks
Who run Ohio, that's me
Which one of y'all hotter than me?
Leave the beat like a hundred degrees
And it's still all this ice on me
Who getting plays like me?
Who getting paid like me?
Y'all was not made like me
And I put that on my G's
Remember they hated on me
I knew all I needed was cheese
Ran it up and I blew it on jeans
Had to run it back up times three
None of y'all wanna be like me
Run around with them pipes like me
Fresh pair of Off-Whites on my feet
Gold chain on a Polo white tee
In a trap with a whole lot of P's
Smoking dope 'til we Vietnamese
I threw bro lil thirty
He threw like fifty to me
All of these rappers is broke
That shit be sickening to me
You blew the whole bag on the road
You look like a victim to me
I just pulled up in a foreign
And you got a Honda on E
All black tints on all my whips
'Cause I know they're looking for me
Just know wherever I go
It's a glizzy with me right up under the seat
I give a fuck what you claiming you is
You can get touched with the heat
I remember being irrelevant
Now I get bands for all of my feats
Remember totin' tourists
Now we got AR's that's chopping down trees
It's a fifty on bro and a thirty on me
You don't really really want the beef
You can talk that shit on the internet
Run up, get done up, get wrapped up in sheets
They was talking crazy last night
'Til a hundred shots hit they block
I don't even know who got hit with that shit
But we smoking all opps
Everywhere I go I'm with the gang
It's at least three or four of them Glocks
If you speaking on who run it, ain't say my name, you smoking on rocks
I'm in the street like fuck 12, bitch I'm off the Henny
You can find me with the gang 'cause I don't fuck with many
Them my brothers, if I'm busting they gon' dump it with me
They know I'm a threat and that's the reason they ain't fucking with me, gang

[Bridge: Chris Travis]:

Niggas goin down fast like stop drop

Niggas switch in my lane but I can't stop

[Verse 23: TA Double Dolla]
They say I'm bougie and cocky

Threw a bag at my baby mama here you go, go shopping
Every other day I'm waking up to new money
Gettin deposits in
From negative to positive
Dollar boy just landed
In the city of angels
...

[Verse 24: Idontknowjeffery]
Point me out to who run it
Fuckin' man or a woman
I kick they ass in the stomach until they vomit from it
Nigga I'm sick I'm bubonic and you and that bitch is platonic
Stab your ass in the stomach and clean the mess up with Comet
Fuck all that extra shit
I'm in the bed with a naked bitch and her head just twist like damn exorcist
What ya tryna posses me with
The way she suck my dick was an accident cause I ain't even have to ask the bitch
Nigga I'm stingy as hell
I'm face my hoes nigga I don't even pass the bitch
And I shit on niggas on accident like I ate some laxatives
Try to impress me with that bullshit turn him to an acronym
Nigga its Prick Harper
I'm a shit starter
And all that bullshit you talkin' make my dick harder
I treat a rapper like his father I don't text him I don't call him
I don't bother
Nigga I let the Glock solve problems

[Verse 25: Xavier Wulf]
These rappers ain't runnin' shit but ya bitch
Who, where she at?
She at the crib tryna cook me something every damn day
Told her "bitch I do it better" by myself go move away
Here to stay
Up from now until whenever the fuck I say
...
Well I could I ain't never had a juug but I had a blunt to finish
You rap niggas still capping
...
Pulled up with a bitch so thick I'ma leave a little bit early just to hit
...
Serotonin too lit
I don't give a fuck 'bout you, him, them

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 26: Rico Recklezz]

[Verse 27: Jeremih]
Lil' mama give me head 'til I'm dead, I call it brainstormin'
You ain't even halfway 'Yonce, I could put a ring on it
Pop, country, rap, trap, punk, rock, I could still sing on it
On the block wit' niggas big as Shaq but I could still hang on it
3 story, no story, no Tory, this a different lane on 'em
Lane to lane, white ghost, red gust, that's a candy cane, homie
Everybody wanna be the king but who gon' make the claim for it
I'ma say me for the moment
[?]
So [?], I ain't scared or nothin'
Chicago made me a bear or somethin'
I just skydive, I'm so live, you could catch me comin' out the air or somethin'
Lost some niggas gettin' this money, still got a pocket full of dead homies
Got a bad bitch wit' a head on her
Versace robe, two bands for it
It's God's plan, I ain't playin' for it
I'm just tryna be the landlord
I came to fuck up the buildin'
Hitman, I'm gon' make a killin'
I'm used to shoppin' at Sears, now I be shoppin' wit Siri
Used to be stealin' cologne, now I be stealin' your bitches

[Bridge]
Yeah
Nah mean?
[?]
[?] slow it down, you know?
Go the other way on 'em

[Verse 28: Jeremih]
Yeah
Pull up to the Valley, car got no keys
Diamond pinky ring cost a low key
Make a play [?], you should proceed
Big ballin', put the money on the flo' seats
Bank account always doin' backflips
Used to have the walls and the matress
Numbers still the same since the old me
Don't get it fucked up, I ain't the old me
Who run it? Now who run it?
My pockets on cucumber
I'ma have yo' girl over
Have her speakin' boonomics
Got the Kevin Gates, I got that two phones, I got two numbers
Ain't talking YouTube numbers
I could take a few summers

[Verse 33: Dax]
Had to come here and enlighten
Had to come give you the facts, trapping is wack
You might get a stack
Your daughter at home, your mama still crying
Blacks in America dying
Trump in office, he wildin'
Droppin these bars for fun, we going to war
But look at the timing, buying
They put me in chains, confined me
I'm rapping the real but can't get a deal
These niggas is not replying
Why the system be falsifying?
They say that I might be crazy
They say that my shit too real
The reason that they cannot play me
Industry cannot detain me
A cross of Pac and Baby
I've been to hell and back, that's why they say they cannot save me
Ain't poppin' no pills, I stay in the field
These niggas is fakes, they mad that I'm real
I see that you broke, don't know how that feel
You gave up your life by signin' a deal
Might shout out to Kaep for taking a kneel
Might shout out to Jag for rappin the real
My bars is guns, they can't conceal
These niggas dumb
Not a rapper, I be in my own division
Save the world by 2020, nigga I be on a mission
I just started and I'm right exactly where I had envisioned
Niggas blind, that's why I rap, to clear their motherfucking vision
Fucking on the game
Fucking on you bitches who've been fucking for the fame
I've be getting rich and dodging niggas who ain't changed
Tried to tell my shooters, had to read [?] out the chain
With a bitty lil name, lil nigga you ain't gang
You not, circle small, like a dot
Keep it tight 'cause people like to come and try and make you fall
I've seen it all, it's fine
They'll try and stop your shine
They snakes, still smile up in your face but talk that shit behind, behind
I seen it all baby, watch out for these snakes in the grass
They sayin' just enough to your face to keep you happy
That way in case you do make it, they can say they been there
Ayy DJ cut the beat, cut the beat

[Bridge: Dax]
Hip hop is not dead and never left
It's just a book collectin' dust I found on the shelf
I don't care if you wanna read it or anybody else
'Cause I'll turn myself to Jesus and resurrect it myself

[Verse 34: 6ix9ine]
Yo, I usually don't do this
But you know what I'm saying
Had to come body bag this one time
Niggas really thought I was in jail or something
Momma didn't raise no hoe or something
I was really in the store bought a Snickers or something
I - I was trapping in the-in the way back and I got that
And I flip that and I really get that
But I told my mom "I don't do that!"
But she was really there
And I told her that "Yeah, I'm coming in,"
But she was like, "Nah, don't come near"
And I was like, "GED"
And I said, "I flip that, really get that"
I whip that and I hit that and I-yeah
LA see you next week, Coachella I'm here today
But fuck that we here and we live wit' TR3YWAY
Fuck that umm
Cut it

[Verse 35: Futuristic]

[Verse 36: BlocBoy JB]
Pulled up with that stick, hey, nigga don't miss
Got your bitch, she on her knees, she gon' eat the dick
Smoking strong, that Hercules, you can't tell me shit
Thirty-four ounces of Barkley, Phoenix versus Knicks
Walk in this bitch with my stack out
Please don't run, I got the MAC out
This nigga just made me blackout
I'm 'bout to box him like Pacquiao (doon-doon-doon)
Kurt Angle, I'm making her tap out

This shit is facts now, you can get whacked now
Watch in your face, tell me how you gon' act now, bitch
Icy, that my jewels, kick shit like kung fu
Four hundred rounds in the Rover, nigga who are you?
Put the car in cruise, and let off forty-two
You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo
Riding with my motherfuckin' dogs, bruh
You ain't got no money, I can't call you
Put two up in your back, John Wall you
All this purple on me homie, I'm a baller
Crip, crip, crip, crip, crip, crip crip crip
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

You know I'm riding with my dog, just like Scooby-Doo (crip)

I got gold gold on my throat, diamonds in my teeth (ice)
Clarity, clarity, clarity, clarity, all this ice on me (ice)
Got this bad bitch with blonde hair, I call her Russian Cream
And I got that baby chopper, I'll rock your ass to sleep
Can't stand me, take a seat (ho), designer head to feet, yeah
Everything on fleek, Cartier on me, yeah
I dress like a geek, yeah, boy your swag is weak, yeah
That shit is so cheap, yeah, my shit overseas, yeah
I'm fly like a butterfly and I sting like a bee, yeah
Call me Glock Ali, yeah, diamonds fighting like Tina
Turner, bitch I turn up, Royal Rumble
Thirty niggas with me and you know they ready to burn you
Knuck if you buck, run up and you get done up
No I'm not from Louisville, but bitch I keep my slugger
Straight up out the jungle, ain't no talk or tussle
Got no time to scuffle, I'm 'bout my chips like Ruffles
Workin like a butler, ain't no more struggle
Tell these niggas catch up, tennis chains mustard
Ran up my racks, run and tell that
Ran through a bag and got that shit right back
These niggas ain't doing shit, these niggas ain't talkin' jack
You niggas ain't running shit, this chopper make you run a lap
Yeah
Glizzock

[Verse 38: Ballout]
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
I'm in a truck called SRT or somethin'
Doin' Need for Speed or somethin'
Hundred thousand my key or somethin'
Two hundred my Jeep or somethin'
Niggas broke as hell actin' like they don't know how to eat or somethin'
Miami Beach Louis sandals, know I got my heat or somethin'
At the condo, you can't get in unless you got a key or somethin'
Smokin' out the 440 and it smoke a P or somethin'
Took the doors off, ridin' through Cali in my Jeep stuntin'
Long as they print money it's gon' keep comin'
I know you hear my Jeep runnin'
I ain't pumpin' gas, they gon' keep pumpin'
Ride through the hood and they keep honkin'
People look at me and they see money
I'm a boss, d-money
Load em' people up, my phone gon' keep jumpin'
They like "Ball, is it weed or is it d-money?"
Bankroll like street money
Walk in Neiman's, leave the Hellcat and the Jeep runnin

[Verse 39: Chief Keef]
My bitch said she gon' leave me like she complete somethin'
Bitch, you [?] met you at 2:30 and fucked your ass at 3 somethin'
Who you run up on? Not us
I'ma take my own heat, shoot three or somethin'
Might be in the trap, call Jeep or somethin'
Might get Ball with a whole P or somethin'
Might be in SRT or somethin'
Krispy might make a bitch cream or somethin'
Cross that red line, get a beam or somethin'
Wake you up like you had a bad dream or somethin'
Who, Chief Sosa think he Rambo?
I was in the field with the lizard
Doing spinouts since the blizzard
Like Snoop Dogg "What's the wiz-zard?"
Disappear on that bitch like a wizard
And I'm cuttin' real sharp like a scissor
Roll by so fast, Big Dipper
I'm in LA more than a Clipper
Balenciaga more than a owner
Bitch, we out here more than a corner
Smoke way more dope than a stoner
And I drink way more than Homer
I can see like Christopher Columbus
Juiceman, the trap house bunkin'
You niggas ain't talkin' 'bout nothin'
King Sosa don't care about nothin'
F on my shirt, on my feet double Gs
Start gettin' F's in sixth grade, couldn't even get a couple B's
All for my habit, whats the fee? A couple G's
Aye lil' bitch, these Moncler, no need to buckle these
Aye lil' baby, these not me, no need to upload these
And when you hear that [?], bitch that's me up your street
And just make you think about when they put that thing up your teeth
Lil' nigga said up yo chest talkin' to me, up your speech

[Verse 40: Chief Keef & Ballout]
Pullin' off from Neiman's doin' donuts in the Jeep
Track [?] Look like Black Hawk flying out the street
Hopped out for twenty minutes for a backend
Seen your girlfriends tryna get back in
Hopped in the Hellcat, had to put the track in
Ball, you got the blues, why the fuck you blackin'?
Ball, you can rap, why you steady trappin'?
'Cause I get it for the L-O like Shawty nigga, tap in
Sosa, why you pay a thousand for that headband?
Because Ben Franklin is a dead man
Any time you see me, wonder that's that bread man
If he step in front his gun, then that's a brave man

[Chorus: DJ Paul]

[Verse 41: Moneybagg Yo]
Pink and purple in my cup, I'm Lil Pump-in'
Trap jumpin' (like what, like what?)
Like some fingers, it's thumpin'
Who done it?
Pockets fat with bricks of hundreds, I'm Klump-in' (Sherman)
I run it
Headed to the top, like quickies I'm comin' (ugh ugh)
Bagg
Talkin' 'bout quickies, I'm comin'
Ugh ugh, yeah
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em
Get hit for lookin' suspicious (watch how you look)
Diamonds wet, they gon' wash the dishes
Sittin' in the coupe with the missus, Whitney
If you bad you can fuck her with me
I'm taking chances, risks (risks)
Learn how to dance, my wrist did (Breezy)
I'm like the Memphis Kendrick (Lamar)
I was broke, now I"m a rich kid (look at my shoes, watch me plug walk)
This new freezer cost right here sixty (sixty K, shout out to Icebox)
AP ring and watch Jordan Pippen (duo)
And you know I run this shit, pockets keep me limpin'
2 Heartless, 2 Heartless, two of 'em, yeah

[Verse 42: Skippa Da Flippa]
Flippa
I get trippy like three six
I just hit a bad bitch with my new bitch
I don't do Kel-Tec, FN can't miss
Souped up box Chevy came with a kill switch (kill out)
I stack bread, mister winners (stack it)
I drive a tank in the winter (kill 'em)
No L's, nigga I'm a winner
This year is not for beginners
These pair of [?] call 'em Sprinters
Seventy K for a new straight A
I'm havin' shooters, no mayday
Every day to me is more money Monday
And my neck is cold like I ate a sundae
Get up, stack the money, never switch up
A hundred for the Patty, know I stay lit up
I'm pushin' for greatness but I don't do sit-ups
And I love a bitch that can get my dick up
I been quiet but I can really start a riot
You can get it grilled or fried
Your favorite rapper be cappin' with lies
I call it burnt out and tied, therefore we don't have ties
Water on me, submarine
Break the pot, I cook up clean
What's the blue strip without greens
When it comes [?] I'm the king
I say I'm too blunt, I'm not mean
Good game from an old head, call him Sega
Ice talk crazy on the Razr
I keep it player, new crib got layers
It ain't 'bout paper, I'll talk to you later
I give you pimpin', but I stay drippin'
You small like a wiz then I ball like I'm Pippen
You be slippin', they call you Tristan
You tell the tea so I named you Lipton
Hundred bows, kicked a hundred doors
They cash me out then I bring a hundred more
New Rari came with Lambo doors
House in Berlin came with three stoves
She ride the dick, no Rodeo Drive
Hit you with a combo, you get two sides
Black excellence, I'm excellent
I bought the block back for the Nobel Prize
Pink slip shawty right now 'cause I'm on
You pop big shit now then it's on
Think smart, first get a call then a home
You don't need a loan, get a zone, get it gone
I'm on my ten flip now, get your own
AP two-tone freeze, honeycomb
I'm lightskinned, call me Kev Combs
And I get money, badda-bing badda-bom
I could count a whole hundred in your face
I got air, fuck a pair of human race
Walk in safe, look like a Chase
Dipped out my safe and it turned to a chase
You tryna be me, I bet you gon' fail
Big checks comin', now I check the mail
I'm thinkin' money, blue or green hundreds
House in the hills, it look like a whale's (whoa)
I could say somethin' but it ain't the time
It ain't on me if ain't mine, eliminate me with a lime
I got heart of a lion, if I said they ain't bitin' I'd be lyin'
Lowkey in a low-rider, I write mines, no ghostwriter
I be leanin' and lookin' for the new Spider
I'm on fire and my chains firefighter (Flippa)

[Verse 43: Cdot Honcho]
I paid a G for my sneakers bitch
These ain’t no regular Adidas, hah
Have fo'nem parked outside your shit
Like your shit an arena
I’m up on Hollywood Boulevard
Fo'nem with me, not a bodyguard
Try it, you know they be choppin' shit
Might turn this bitch to a lumberyard
I was the first one in SRT
And I drove that bitch like a bumper car
I got your bitch up on DVD
Ain’t got a heart, need another heart
Roc, he'll circle around your block
On point like he really can’t find a park
Pop out you only gon' see a spark
Police said they only seen a dart
I got ten K in my joggers, ayy
You don’t want problems
Five on your head, niggas gon' pop out your closet
Smokin' biscotti, too much gelato
Feel like I’m sitting on a rocket
Ain’t no more space in my pockets
Ain’t no more space in my closet either
I just be thinking 'bout profit
I'm in the coupe with a mamacita
She only good for the noggin
That bitch know she got a mouth on her
She eat me up then I’m out on her
No we don’t play with the police games
She know we put a route on her
Look I ain't shit, with another one
Nothing was given l ran it up, bitch

[Verse 44: Sauce Walka]
If I really want his body I'ma sleep in the grass
If I get my hands dirty I'ma wash 'em in gas
Get that gunpowder off me, roll a wood up, and laugh
'cause I'm really 'bout that murder, I'll smoke your ass
Pay a bitch to wrap you with a cord and choke your ass nigga
Yeah I could get on some evil shit
Rip out your heart like a demon shit
Send body parts to your people shit
Yeah I send your hands to your mama
I send your legs to your daddy
I send your eyes to your granny
I send your foot to your daughter
Fuck it, the label some horror
Fuck it, the label some saw
Granny playin' guitar, 'cause you ain't never ever comin' back no more
I got guns when it comes to the store
I got guns that you niggas can't order
I got guns that you never can borrow
I got guns that can still shoot good underwater
I got guns that can shoot through brick walls, I got guns that got night vision
I got guns that shoot hand grenades, I got handguns that hold fifty
I got guns with long barrels on 'em, look so ugly, shoot so pretty
I got guns in my bitch titties, moral is don't fuck with me
If it's an issue we see him 'bout it, if it's an issue we be about it
It ain't a question if we about it, it ain't a question if we about it
Master P, yeah I'm 'bout it 'bout it
'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it 'bout it, 'bout it
Ran up him with a shotty, ran up on him with a shotgun
Make him jump like a pop gun, let both kids play with pop guns
Like a needle I'ma pop somethin', like a football I'ma drop somethin'
Ooh-wee
Who done it? who done it?
Who done it? who done it? nigga
The kid done did, one and done nigga
Sorry for the Sauce 3
Who done it? who done it? me

[Chorus: DJ Paul]
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth
Cause the first hater step, the first hater get tossed out
These bitches ain't runnin' (runnin'!), shit but y'all mouth

Cause the first one a' y'all step...

Niggas came up on this side, now they on the other side (word, word, word)
Oh well, fuck 'em, dawg, we gon' see how hard they ride (huh, fuck 'em)
I get racks to go outside and I split it with the guys (outside)
We up on the other side, niggas actin' like we tied
I've been gone since, like, July, niggas actin' like I died
They won't be expectin' shit when Capo go to slide (hah)
'Cause I told them that we put that shit behind us but I lied (hah)

[Verse 1: Drake]
Ayy, ayy, look who I'm around, man
If I fucked up, I'ma be downtown, man
Fourth floor bound, man, that's if I get caught, man
Pushed me to the edge, so it really ain't my mothafuckin' fault
Man, I'm not to blame, man, this fuckin' industry is cutthroat
I'm not the same, man, and I could let you check the tag now
I'm rockin' name brand, I'm only chasin' after bags now
I got a game plan and I'm out here with the woo!

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
700, three high fives, look alive, look alive ('live)

[Bridge: Joyner Lucas]
508 all on my side, they gon' ride, they gon' ride
Nigga, this a homicide, oh my god, oh my god
I said I was gon' retire, bitch I lied, bitch I lied
I ain't got no fucking job, this my life, this my, wait—

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
All of y'all wishy and washy
All y'all my kids in a car seat
I take my dime to hibachi, we do 69 like Tekashi
Lyin' in the sand, too much time in your hands, I think I need to find you a hobby
God got a plan, hope that God hold your hand, I think I'm 'bout to catch me a body!
Tell all my teachers that I said I'm back on my G shit and I'm coming back to get even
I went on tour and got paid, now I'm back in the region, I let off this mac for no reason
You are now witnessing greatness, I'm practically preaching and this is the passion of Jesus
And all you basic motherfuckas are lacking achievement, and I've just been laughing and geekin'
Back to business, I got mad intentions, I ain't perfect, I done made some bad decisions
But it's competition, I'm a savage winning
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician
I don't see you niggas, I've been lacking vision
You've been acting different, I've been acting distant
I'ma do some shit to bring me mad attention
You gon' do some shit that send me back to prison, whoa!
This is uncomfortable, you just keep putting your feet in a fire
I think my gun got a crush on you, boy, you 'bout to meet your secret admirer
How you do shit you don't wanna do? I do that shit just to keep me inspired
I used to hit it and leave when I wanted to, now I hit it and be sleepin' inside her, woo
Roll up on 'em when I pull up on 'em, put that motherfucking smoke up on 'em with that holy water
Joyner Lucas, I'm a holy mona leader motor runnin'
Man, too many niggas know about it, but I thought about it
Prayed about it to the Lord about it in the morning, but I gotta show 'em what it's all about and I'ma call 'em out
I ain't that nigga you could talk about, you better calm it down
Don't be tryna give me the runaround, I'ma shut 'em down god damn, wait

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)

[Verse 3: Rocky Badd]
Ayy, ayy
Look who I'm around man
A couple people switched, that's why you don't see 'em round man
Four four down man, know that that's a man down
I make bitches stand down then make them put they heads down
Only time you sendin' shots is when you sneak dissin'
Only time I'm on the block is when the bitches send chicken
I ain't trippin' on that nigga, he don't call unless it's business
I ain't trippin' on these bitches, once they eat they in they feelings
I ain't trippin' on no rapper that can't fight but in my business
Get to trippin' on that rapper, if she start I gotta finish
And if you fuck your niggas you can't call them boys your killers
'Cause they playin' with your feelings, mines ain't playin' with these niggas, haha
And I got shit they want but the shit they cannot buy
Bitches brazy on they Live but they barely go outside
I seen pussy in they eyes, I said fuck it, let' em slide
Told 'em I won't text these bitches, I just ho 'em, but I lied
I don't know why bitches tryin' while they funds lookin' tied
I can't trip because they lyin', let 'em take it up with God
These bitches plan winning, we gon' see how hard they grind
'Cause I push these bitches back every time I spit a line, haha

[Chorus: Drake & BlocBoy JB]
901 Shelby Drive, look alive, look alive ('live)

Enemies gon' bleed, once I let these bullets fly, man
Mama's gonna cry, man, I like to get motherfuckin' high
Man, you're not the guy, man

Shout my nigga Greatness Dex, that's my fucking right hand

Ay, stay alive, stay alive (stay alive)
Stick on me right now, Skep I lie?
Think I'm just a rapper, they like "Suspect is the guy"
'Cause they won't be expectin' it when we make gutter slide
Catch you pussy niggas by surprise
