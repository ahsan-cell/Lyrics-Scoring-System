Hollow heads shot when I put bars through them
They ain't soul-ful cuz they got no crunch
But I'll crush them up and leave dust above
Utha mai kabar se, awaaz ye amar
Maine panne jalaaye, khaaya naa koi rehem
Iss siyaahi ke dariye mein anginat doobe
Jab se knight on the mic aur hua shuru ye safar
Those good old days, still stay fresh
Tabhi bande yeh jee rhe beete hue daur mein
So I gave them all, a sick bed rest
A 6 ft. grave; graced death to them
These еlements combined can't compound for mе
I came out of blue, naa socha 'kar paaunga nhi'
So I leave them blue when soak them in ink
And feed them bars aur gunpowder bhi
Fight over breads while I toast on my victories
Dark hai ye night, they can't go through the dim streets
Papers make me sick so I sneeze all night
Gimme daylight, I'll stuff them like grilled cheese
I've got bars, the cause for my sickness
But it ain't fading away, gotta drill them up till death
Making my pencil Just dance on that black book
The time will too end, jab mai uth jaaunga likh ke
Duba rakhe maine panne duwaon mein
Meethe kyu lage mere fal gunahon ke?
Tajurbe mein chhup ke, they all play dumb
Got guts under sleeve, pale aasteen mein fan
Saadgi pasand hai, nakaab naa
Samshaan hai ghar, yeh makaan naa
Sikhaaya jisne, rehna dharti par
Khud dhool kyu jhonka? mai naa jaanta
Rekhaaein kheenchi aur bheda hai unko
Duniya ek khel, maine khela naa jinko
Chadhti dhoop se doobti saanjh tak
Ek kaagaz ke tukde par deta sab likh woYou might also like
