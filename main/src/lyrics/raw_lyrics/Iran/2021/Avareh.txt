Take pride in the life you make
'Cuz life's more than just a game you play
It's an uphill battle, but I'm on my way
Don't listen to what others say
Take pride in the life you make
'Cuz life's more than just a game you play
It's an uphill battle, but I'm on my way

Life is a fantasy, how can it be awful?
I'm shaky as a tambourine, and panicking also
Got me stammering, I can't believe in tomorrow
All I plan to be is terribly lost, so
I sit back writing lyrics onto this pad
I'm mismatched, I'm a mistake like syntax
And this hate makes me insane, you get that?
I don't even know what the hell that I'm pissed at
I'm talking to the air & the walls, it isn't fair
And there's all too much to bear, I don't wanna really care
And it really doesn't matter, 'cuz I got the shit prepared
I am toxic, I'm aware rather than confident or scared
Life is a fantasy, how can it be awful?
Honestly, my family is damaging, also
I push these people into the background
Take a look back, and then look where I'm at now

I got trouble with my prudence
I'm a victim of impudence
Often feel like I'm in ruins, though I've got so much ahead of me
Grew up as a shy child
Felt like I was exiled
Never really cracked a smile, until I was in my teens
Nearly given up about a hundred times before
But then, every time I came back just as thunderous as Thor
Now I'm never looking back again
'Cuz life's different than it was back then
Crafting verses with my paper & pen
I often wonder if I'll ever go top ten
But life's not about being the best
In fact, I don't mind my lack of success
I just want my message to get expressed
Then maybe, more people will wanna invest
Come lights out, may I peacefully rest
After I'm gone, and I've completed my quest
Don't listen to what others say
Take pride in the life you make
'Cuz life's more than just a game you play
It's an uphill battle, but I'm on my way
Don't listen to what others say
Take pride in the life you make
'Cuz life's more than just a game you play

Don't you know how life can be sometimes?
People ask me if I am just fine
But my entire life's becoming untied
Makes me wanna just say "fuck life"
Once upon a time, I felt like I was a fool
People called me gay, and made me feel like a fool
All my classmates, they were being so cruel
Nearly lost myself in middle school
Riddle me this, how is life supposed to be?
Is there some kind of hidden destiny?
If so, count me in to pay the fee
Just need someone to be real with me
In conclusion, I've been straightening out
My potential is beyond any doubt
To my endeavors, I am ever devout
Let me show you what it's all about
Don't listen to what others say
Take pride in the life you make
'Cuz life's more than just a game you play
It's an uphill battle, but I'm on my way
Don't listen to what others say
Take pride in the life you make
'Cuz life's more than just a game you play
It's an uphill battle, but I'm on my way
