I still remember every second, every minute, every hour
The day you left me there
There was a cold, bad day in summer
I was 14, I was a child
You were a big boy
My own desire...

If you feel there is no love
If you wonder why you suffered for so long
So, baby girl
Please be strong, be strong

I still got memories
I keep them under my bed
Every day I gotta sleep with them
There's no regrets, but I hope I'll forget
No way for turning back. (x2)

La, la... Yeah... memories
La, la... Ohh ohh memories

I was 14, I was a child
No nothing really, really mattered
Cause everything, little thing was dressed in pink
And you love, got me blind... and you love, got me blind
La la la la like no other

So, you baby girl
Please be strong, be strong
