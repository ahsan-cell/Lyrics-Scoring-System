For you
I run a million miles
'Cause you
Make me feel complete
And you
Every time you smile
My love
I can feel the heat

[Pre-Chorus: REEA]
'Cause only you
I can be for your love
I can live for your love
'Cause only you
I can be for your love
I can live for your love

[Chorus: REEA, Adrian Sînă]
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Bohema-ema flame
You wrapped me like a chain
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Bohema-ema flame
You wrapped me...
You wrapped me like a chain

For you
I’d swim in deepest sea
'Cause you
You're all I need
And you
My highest mountain peak
My love
You're my only creed

[Pre-Chorus: REEA]
'Cause only you
I can be for your love
I can live for your love
'Cause only you
I can be for your love
I can live for your love

[Chorus: REEA, Adrian Sînă]
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Bohema-ema flame
You wrapped me like a chain
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
Bohema-ema flame
You wrapped me...
You wrapped me like a chain1
