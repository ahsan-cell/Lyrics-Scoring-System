Rise up I'm with you
Fall down I'll fall too
Where you go, where you go
Where you go, where you go
Winds and water come
Beams and burning suns
Undivided ones

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll follow you follow you follow you on
Bolts from lightning guns

[Chorus]
Beats and battle drums
Beats and battle drums
Beats and battle drums
We were born in stars, thousand miles apart
Since our burning start, it's the way we are
And I'll follow you follow you follow you on
Bolts from lightning guns
Beats and battle drums

[Verse 2]
Breathe, breathe, we'll shine through
Clouds part when we move
Where you go, where you go
Where you go, where you go
Hundred times or once
Ancient words and songs
Undivided ones
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll follow you follow you follow you on
Bolts from lightning guns

[Chorus]
Beats and battle drums
Beats and battle drums
Beats and battle drums
We were born in stars, thousand miles apart
Since our burning start, it's the way we are
And I'll follow you follow you follow you on
Bolts from lightning guns
Beats and battle drums

[Outro]
Beats and battle drums
Beats and battle drums
