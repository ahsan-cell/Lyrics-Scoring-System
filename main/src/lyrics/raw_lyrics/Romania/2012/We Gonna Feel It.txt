Kilgrave arrives at Jessica’s apartment, walks around, opens the drawers of her file, and even relieves himself in the bathroom. There is  knocking on the door. Kilgrave opens it. It’s Ruben, holding a plate.

RUBEN: Who are you? And what are you doing in Jessica's apartment with all the lights off?

KILGRAVE: The lights are off to suggest no one is here. But you couldn't take a hint.

RUBEN: Because someone is here.  But not Jessica?

KILGRAVE: Tell me, who are you?

RUBEN: : My name is RUBEN. I'm her neighbor. I made her banana bread.

KILGRAVE: Why?

RUBEN: Because I love her.

KILGRAVE reacts with a silent death glare.
CUT TO: A BAR
Jessica is being pushed outside by the bartender.

JESSICA: Get off me!
Bartender: You're cut off!

JESSICA falls on the garbage bags outside.:

JESSICA:  I was just leaving. You didn't kick me out, I left.

A homeless man rises from another part of the garbage.

BEGGAR: You stink.

JESSICA:  Well, I'm a piece of shit, and shit stinks.

BEGGAR:  Got a dollar?

JESSICA scoffs and groans looking around in her jacket. She takes out a pice of paper.

JESSICA: Blimpie's punch card. Two away from a free sub.

After the beggar gets it, Jessica sits. She sees the entrance to Thompson Square Free Clinic  nearby, and some employees leaving, including Wendy.

JESSICA: About time.

Jessica gets up, and starts walking after Wendy on the streets. She comes to her in a subway station as Wendy fiddles with her phone, waiting for the train.

JESSICA: Hey, Wendy.
WENDY: Jessica. Have you been following me?

JESSICA: I'm usually stealthier. (Unfolds an envelope) You're gonna sign these divorce papers.

WENDY: I am not gonna sign anything on the subway platform in the middle of the night. Have Jeri call my lawyer.

JESSICA gets angry, grabs and raises WENDY, who moans in pain as she starts being pushed around.

WENDY: Ow! Ow! Ah! Jesus!

JESSICA: You are going to sign these papers or -

WENDY: Or what? I'm not afraid of you.

JESSICA: Do you know what shame feels like, Wendy?

WENDY: Of course.

Wendy pants as Jessica keeps pushing her towards the train tracks.

JESSICA: No, I mean real shame, Wendy. You know, when you've done something... You've hurt, disgusted someone so completely... that you can see it in their eyes. (Jessica dangles Wendy over the track. She yelps.). The black, oozing shit inside you. You sweat it through your skin but it keeps spreading... until you would do anything... (The headlight of an approaching train appears)... not to feel it. Anything.

WENDY: You're crazy.

JESSICA:   Sign the papers or I'll drop -
She accidentally drops Wendy.

JESSICA: Shit! I didn't mean to do that.

The train horn is heard blaring. As it approaches, Jessica jumps on the track, grabs Wendy, throws her on the other side of the track, waits for the train to get close, and as the vehicle starts breaking she leaps back to where she was. Wendy sees Jessica through the passing train, until Jessica isn’t there anymore.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
The elevator rings ands it opens. Jessica is inside, spread on the floor. Malcolm is outside, wearing running shorts.

MALCOLM: Well, how long have you been here?

JESSICA: Jazzercise?

Malcolm helps Jessica get up and leads her through the corridor.

MALCOLM: Running actually helps with sobriety.

JESSICA:  Sobriety blows.

MALCOLM: You're a real inspiration.

Malcolm takes out the hairband, then opens the door to Jessica’s apartment.

MALCOLM: Oh, careful.

Malcolm takes a brick out of the way and leaves Jessica to enter the kitchen. Jessica takes off her jacket and starts removing the boots.

MALCOLM: What you need is some electrolytes, something solid in your stomach.

Malcolm takes a bite out of some meatloaf in the table and opens the cabinets. Jessica takes off the gloves, and walks to her room while removing the blouse. She crashes in bed, and then notices blood on the sheets. Looking to the other side of the bed, Ruben is there with his throat slit. Jessica gasps, gets up scared, pushes herself towards the wall and starts sliding down. She looks at her hands, covered in Ruben’s blood. Malcolm enters the room. Eventually his jaw drops and he lets the glass in his hand fall.

MALCOLM: Jesus Christ! Holy Jesus Christ! He's dead. That's... That's his dead body. That's Ruben.

Jessica gets up and notices bloody footprints on the carpet.

JESSICA: Kilgrave. He was here. He made Ruben...

She covers her mouth with her hand.

MALCOLM: Oh, my God, poor Ruben. Oh, man, his poor sister. I just...

JESSICA: (Stammering) I can't. I can't do this. I can't. I can't keep fighting him. I can't fight him! I can't do this!

MALCOLM: Hey, hey. (He grabs Jessica’s shoulders). Hey, look at me. You have not killed anyone, all right? Right? Just breathe.

JESSICA: This has to stop.

MALCOLM: Yeah, you're right. You know what? We're gonna make it stop. I'm gonna call the police right now and we're gonna make it stop.

JESSICA: They'll arrest me.

Malcolm dials 911.

MALCOLM: You didn't do it and the evidence will confirm that.

JESSICA: This is the third death that I'm directly connected to.

Without responding, Malcolm hangs up. Jessica closes Ruben's eyes.

JESSICA: I'm so sorry, Ruben.

Malcolm approaches Jessica.

JESSICA: I'm gonna end it.

MALCOLM: End what? Yourself?

JESSICA: There's another option. I go to jail.

MALCOLM: What? No!

JESSICA: But it has to be the right jail.

Jessica walks out of the room. Malcolm follows. Cut to Jessica’s computer. She’s researching supermax prisons.

MALCOLM: Why the hell would you wanna be locked up there?

JESSICA: Because supermax prison is a hi-tech mousetrap, and I'll be the bait when Kilgrave comes for me.

MALCOLM: If he comes for you.

JESSICA: He'll come! I know him.

MALCOLM:  Or he will just send somebody.

JESSICA:  He can't compel someone through seven layers of security. He'll have to come himself, use his powers, which will be recorded on security cameras that he can't erase.

MALCOLM: Or you spend the rest of your life locked up with a bunch of murderers.

JESSICA: I need proof, Malcolm. And this could expose him.

MALCOLM: Unbelievable.

JESSICA: And there's a detective... What is his name? He questioned me about the Shlottman murders. He's already suspicious.

Jessica grabs her cellphone and calls a number.

WOMAN: 15th Precinct.

JESSICA: Homicide, please.

MALCOLM: No, stop!

Jessica pushes Malcolm away.

OFFICER: Homicide.

JESSICA: Hi, can I speak to the lead detective on the Shlottman murders?

OFFICER: Uh, Clemons?

JESSICA: Clemons, right. Can I speak with him?

OFFICER: Can I help you?

JESSICA: No, it has to be him. What time is he on duty?

OFFICER: 8:00 p.m.

JESSICA: 8:00 p.m. I'll be there.

Jessica turns off the phone.

MALCOLM: Okay. 8:00 p.m. This is good, right? It gives us time to think, you know, about what's the potential fall-out? Who else is vulnerable?

JESSICA:  I need a lawyer.

She gets up and starts walking away.

MALCOLM: Okay, good.

Jessica gets her jacket from a chair and starts putting it on as she walks out of the apartment.

MALCOLM: I'm gonna stay here with Ruben.

JESSICA: No, you have to disappear.

MALCOLM: Look, I'm in this now, Jessica.

JESSICA: No, I don't want you in this!

MALCOLM: And I don't want you in this either.

JESSICA: I can't protect you anymore. If you don't believe me, ask Ruben. I only have until 8:00 p.m. to tie up loose ends.

CUT TO: TRISH'S APARTMENT
A taxi drives by. A cell phone ring is heard, two pairs of hands are shown, and then it’s revealed that Simpson and Trish are having sex in her bedroom. After both climax, they start laughing.

SIMPSON: That was, uh, intense.

TRISH: Don't talk.

She laughs.

SIMPSON:  Whatever you say, boss.

The phone rings again. Trish checks who’s calling and rejects it.

SIMPSON: You know, you answer it, they'll stop calling.

TRISH: No, she won't.

SIMPSON: She?

TRISH: It's Jessica.

SIMPSON: What, you're dodging her calls?

TRISH: She'll just... try and convince me that it wasn't my fault. The van, losing Kilgrave.

SIMPSON:  Ah. Well, she's right. That's on her.

TRISH: Don't say that. Doesn't matter. I am not calling her until I have something to tell her.

SIMPSON: About?

TRISH: I'm, uh... I'm starving. Udon noodle salad?

Trish starts walking towards the kitchen.

SIMPSON: Oh, wow! You just blew past that question. What's going on, Trish?

Trish gets something from the fridge.

SIMPSON: Trish, what are you up to?

TRISH: I'd rather not say.

SIMPSON: Well, if it involves Kilgrave...

TRISH: Well, not yet.

SIMPSON: Oh, shit. It does?

TRISH: Calm down. I'm not gonna go anywhere near him.

SIMPSON: Which implies that you know where he is.

TRISH: I don't. I might have a lead.

SIMPSON: So, you gonna tell me?

Trish walks past Simpson, gets an envelope on the table behind them, and passes to him. He opens it. Inside are the pictures of various people in black shirts.

SIMPSON: Mmm, military.

TRISH: Ex. They're bodyguards. Kilgrave's new bodyguards.

SIMPSON: And how do you know?

TRISH: I went to all the top New York security firms, told them an old stalker of mine was back, that I was in the market for a new protection detail. After that, it was just a matter of getting the right people to talk.

SIMPSON: No way. The first rule of personal security is to keep your clients secret.

TRISH: I give good talk.

SIMPSON: Oh, clearly. So, we follow these guys, maybe they lead us to Kilgrave.

TRISH: We stake him out. Call in Jess, she tosses him in that hermetically sealed room you set up.

SIMPSON: Oh, Trish... some people need to be removed from this Earth, and Kilgrave is one of 'em.

TRISH: We don't get to decide that. Killers decide that. That's what makes them killers.

SIMPSON: That is naive.

TRISH: And idealistic, and futile, but I want justice for my friend. For that girl in prison. For you and me. I want Kilgrave to live long and alone and despised until he wants to die, but can't. Because that's justice, and I'll fight like hell for it.

SIMPSON: Wow. You just need a flag and a horse.

TRISH: I'd look goddamn good on it.

SIMPSON: Mhm.

CUT TO: COURTHOUSE
Jessica is sitting in the staircase outside the courthouse. Hogarth and Pam arrive. Jessica gets up.

HOGARTH: I need you to be ready with every exhibit.

PAM: I know.

HOGARTH: It will be rapid fire. Any pauses will kill my rhythm.

PAM: I am organized and caffeinated to the hilt.

JESSICA: I need a lawyer.

PAM: You scared me.

HOGARTH: How did you know we were here?

JESSICA: The temp.

HOGARTH: Fire the temp.

JESSICA: I need a lawyer.

HOGARTH:  I'm about to try a case. Yes, Jessica, I have cases other than Hope's. This one is precedent-setting.

JESSICA:  Defending some guilty, rich asshole for fraud?

PAM: It's not Jeri's job to determine guilt or innocence.

HOGARTH: Jessica, I don't have time for distractions right now.

JESSICA: Then you'll be happy to know that I served your ex the divorce papers last night.

HOGARTH: Did Wendy sign?

JESSICA: She'll sign.

PAM: Did she say that?

JESSICA: She'll sign.

HOGARTH: When?

JESSICA: I need... a lawyer.

HOGARTH: Pam, could you go inside and set up, please? I'll be right there.

PAM: Yeah.

HOGARTH: Did you do something to Wendy?

JESSICA: Yeah, I scared the shit out of her, per your request.

HOGARTH: I just want this done.

JESSICA: Yeah, I know the feeling. Now... what do I have to do to get locked up in supermax by nightfall?

HOGARTH: Are you telling me that you're planning to commit a crime? Because I would be obligated to report that.

JESSICA: What would it take?

HOGARTH: All right. Supermax only houses the worst criminals. Top-shelf perverts, cannibals, serial killers who make mosaics with their victims' fingernails.

JESSICA:  Well, that's... very specific.

HOGARTH: It's a living hell... with real demons. It is the last place you wanna end up.

JESSICA: Be at the 15th Precinct at 8:00 p.m.

HOGARTH: I'm a defense lawyer. I keep people out of jail.

JESSICA: Not today.

HOGARTH: What're you gonna do?

Jessica puts on sunglasses and walks away.

JESSICA: It's already done.

CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Shot of Ruben’s body. Malcolm comes inside and checks on the body.

MALCOLM: I can't believe I'm doing this.

Malcolm leaves and locks the door. Robyn comes in at the end of the hallway.

ROBYN: Hey, that's not your apartment!

MALCOLM: Uh, yeah, I was borrowing a, um... toothpaste.

ROBYN: Can't lie to me, string bean. I got a bullshit meter the size of west Texas. You weren't getting a toothpaste, were you? Tell the truth.

MALCOLM: No. I wasn't getting... toothpaste. I was looking for booze.

ROBYN: Human lie detector, (She touches her chest), right here! I can always tell.

MALCOLM:  Right, well, I, uh... I didn't take any.

ROBYN: Addicts, man! You are so sneaky. Let me smell your breath. (She approaches Malcolm and inhales). Glad the demons didn't get the better of you, Q-Tip. You know, I think Jones is hiding something about my brother.

MALCOLM: No, I don't think so.

ROBYN: He's been drawing their initials with a big heart around 'em on his Etch-a-Sketch. Something's going on.

MALCOLM: It is. They're involved.

ROBYN: She is a sexual predator! He's just a boy!

MALCOLM: In his 20s.

ROBYN: Thank you, Malcolm, for telling me the truth. I just can't handle the lies.

Robyn starts walking away.

MALCOLM: Robyn, wait. There's something else.

ROBYN: Yeah?

MALCOLM: Jessica's not a bad person. You have to know that.

ROBYN:  I don't know what kind of spell that harpy puts on men, but you have to stop doing her bidding. You're better than that. I can always tell.

Robyn walks away. Malcolm fiddles with Jessica’s keys and leaves.
CUT TO: LUKE'S BAR
Jessica enters, taking off her sunglasses, and starts checking behind the counter.

JESSICA: Hello?

Roy enters, carrying a beer crate.

ROY: Looking for Luke? He took some time off. Went away for a while.

JESSICA: Good. Good for him. I just wanted to tell him -

ROY: You just wanted to tell him you love him, you want him back, you're gonna have his baby.

JESSICA: What? No.

ROY: Heard it before. Best move on. He won't miss you. The only one he ever missed is in the ground.

JESSICA: Tell him the right people are gonna pay for what's been done. And tell him I don't expect him to forgive me.

ROY: You know what happens when you burn a bridge? You gotta learn to swim, or fly.

Roy laughs. Jessica leaves.
CUT TO: HOGARTH'S OFFICE
Wendy enters.

HOGARTH: For the love of God, Wendy.

WENDY:  I wanted to hand-deliver this to you.

Wendy hands her some papers.

HOGARTH: The divorce papers.

Hogarth take the papers out of the envelope and starts reading them. Just as Wendy turns her back, Pam walks in.

WENDY: You're so... beautiful. And naive. You probably don't deserve this.

PAM:Deserve what?

HOGARTH: What is this?

WENDY: Printouts of our old e-mail correspondence. Still have that AOL account. Subject line “Seven,” meaning juror number seven in Jeri's first capital case. I'm guessing she didn't tell you about bribing him.

HOGARTH: You're blackmailing me?

WENDY: You threaten my life, I threaten your career. Which is more important to her than her life... or anyone else's.

HOGARTH: I did not threaten you.

WENDY: You sent your freakish thug. You made me afraid. It was sickening. So, I am protecting myself.

HOGARTH: Get out, or I will call security.

WENDY: And I'll call the New York Bar Association. Fair warning, she lies. It's second nature to her.

PAM: Jeri never lied to me. She told me about this when we first got together.

WENDY: 75% of your assets, or you'll lose it all.

Wendy leaves, slamming the door.

HOGARTH: Thank you.

PAM: It's difficult to defend you when she knows more of your secrets than I do.

CUT TO: TALENT AGENCY
Jessica approaches a building with a plaque reading, "Stars & Tykes Talent Agency - 2nd Floor". The door opens. A girl and her mother leave. Jessica stares at them with a condescending look before entering through the open door. A bunch of girls, each accompanied by a parent, are rehearsing a line.

GIRL: I love Za Cola 'cause it tastes great.

Jessica enters the room after climbing the stairs. She sits besides a woman spraying her daughter's hair.

MOTHER: Stop fidgeting.

The girl whines. A woman wearing glasses comes in from an adjacent room holding a photo.

DOROTHY: Britney Kovak.

The girl being sprayed gets up. Dorothy takes off her glasses, but then changes her expression as she sees Jessica.

DOROTHY: Jessie. Come in.

Jessica gets up.

MOTHER: Our appointment was 30 minutes ago!

DOROTHY: Welcome to showbiz.

Cut to Dorothy's office. A framed poster of It's Patsy signed, "Thanks Mom," hangs from the wall. Dorothy and Jessica enter.

DOROTHY: You look terrific, Jessie.

JESSICA: You look done. How much of Trish's money did that cost you?

DOROTHY: Old age, honey. Start saving now. So, to what do I owe the pleasure?

JESSICA: It's about Trish.

DOROTHY:Why? What's happened? Is she on drugs again?

JESSICA: She hasn't touched drugs since I dragged her away from you.

DOROTHY: I had no idea that doctor was over-prescribing.

JESSICA: Still no responsibility or remorse. I wish I could be like that.

DOROTHY: “No responsibility,” hmm? I took you in. You were an orphan. That's gotta count for something.

JESSICA: You don't get credit for doing the right thing for the wrong reasons.

DOROTHY: I cared about -

JESSICA: About publicity. I was a strategic play to further the Patsy Walker brand. Trish is fine. She has security like Fort Knox and she's savvy enough not to let anyone sneak up on her, except you. She has no defenses against you.

DOROTHY: She doesn't need defenses. I'm her mother.

JESSICA: You're her pimp!

DOROTHY: I haven't seen her in three years.

JESSICA: Except for when you accidentally ran into her?

DOROTHY: It's a small city.

JESSICA: And leave long, drunken messages for her?

DOROTHY: What is it you want from me?

JESSICA: I want you to stick to the agreement. Because no matter where I am, even if I'm behind bars, if you try anything, I will find out. I will come for you, and it will hurt.

DOROTHY: People can change, Jessie.

JESSICA: It doesn't make the bad shit you did go away.

DOROTHY: I just... had a problem. I got help.

JESSICA: And royalty checks.

DOROTHY: I earned those!

JESSICA: If you want them to keep coming, you'll respect TRISH's wishes... which I will enforce.

DOROTHY: "And it will hurt.” You need a better tagline.

JESSICA: Five hundred feet. Just like a real restraining order. Five hundred feet away from her. Do you understand?

DOROTHY: Yes. Taking you in was the worst decision of my life.

JESSICA: Thanks, Mom.

Jessica leaves.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Trish is in an elevator, talking to Simpson on her phone.

SIMPSON: Trish, what's going on?

TRISH: Any sign of Kilgrave?

Cut to Simpson in his car.

SIMPSON: Not yet. I'm still following his security detail. I've been tailing them all over the city, but...

Simpson is parked outside of Jessica's old house. It's surrounded by security, despite the only people around being handymen.

SIMPSON: ...it doesn't look like they're up to too much. You sure these are Kilgrave's guys? You could have bad intel.

Kilgrave is seen in the driveway, guiding some people who are carrying furniture.

TRISH: It's the only intel we have. So we let it play out. Call me the second you get eyes on him.

SIMPSON: Yes, ma'am.

Trish approaches Jessica's apartment and knocks on the door. Malcolm opens it.

TRISH: Where's Jessica?

MALCOLM: Thanks for coming. Come in.

TRISH: My assistant thought you were a stalker. You called ten times.

MALCOLM: You haven't told Jessica, right?

TRISH: You're shaking and sweating. Are you high?

MALCOLM: Ugh, Trish, look, something has happened. And now Jessica is in trouble.

TRISH: What did she do?

MALCOLM:Nothing. That's the problem, she hasn't done anything wrong. Look, she is about to make a huge mistake, and I am not gonna let her.

TRISH: Okay, let's hear it.

MALCOLM: Okay, I am... I'm gonna show you something really, really bad. But you can't freak out.

TRISH: I'm not gonna freak out.

MALCOLM: Promise?

TRISH: Just show me.

Malcolm leads her to the bedroom.

MALCOLM: You cannot scream.

TRISH: I'm not gonna scream.

The door is open, revealing Ruben's corpse in bed. Trish screams.

TRISH: Oh, my God!

MALCOLM: You said you wouldn't scream.

Trish takes a gun out of her purse and points it at Malcolm.

MALCOLM: Hey. Hey.

TRISH: What did you do?

MALCOLM: Hey, whoa! Now, just keep your voice down.

TRISH: What the hell happened?

MALCOLM: Kilgrave, all right? But what matters now is what's going to happen at 8:00 p.m. tonight. I need... (Trish cocks the gun)... Jessica needs your help.

CUT TO: BUSY STREET
Jessica is in the back seat of a cab.

JESSICA: Pull over.

DRIVER: I can't pull over.

JESSICA: Come on, man.

DRIVER: You wanna get killed crossing here?

JESSICA: I've got 56 minutes of freedom left. I'll take my chances.

She hands the driver some money and gets out of the car. She checks the Manhattan Bridge above, and walks into a security tunnel. Eventually she comes to a maintenance door, which she breaks open. She climbs the ladder inside, and comes out on top of one of the bridge's towers. She stands by the railing and narrates as shots of NYC are shown.

JESSICA: (Narrating) I hate goodbyes. I've always just disappeared. But this goodbye... this one deserves a last, lingering look.

CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica returns home. As she enters the apartment, an angry Trish is inside.

JESSICA: I've been calling you.

TRISH: I know. I was waiting to tell you something, but...

JESSICA: How did you get in?

TRISH: Malcolm. You gave him a key.

JESSICA: Where is he?

TRISH: Saving you from yourself.

Jessica walks away and enters the bedroom. The room is clean, and the bed has neither the sheets nor the corpse from before.

JESSICA: What the hell did you do?

TRISH: You've lost it, Jess. And I get it. I really do. But you're not thinking clearly.

JESSICA: You don't know what you're talking about.

TRISH: I think I do, given the amount of blood I just cleaned up. You wanna get yourself put away for it.

JESSICA: I have a plan.

TRISH: You have guilt and shame and it is clouding your judgment.

JESSICA: A complex plan.

TRISH: A bad plan.

JESSICA: Yes, it is a terrible plan and it is a complete long shot. But it's the only plan I've got.

TRISH: You can't do anything in prison. You can't save Hope. You can't protect anyone or yourself.

JESSICA: Where the hell is the body?

TRISH: I know how to find Kilgrave. I have a lead. I was waiting to tell you until -

JESSICA: You are looking for him?

TRISH: Simpson is. I found Kilgrave's new security team.

JESSICA: No. You tell Simpson to back off. He's gonna get himself killed.

TRISH: He'll call us in when he finds Kilgrave, just let us handle it until -

JESSICA: Until what? Until I come home and find my landlady choked out in my bathtub? Or I find you bludgeoned to death with my vacuum cleaner?

TRISH: We both know you don't own a vacuum cleaner. I won't let you go to prison. You're not a murderer.

JESSICA: Yes, I am.

TRISH: You're still punishing yourself for that woman's death?

JESSICA: And now more people are dead. Hope Shlottman's parents, Ruben, Reva, and someone has to give their families closure. And until the real killer shows up, that's gonna be me. I have to pay.

TRISH: There are so many ways this could go wrong.

JESSICA: There's one way it'll go right. No one else will die because of me. I'm taking myself out of the equation. I'm still not the hero that you wanted me to be.

TRISH: You're exactly the hero I wanted you to be.

JESSICA: Tell me where Ruben is.

CUT TO: DOCK
Malcolm is dragging Ruben's body wrapped in the sheets. He puts concrete bricks on top of the corpse and ties them, and then lifts the sheet to see Ruben's face once more time.

MALCOLM: (Speaking French) A beautiful funeral doesn't guarantee Heaven.

Malcolm pushes the body into the river.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S CHILDHOOD HOME
Kilgrave is approached by a worker carrying a Mickey Mouse statue.

MAN: Look at this, boss. Just like the picture. Lucked out on eBay.

KILGRAVE: Put it in the bedroom. Nice work.

As the moving crew continues, Kilgrave enters a car and drives by Simpson. Simpson's phone vibrates, and it's shown Trish has sent three texts: "Call me," "Call ASAP," and "Where r u?"
CUT TO: DOCK
Jessica approaches Malcolm.

JESSICA: Malcolm!

MALCOLM: She told you.

JESSICA: Where is he?

MALCOLM: Look, a coroner will see that the wounds are self-inflicted.

JESSICA: Hold this. (She gives him her phone). I'll take care of it. (She takes off her jacket and boots). You are done with this.

She jumps into the river.
CUT TO: POLICE STATION
A soaking wet Jessica walks in carrying a plastic bag, passing by Sgt. Mahoney. She approaches Detective Clemons's desk as he fills out paperwork.

CLEMONS: Yes. You'll have to wait. Someone will be with you in a minute. Someone with yellow sneakers...

Jessica empties the bag, dropping Ruben's head on the desk.

CLEMONS: Oh, sh...

Everyone gasps.

JESSICA: I've done something terrible.

Cut to an interrogation room, where Jessica is handcuffed.

JESSICA: God damn it! What is taking so long?

The door opens. Clemons and Hogarth enter.

JESSICA: I told you 8:00 p.m. You're late.

HOGARTH: You actually did it.

JESSICA: Yes, I did.

HOGARTH: You have gone off the deep end.

JESSICA: What?

HOGARTH: I want her to have a psych eval. We'll be pleading mental incompetence.

JESSICA: I told you I need to go to supermax! I need to be in supermax. I belong there.

HOGARTH: And I told you that I'm a defense attorney who does not lose cases.

JESSICA: Oh, so you're protecting your reputation?

HOGARTH: Wendy told me what you did. Excuse me, she screamed what you did. Your judgment is severely impaired.

JESSICA: I waive my right to counsel.

HOGARTH: No, she does not understand what she's talking about. She doesn't understand her situation.

JESSICA: I am fully cognizant of my situation. This woman does not represent me.

CLEMONS: I can get you a public defender.

JESSICA: I'll be representing myself in this. We've already wasted enough time.

HOGARTH: For God's sake, let me do my job!

CLEMONS: It seems like you no longer have a job, Miss Hogarth. You should leave.

HOGARTH: You still owe me a favor, God damn it.

JESSICA:Collect it from prison.

Hogarth leaves.

JESSICA: Jesus Christ, Clemons. I brought you my victim's head, and now I'm confessing. Open and shut.

CLEMONS: Is it?

JESSICA: I'm sick. I'm dangerous and I belong in supermax.

CLEMONS: Supermax? Not jail?

JESSICA: I'm a top-shelf pervert.

CLEMONS: Last time we talked, you were just trying to make a goddamn living.

JESSICA: Last time we talked, you were suspicious of me. You thought that I was hiding something and you were right. And now I'm tired of hiding.

CLEMONS: So you've come to me to...?

JESSICA: Expedite my incarceration. I just want... to rest. Clemons, you're two years away from retiring. Call this an easy collar and just put me away.

Clemons sighs and sits down.

CLEMONS: Why'd you kill him?

JESSICA: Because that's what I do. I'm a killer... and a sociopath.

CLEMONS: You never killed before?

JESSICA: I've never been caught.

CLEMONS: Who else have you killed?

JESSICA: A year ago I punched a woman so hard in the chest that her heart stopped.

CLEMONS: Why?

JESSICA: I didn't mean to.

CLEMONS: You beat a woman to death by accident?

JESSICA: There is a power inside me... and it just takes over. Supermax is the only place strong enough to hold me.

CLEMONS: That guy's head?

JESSICA: I tore it off with my bare hands.

CLEMONS: That takes a lot of strength. And a hacksaw.

JESSICA: Unbelievable.

She gets up.

CLEMONS: Miss Jones, sit down!

Jessica breaks the chain holding her handcuffs to the table and grabs the chair she was sitting on.

JESSICA: You are wasting time!

She bends the chair and throws it at the wall.

JESSICA: Put me in supermax.

CLEMONS: Stop!

Mahoney enters.

MAHONEY: Jessica Jones? You're free to go.

CLEMONS: Mahoney, what are you doing?

Mahoney opens Jessica's handcuffs.

MAHONEY: Captain's orders. Go, now.

JESSICA: I told you Hogarth does not represent me. And I'm gonna kick her Armani-covered ass!

Jessica walks down the precinct's corridor.

JESSICA: HOGARTH! I told you to -

When Jessica arrives at the office, the cops are all either  holding guns to their own heads, or pointing them at other people. Clemons arrives soon after her.

CLEMONS: What the hell is going on here? Drop your weapons!

Mahoney gets behind Clemons and cocks his gun as he points it at Clemons.

CLEMONS: Brett?

MAHONEY: Shut up. Don't move.

KILGRAVE: Oh, everyone, calm down, you're killing the mood.

He gets up from a desk and walks over to Jessica.

KILGRAVE: Jessica. You're not surprised to see me. You had to know I'd come for you. Not this fast? I... I will admit to keeping eyes on you. Spies are easy to come by, for me.

JESSICA: Do whatever you're going to do to me, but let them go.

KILGRAVE: Well, I have to protect myself, so...

JESSICA: Then control me, not them.

KILGRAVE: I have absolutely no intention of controlling you. I want you to act on your own accord.

JESSICA: Act how? Suicide? Is that why you've been torturing me?

KILGRAVE: Oh, my God. Jessica, I knew you were insecure. That's just sad. I'm not torturing you. Why would I? I love you.

JESSICA: You have been ruining... my life.

KILGRAVE: You didn't have a life.

JESSICA: As a demented declaration of love?

KILGRAVE: No, obviously. I... I was trying... to show you what I see. That I'm the only one who matches you. Who challenges you. Who'll do anything for you.

JESSICA: This is a sick joke. You have killed innocent people.

KILGRAVE: Oh, well, that... That milquetoast little man-boy? He interrupted me while I was leaving you a present, which, apparently, you didn't even find. Come on! You cannot pretend he didn't irritate you, too. I wanted to slap him after 30 seconds. I know. I realize this will take time. But I'm gonna prove it to you.

A phone rings.

KILGRAVE: Whose is that? Whose phone is that?

Kilgrave finds the phone in Clemons's jacket. He throws it over the detective's head.

KILGRAVE:  Next person whose phone rings has to eat it! Crappy fluorescent lights and cockroaches and loud cell phones and the smell of piss. I am trying to profess eternal love here, people!

JESSICA: I'll come with you.

KILGRAVE: To protect them. Not out of choice.

JESSICA: You know me well. We can work out the rest.

KILGRAVE: Oh, please! I am new to love, but I know what it looks like. I do watch television.

JESSICA: You deranged prick. You've never loved anyone in your repulsive life.

KILGRAVE: Do not presume to know! Before I met you, I got... everything I wanted. And I didn't realize... how unsatisfactory that was, until you left me to die. You are the first thing, excuse me, person... I ever wanted that walked away from me. You made me feel something I had never felt before. Yearning. I actually missed you.

JESSICA: Well, I'm here now. You've got me.

KILGRAVE: No, I don't. I'm hoping you'll choose me just like I've chosen you. I believe you will figure out the same thing I did. That we're inevitable.

Jessica scoffs. Kilgrave approaches a cop who is pointing his gun to someone at a computer.

KILGRAVE: Is it all gone?

COP: Almost done.

It's shown that recent surveillance camera footage is being erased.

KILGRAVE: I can't erase memories, but I can erase security footage. All evidence that you and I were ever here has been deleted.

Kilgrave grabs the plastic bag and chuckles softly as he sees its contents.

KILGRAVE: Manual decapitation. You... You're full of surprises. In 30 seconds, you'll all realize this was a hilarious joke, and you'll let Jessica Jones leave. Look for my present. And when you are ready... I'll see you at home.

After Kilgrave leaves with the bag, everyone starts laughing and dropping the guns. Jessica leaves in disbelief.
CUT TO: JESSICA'S APARTMENT
Jessica rushes to her apartment and starts searching for something. Eventually she notices a briefcase. She has a flashback. Kilgrave opens the same case she found in her apartment. Inside is a yellow paper. The flashback ends. Jessica approaches the case and opens it. Inside is a notebook with a blue Post-It reading, "Start at the beginning". She opens the book, and the first page reads "Property of: JESSICA JONES 1996-1999". After flipping through the pages, Jessica gets up. Some time later, Jessica is packing her bags, putting the diary inside. As she opens the door to the hallway, she sees Robyn.

ROBYN: You know where he is... don't you?

Robyn enters the apartment and starts looking around.

JESSICA: I can't help you. You have to leave.

ROBYN: Malcolm told me everything.

JESSICA: What did he tell you?

ROBYN: Oh, I'm sure Ruben is probably just a distraction to you.

Robyn finds Ruben's sandal in a trash can.

ROBYN: You know he's just acting out against me. Tell him I'm sorry about the zoo. We can go this weekend. Will you tell him? I'll take him to see the giraffes. I promise. He loves those long necks. He's very sensitive about his neck, you know? You should know that. Also, he won't eat crust if it has seeds on it.

JESSICA: Ruben's not coming back.

ROBYN: Where did he go? He can't take care of himself!

Robyn sobs, holding Ruben's sandal. Jessica tries to put her hand on Robyn's shoulder, but Robyn turns away.

ROBYN: This is all your fault. We were fine before you came here. No. Wait, don't go. Wait, you're a P.I., right? You can find him! I have money, please!

Jessica leaves. Robyn punches a wall.

ROBYN:  Ruben!

CUT TO: TAXI
Jessica is in a taxi, holding the diary. The taxi passes by the "Higgins Drive/Birch Street" sign. Once the taxi gets to her old house, she gets out and begins to have a flashback. A Mercedes-Benz is parked with a young Trish in the passenger seat. Dorothy and a young Jessica approach the car.

DOROTHY: Jessica, I told you, we're not wasting any more time looking for it.

JESSICA: It's under one of the floorboards. I just can't remember which one.

DOROTHY: Well, that wasn't very smart, was it? We'll buy you a new journal. Did you hear me?

JESSICA: Yeah.

DOROTHY: I believe what you meant to say was, “Yes, thank you, Ms. Walker.” You're gonna live with us now. We use proper etiquette.

DOROTHY opens the back door. Jessica enters and sits. She looks at the neck injuries of Trish, who's in the passenger seat. Trish covers her neck with a scarf.

TRISH: Don't you know it's rude to stare at people?

The engine starts. The flashback ends. Kilgrave comes out of the front door. Jessica approaches him. As both go towards the house, a puzzled Simpson is shown watching. Kilgrave opens the door and Jessica enters.
