I`d give my life I could hold you
I`m losing sound when I should love you
You are my sun where there`s no light
Make it rise, alright

Told you
I`d give my life I could hold you
I`m losing sound when I should love you
You are my sun where there`s no light
Bring your sunrise next to mine

Impossible to reach I can run no more
I find is not so hard to let you go
I got reasons to live `cause I`m natural high
From sunrise delight

I got reasons to live all the time
Everyday smiling up to the sky
No more rain, no more pain in my life
Never down `cause I am a natural high

A natural high x2
Live it up

Next to mine
Bring your sunrise next to mine
Yeah right
Next to mine
`Cause I`m natural, natural high

I`d give my life I could hold you
I`m losing sound when I should love you
You are my sun where there`s no light
Make it rise, alright

Told you
I`d give my life I could hold you
I`m losing sound when I should love you
You are my sun where there`s no light
Bring your sunrise next to mine

Bring your sunrise next to mine x2

I got reasons to live all the time
Everyday smiling up to the sky
No more rain, no more pain in my life
Never down `cause I am a natural h√Øgh
