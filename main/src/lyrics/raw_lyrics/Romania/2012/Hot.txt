Fly like you do it, like you're high
Like you do it, like you fly
Let me do it like a woman
Fly like you do it, like you're hot
Like you do it, like you try
Let me do it like a woman

[Interlude: Play & Win]
(Go!)

[Verse: Inna]
You belong to me, I belong to you
Fire from my heart, burning just for you
When you're far away, I'm in love with you
Feelings are so high, what can I do?
You belong to me, I belong to you
Fire from my heart, burning just for you
When you're far away, I'm in love with you
Feelings are so high, what can I do?
What can I do?

[Chorus: Inna]
Fly like you do it, like you're high
Like you do it, like you fly
Let me do it like a woman
Fly like you do it, like you're hot
Like you do it, like you try
Let me do it like a woman
