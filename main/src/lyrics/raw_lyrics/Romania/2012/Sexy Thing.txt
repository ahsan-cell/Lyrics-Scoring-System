I guess you see that I should be
The one you need feel the electricity
'Cause your so right dancing tonight
You blow my mind, you've got to be my sexy thing

[Chorus]
Somebody told you
How much I love you
How much I love you
How much I love you
Somebody told you
How much I love you
How much I love you
How much I love you

You blow my mind, you've got to be my sexy thing
