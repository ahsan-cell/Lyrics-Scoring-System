Come with me into the journey of your life
I′ll be your secret ride
I will make you dream with opened eyes (Opened eyes ieehee)
I wanna make you try
Show me love and all the things you hide inside (Live it up)
We gonna ride them all
Just forget the troubles in your life
Just forget the problems of your life

Leave about the time
Walk away and smile
Just try (Just try)
You got to show mе love
Free just like a bird
And fly (And fly)

Everywhеre I go, all around the world
I take you by my side on my secret ride
Everywhere I go, all around the world
I take you by my side on the journey of your life

(Live it up ... live it up ... live it up ...)

I wanna see you high
Come with me into the journey of your life
I'll be your secret ride
I will make you dream with opened eyes (Opened eyes ieehee)
I wanna make you try
Show me love and all the things you hide inside (Live it up)
We gonna ride them all
Just forget the troubles in your life
Just forget the problems of your life
