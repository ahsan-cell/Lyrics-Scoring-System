You gotta show me what is wrong or right
Because I never felt this way before
I wanna feel you now in my life
In my life, get a life

Get a life, get a life
Why don't you take my life
Take my life, take my life

You have to get a life
Get a life, get a life
Why don't you take my life
Take my life, take my life
