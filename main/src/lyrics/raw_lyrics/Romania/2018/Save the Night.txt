Since the weather is so blue
I've been dreaming about you
I've been dreaming about
How to save the night, with you

You give the night, night
Oh yeah
You give the night, night
Oh yeah

Since the weather is so blue
I've been dreaming about you

Oh love is a waterfall making it beautiful
I feel the waterfall making it beautiful
So babyâ€¦

[Chorus]
You give the night, night
Oh yeah
You give the night, night
