I keep your smile in my heart
Nothing can tear us apart
I've been searching for you all this time
Keep your eyes on my lips
'Cause it's them what you miss
I'll be there when you need my love

[Pre-Chorus]
I need tonight
Your love, your love, your love, your love by my side
'Cause I'll be waiting for your sweet love tonight
Your love, your love, your love, your love by my side
'Cause I'll be waiting for your love

[Chorus]
Let's fly away together
Let's get this dream forever
Let's dance like we're in heaven
Just give me your sweet love
Let's fly away together
Let's get this dream forever
Let's dance like we're in heaven
You know you're my sweet love
Let's fly away together

Let's dance like we're in heaven
Just give me your sweet love
Let's fly away together
Let's get this dream forever
Let's dance like we're in heaven
You know you're my sweet love
