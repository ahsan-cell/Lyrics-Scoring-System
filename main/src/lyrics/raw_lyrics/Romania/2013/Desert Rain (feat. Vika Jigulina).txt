I miss you so much, now I call again
Come, come tonight
Just hold me tight
From this desert rain, you're my guiding light

[Verse 1: Vika Jigulina]
We, we were lost this world of pain
I miss you so much now, I call again
Come, come tonight just hold me tight
From this desert rain, you're my guiding light

[Pre-Chorus: Vika Jigulina]
We, we were lost
This walk of time
We forgot about love, we forgot about us
Now I am here dreams become real

[Chorus: Edward Maya]
I feel like the sand that's blown away
Back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain

[Verse 1: Vika Jigulina]
We, we were lost this world of pain
I miss you so much, now I call again
Come, come tonight just hold me tight
From this desert rain you're my guiding light

We, we were lost this walk of time
We forgot about love, we forgot about us
Now I am here
Dreams become real

[Chorus: Edward Maya]
I feel like the sand that's blown away
Back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain

[Bridge: Edward Maya]
You will always have my soul
Hidden dreams and secret words
I'm missing you

[Chorus: Edward Maya]
I feel like the sand that's blown away
Back into the storm
I'm inside this dream
That feels just like a desert rain
