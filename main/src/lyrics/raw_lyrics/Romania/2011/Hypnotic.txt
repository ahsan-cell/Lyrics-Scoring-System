I can hear it when you call my name
And you whisper million miles away
Like a shooting rocket in the sky
If we touch, I feel that I can fly

Strofa 1:
Listen to
How loud my heart is beating just for you
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
I can't go living my life without you

Pre-refren:
Feel so good, happy day
We could pack our bags and keep on going
Go far away
Just one heart, just one soul

Bridge:
Your love, your love
Your love is so hypnotic
You're in control
I'm just on automatic
I need you now
I need you like an addict
Your love is so hypnotic, hypnotic

I really wanted you so desperately
I look at you now and I can't believe
You make it difficult for me to breathe
