Oh Mamma Mia
(Oh) He's Italiano
I love the way when I look in his eyes

[First Verse]
His name is Tony
He’s from Milano
He whisper's softly in my ears in Italiano
He never leaves me
'cause I’m his Cinderella~
He says that I'm his only one in Molta Bella!

[Pre-Chorus]
He follows everywhere I go and calls me "Baby"
His little gigolo has got me going CRAZY!!
I just can't get him off my mind he's so AMAZING!!
My heart says YES! My mind says NO!
Just let him go, go, go!

[Chorus]
Oh Mamma Mia
He's Italiano
He's gonna tell me I'm merely alive
Oh Mamma Mia
He's Italiano
I love the way when I look in his eyes
Oh Mamma Mia
(Mamma Mia ~ Mam Mamma Mia)
Mamma Mia!
(Mamma Mia)
Ay, Ay, Ay!
Mamma Mia!
(Mamma Mia ~ Mam Mamma Mia)
Mamma Mia!
(Mamma Mia!)
Ay, Ay, Ay!
