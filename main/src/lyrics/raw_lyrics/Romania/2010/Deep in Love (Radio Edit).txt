J. Warner, Tom Boxer, Morena
Let's go!

[Chorus: Morena]
You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way
There's nothing in this world that can take me from my girl
Let her heart screaming
Ooo ooooo
I could be falling for last
But that ain't goog enough

[Verse 1: Morena]
Baby, I'm falling for love love
I'm falling in love
Let’s go!
I'm from Venus, you're from Mars
When we’re together
We create stars
Falling down from Earth
Falling down from Earth
I'm from Venus, you're from Mars
When we're together
We create stars
Falling down from Earth
Falling down from Earth

You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way
You would make me fall in love
Deep in love
Find a way

J. Warner, Tom Boxer, Morena
Let's go!
There's nothing in this world that can take me from my girl
Let her heart screaming
Ooo ooooo
I could be falling for last
But that ain't goog enough
Baby, I'm falling for love love
I'm falling in love
From UK to LA
There's so many beautiful places
Hot beautiful faces
But only one stands out
Even though she's a little bit crazy
I love the challenge lady
She wants to see the whole world
I can't afford it
My own world
I love the sound of euro
I heard it caught enormous
I wanna buy you night night night?
You would make me fall in love

Deep in love
Find a way
