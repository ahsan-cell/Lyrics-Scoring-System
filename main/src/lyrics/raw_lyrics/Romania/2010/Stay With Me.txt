I remember the prison of all memories
And I’m drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me,  stay with me baby
When the lights go down

[Verse 1]
I was so crazy all the time I made you cry
You walked away and never said goodbye
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

I try to hide the pain but all I see is you
How can I do it, I don't have a clue
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

[Chorus]
I remember the prison of all memories
And I’m drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me,  stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I remember the voice that is calling my name
And I know that someday
You will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I was so crazy all the time I made you cry
You walked away and never said goodbye
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

I try to hide the pain but all I see is you
How can I do it, I don't have a clue
On and on, on and on
I guess I lost you, now you're gone

[Chorus]
I remember the prison of all memories
And I’m drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me,  stay with me baby
When the lights go down

I remember the voice that is calling my name
And I know that someday
You will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down

[Chorus]
I remember the prison of all memories
And I’m drowning in tears
Come and help me please
Stay with me,  stay with me baby
When the lights go down
I remember the voice that is calling my name
And I know that someday
You will feel the same
Stay with me, stay with me baby
When the lights go down
