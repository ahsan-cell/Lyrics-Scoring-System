I need you my love
I pray for your love

Amor mi amor
I need you my love
I call for you love

I couldn't believe
I wanted to live
'cause you loved me

Where ever you are
I am dream of your eyes
'cause they hit me

I used to be your air
Nothing more to share

Nothing more to share when you leave me

I got to let you know
I feel I wanna go
Take me so far away

Amor mi amor
I need you my love

Lover, I need you more than ever
I need you more 'n' more, mi amor

Love me on 'n' on
