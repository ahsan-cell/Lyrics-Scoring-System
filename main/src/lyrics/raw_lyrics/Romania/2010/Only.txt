If you leave me,i'll be fine,i'll be fine
This is not the end
If you leave me,í'll be fine,i'll be fine

~Refren~
Cause i'm only dreaming
Is just a feeling,in my world,in my world
Because i'm most lying
I feel like i'm dieing
In my world,in my world

Give me the sun rise

Give me the sun rise..
Give me the sun rise.yea
Give me the sun rise
Get up away
Give the smile
To bring me so much pain

~Refren~
Cause i'm only dreaming
Is just a feeling,in my world,in my world
Because i'm most lying
I feel like i'm dieing
In my world,ïn my world...You might also like
