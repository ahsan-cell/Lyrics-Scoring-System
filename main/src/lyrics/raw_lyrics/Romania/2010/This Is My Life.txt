I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming out loud
I'm searching the missing part of my heart

You catch me every time I fall

(When I look into your eyes)
(I just know you tell me lies)

[Hook]
This, this is my life
I'm looking for you, searching love in your eyes
This, this my life
I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night

[Verse 2]
Can you get to my soul
I'll make you lose the control
I'll be your sun in the night

Just come here inside
I'm playing with you
I'm falling for you

(When I look into your eyes)
(I just know you tell me lie)

This, this is my life
I'm looking for you, searching love in your eyes
This, this my life
I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night

[Verse 3]
I can't follow dreams forever
Just to see them fall apart
We can change the world if we are together
Cause I know I won't let it go

(When I look into your eyes)
(I just know you tell me lies)

[Hook]
This, this is my life
I'm looking for you, searching love in your eyes
This, this my life
I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night

[Bridge]
I start to miss your smile
Your voice is all I hear
I'm chasing hollow sighs
Show me I'm wrong tonight
[Hook]
This, this is my life
I'm looking for you, searching love in your eyes
This, this my life
I'm chasing a dream that fade away in the night1
