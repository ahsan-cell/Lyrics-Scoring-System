Coming to my life
Missing you now
Missing you so much

You're like a fire
Burning in my mind
Missing you now
Missing you so much

Missing you I am missing you
I miss you all the time
I need you now to look at me
Look at me tonight!
All the love you have for me
I see it in your eyes
It's all lies, lies, lies, lies

Oh love is all I need
Oh love will set me free
Oh you are on my mind
Oh no more lies to findYou might also like
