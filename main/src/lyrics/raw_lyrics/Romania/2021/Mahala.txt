Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never could
Smoke me inside you
Like I'm your sweetest drug and
Try to escape, but never had enough

Whoop!

Boom, bam, badam-bum, boom-bum-badam-bum
Boom, bam, badam-bum, boom-bum-badam-bum
Whoop!
Badam-bum, boom-bum-badam-bum
Boom, bam, badam-bum, boom-bum-badam-bum

[Verse: Misha Miller]
If you hear me singing
If you hear my soul
You'll never want
To let me go
Close your eyes and I will
Catch your flow inside
Your body's dancing
Wildest one
