Baby tell me the truth, you ain't really used to niggas loving you too
You ain't really used to niggas being this true
Yeah, you know I had to take a shot for you
Some niggas say they my dog, but ain't my dog
Sometimes hard to believe in myself how can I believe in y'all
My trust ain't shit with people, so I can't give you my all
But I gotta stay consistent, if I fall, we all fall

[Post-Chorus]
Had to make it up, had to make it up
All the things I did, had to make it up
All the time I missed, gotta make it up
All the shit that they done said, they done made that up

[Verse 1]
Sayin' fuck you, but every conversation with my niggas I keep bringing up you (Up you)
Damn, yeah, that shit had to be real
A good girl that's worth every dollar bill I earned
I [?] tried to set this dinner, baby, this ain't no happy meal
I brought you out so we can talk, baby, these problems gotta deal
Baby, let's keep it cautious and shit, gotta be deal, I mean gotta be dealt (Dealt)
Body language showin' emotions, energy gotta be felt (Felt)
I'm on eggshells with you, so, my words gotta be stealth (Stealth)
See I'm here for you, since you say I'm only for self (Oh)
I'm here for you, ain't no leaving you on the shelf (Oh, no)
I done did the wrong thing, you feel asleep with your phone unlocked, left on the home screen
Know it's against my morals, but, I had to go and see
Paragraphs with your bestfriends talkin' about me
Wasn't no other niggas, damn, I know you for me
At first I was pissed 'cause you was tellin' our business, but, who
Who else can you talk to when I'm keepin' that wall up between me and you (Between me and you)
You might also like[Chorus]
Baby tell me the truth, you ain't really used to niggas loving you too
You ain't really used to niggas being this true
Yeah, you know I had to take a shot for you
Baby, I'm hurtin' too
I gotta break down this wall of tension with you
Too show you that I got the best intentions for you
But I gotta stay consistent, if I fall, we all fall

[Post-Chorus]
Had to make it up, had to make it up
All the things I did, had to make it up
All the time I missed, gotta make it up
All the shit that they done said, they done made that up

[Verse 2]
What's love, baby, tell me what's love (Love)
Is love lookin' the other way from bitches in the club (Oh)
Is love us acting like ain't nobody on this Earth but us (Ooh, yeah)
And I know it's a fight between us and I don't want it to turn to dust (No)
I grew up in a household with my mom and my dad
Shit, love is all we had and fidelity made that shit bad
I'm a mirror of my father, I can't change that
Picked up everything he had, good and bad
Shit, how am I supposed to change that
I need some good tips, and I ain't gettin' no change back
But, nah nigga, that ain't how that work
Nigga you broke her heart, you gotta put in work
Her insecurities [?] you gotta show her, her worth again (Oh)
What's a woman's worth, 'cause if you do it again you won't be seein' her face again
Better put her first, first, first
[Outro]
Had to make it up, had to make it up
All the things I did, had to make it up
All the time I missed, gotta make it up
All the shit that they done said, they done made that up
