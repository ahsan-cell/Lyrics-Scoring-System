Check
Ten toes I ain't gonna do
I've got that one finger for the trigger
Grrah

[Build: Stormzy]
Uh-oh, who's on who?
Said you let it ring, but it never goes through
My mind's fucked, my head's gone too
The smoke's with the mandem, but the joke's on you
Uh-oh, who's on what?
Don't tell my brothers cah we'll spin the whole block
What we buyin'? Everything you got
Tell them little pussies that we take the whole lot

[Drop: Stormzy]
You ain't got no backbone
I get it out the trap, I ain't got a trap phone
I got Ps and Ms and Ks and Os
They're illiterate with letters, so I'm lettin' niggas know
Used to give them high-fives, now it's just a middle finger
Diamonds on my Patty, do the Bogle when I linger
They think I'm a rapper, I think I'm a singer (Yo)
Catch me in the cut, I treat the Urus like a dinger
Get you southern-fried, I'm a South boy on some South shit
This is Chase & Status, this ain't all that fuckin' house shit
I score a goal and I do my dance, I Peter Crouch it
Heard them brothers wanna do me somethin', but I doubt it
You might also like[Build: Stormzy]
Do me somethin' then, do me somethin' if you're bad
My mother calls me Mike, but I think I'm Jack the Lad
Tell us what you're workin' with, don't tell us what you had
I need to start my sentences with "Sorry, may I add" (Woo)

[Drop: Stormzy]
You ain't got no backbone
You ain't got no backbone

[Build: Stormzy]
Uh-oh, who's on greaze?
Said you got the mash, but you never let it squeeze
My head's hot, my wrist on freeze
I keep a little somethin' for you pussy emcees
Uh-oh, who's on what?
Don't tell my brothers cah they'll spin the whole block
What we buyin'? Everything you got
Tell them little pussies that we take the whole lot (Woo)

[Drop: Stormzy]
You ain't got no backbone
You ain't got no backbone

[Outro: Stormzy]
Do me somethin' then, do me somethin' if you're lit
My mother calls me Mike, but I think I'm the shit
Don't tell us how it used to be, just tell us how it is
They never gave me nothin', so it's fair I take the piss, pussy
