I'd never met you, but I wanted
To invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes
Never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future
For a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back
And we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens

Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt

Let me hold you now
Let me slow it down

[Pre-Chorus]
In my head right now

[Chorus]
So slow it down
Take a moment now
We're too young to drown
Deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt
Let me pull you out
Let me hold you now
Let me (Slow it down)

[Breakdown]
Slow it down
When you're on the ground
And you're crying
I'm trying (Slow it down)
To slow it down
When you're spinning 'round
In your head
[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
I'll help you slow it down3
