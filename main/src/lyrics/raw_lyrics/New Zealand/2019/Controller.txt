Ooh, I can feel her attitude
It's gotten more than in the mood
She couldn't really understand it
But now I know how he demands it
Taken hold of everything
To be your man with a diamond ring
Don't know if she can even handle
If there's love

[Pre-Chorus]
Bear in mind the things that he gave her
Caught inside a jail with a curfew
And I know
He took it away
Yes, I know (I know)
I do, I do, I do, I do, I know
He took it away

[Chorus]
See now I can make a change in an hour
And I know your path's gone sour
Well, I know, know, know
Ooh, I know

I know that he can take control and devour
But you've got to take the reins with thе power
'Cause I know, know, know
Yeah, I know
Hе'll take it away

Ooh, well, I can feel her attitude
See it's got him going in the mood
She can barely see, yeah
Taken hold of everything
To be your man with a diamond ring
Ooh, you took it away

[Pre-Chorus]
Bear in mind the things that he gave her
Caught inside a jail with a curfew
And I know
He took it away
Yes, I know (I know)
I do, I do, I do, I do, I know
He took it away

[Chorus]
See now I can make a change in an hour
And I know your path's gone sour
You know, you know, know
Ooh, I know (I know)

I know that he can take control and devour
But you've got to take the reins with the power
'Cause I know, know, know
Yeah, I know
He'll take it away
