FEEL ALRIGHT

1 (Liam):
Tell it to your brother on the street corner, looking our for somewhere to belong
Lives a life of petty crime, for survival to fend on his own
Tell it to your sister, who's screaming out for a helping hand
Abandoned by her man, seeking to understand

It's worth fighting for, so everybody feel alright
It's worth fighting for, so everybody feel alright

And with the world in perfect view, it shows the colours that are true
And what you do is up to you; spread the love that can follow through
You and you, I and I, we the ones that can fly
Open your eyes up so we can do; spread the love can follow through

2 (Roman):
Tell it to your father who lost all his things, tell him what the future holds and brings
His broken heart he needs to mend, and this good news he really depends on
Tell it to your mother who cries herself to sleep
Tell her she don't need to weep no more
This will make her stronger than she was before

It's worth fighting for, so everybody feel alright
It's worth fighting for, so everybody feel alright

And what you do is up to you; spread the love that can follow through
You and you, I and I, we the ones that can fly
Open your eyes up so we can do; spread the love can follow through

And with the world in perfect view, it shows the colours that are true
And what you do is up to you; spread the love that can follow through
You and you, I and I, we the ones that can fly
Open your eyes up so we can do; spread the love can follow through
Spread the aloha
