Want me to live up to the standard
But how i can i do what they expect me to do
When i can't do it myself
I really need someones help
In a rush now, in a rush now, yeah
When I'm feeling down and out
It makes me wanna scream and shout
Give me a lift up
Don't give me a hand out, no
I; m running on empty
I'm running on low
Somebody help me
Come-on and send out an SOS

Morning star will carry me, carry me
Lift me up, how
I said the Morning star will carry me
Carry me
Lift me up, how
It's not over now
It's not over now

During my time on this earth
I'll do my best to give my all to you
For you and you alone
