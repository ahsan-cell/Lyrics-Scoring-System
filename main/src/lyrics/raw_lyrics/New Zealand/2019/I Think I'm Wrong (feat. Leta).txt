I'll dig deep when my clothes are torn
I'll even steal and break my bones
To feel that feeling on my own

It's been hard to understand
How you sink yourself into sand
You should find another man
Keeps you happy as you plan

Maybe she was tired of the silence
All the noise in those apartments
And I keep thinking, moving on but
Oh my god my soul's flipping
I think I'm wrong
And maybe she was flying down the highway
Thinking to herself it's my way
I keep thinking, moving on
But oh my god my soul's flipping I think I'm wrong
I think I'm wrong
I, I think I'm wrong
I think I'm wrong

It's hard to say that we are grown (we are grown)
Let me know if we been told (oh let me know)
I'm gonna find a man who knows
Of how I feel and how I flow
You might also likeThen I must apologise (I apologise)
I never seen you in my eyes (yeah)
I've been blind so many times
When I saw it oh I cried (yeah)

Maybe she was tired of the silence
All the noise in those apartments
And I keep thinking, moving on but
Oh my god my soul's flipping I think I'm wrong
And maybe she was flying down the highway
Thinking to herself it's my way
And I keep thinking, moving on but
Oh my god my soul's flipping I think I'm wrong
I think I'm wrong
I, I think I'm wrong
I think I'm wrong
