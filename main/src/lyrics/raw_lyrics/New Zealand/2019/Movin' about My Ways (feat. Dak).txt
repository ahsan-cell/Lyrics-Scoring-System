Clipboards of feelings, list is wrong
Friday fightin' cruise control and said I'm a long way from home
Stop by the store and grab that Jager and a bottle of that Hennessy
Say, oh what a feelin' I had today, a feelin I had

So I drink what I wanna drink and I smoke when supposed to smoke
When theres confusing pain ahead, ahead
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways

We ended up on the south side of town
Where everything's just-a little different
Sippy cup, yeah s'been a long time afair
And we drink to those who turn in they graves
Blaze it up yeah float that around
Sometimes it's the only thang
Say oh what a feeling I had today, hey, so I

So I drink what I wanna drink and I smoke when supposed to smoke
When theres confusing pain ahead, ahead
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
You might also likeMe I movin' about my way
Said me goin' drink from the night till day
Said me goin' sip until me fallin'
All night, overflowin'
Said dear lord can you hear me, please forgive me
We sip wine, we know red drives me thirsty
Give me that feelin when ya sippin, it's creepin, it's time hey
That feelin that ya feel when ya fly away
Ain't no other way to get that feelin
Feelin when ya out to cap a roll and are with the crew while ya chillin
There be no need for no cruising
Turn off the phone cause tonight there'll be no choosing
Me and my bottle you with the zig zag
Me going drink until me feel a little jet lag
So if ya with me, goin wanna sip it up
And when ya runnin low, slide through I'll fill ya up

So I drink what I wanna drink and I smoke when supposed to smoke
When theres confusing pain ahead, ahead
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways

So I drink what I wanna drink and I smoke when supposed to smoke
When theres confusing pain ahead, ahead
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
I'm just movin' about my ways
