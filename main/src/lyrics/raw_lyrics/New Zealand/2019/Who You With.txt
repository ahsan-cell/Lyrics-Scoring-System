Making it easy..
Coz I don't wanna be alone
Baby

[Chorus]
Wrap it up
Throw it all in the papers
Wrap it up
Gonna need it at the clubs tonight
Who you with, who you with
Coz I'm gonna have some tonight
Wrap it up
And if you do me a favour
Wrap it up
I'll pick you up and it will be so nice
Who you with, who you with
Coz I'm gonna have some tonight

[Verse 1]
Gonna get partied
Gonna be shore
Gonna do all the things that appeal to me
I'll do it all
Just to make it all easy
Gonna set it off slow
And everything gonna take me
Through it all
Making it easy
Coz I don't wanna be alone
Baby
You might also like[Chorus]
Wrap it up
Throw it all in the papers
Wrap it up
Gonna need it at the clubs tonight
Who you with, who you with
Coz I'm gonna have some tonight
Wrap it up
And if you do me a favour
Wrap it up
I'll pick you up and it will be so nice
Who you with, who you with
Coz I'm gonna have some tonight

[Verse 2]
Practising up at Armodillos
Just to burn it all clear
And then I'll be spinning out around hood street
Nobody's gonna care
You know you make me all jelly
When you do me like that
Now I'm feeling everything like I thought I would
Might as well share
Making it easy
Coz I don't wanna be alone
Baby
[Chorus]
Wrap it up
Throw it all in the papers
Wrap it up
Gonna need it at the clubs tonight
Who you with, who you with
Coz I'm gonna have some tonight
Wrap it up
And if you do me a favour
Wrap it up
I'll pick you up and it will be so nice
Who you with, who you with
Coz I'm gonna have some tonight

Oh na na na na
