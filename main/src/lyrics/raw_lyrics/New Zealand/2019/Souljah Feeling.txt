Let this feeling of Jah let it come to you let the sunshine through, and I
I know that your heart and your mind are troubled
Got to allow Jah to take it away from you, oh

I oh I, I need that souljah feeling, yeah
Oh I oh I, I need that souljah, souljah, souljah feeling

And you should never be down, oh aye
When the times get bad, or you don't understand
Its all in, it's all is just Jah Jah's plan
We are to stand together and unite, ooh I

I oh I, I need that souljah feeling, yeah
Oh I oh I, I need that souljah, souljah, souljah feeling

Bridge
When you don't find what you're looking for
And you're heading to where you can't search no more
It's time to get up and start that healing
Cos you got to go, you got to know, you got that souljah feeling

I oh I, I need that souljah feeling, yeah
Oh I oh I, I need that souljah, souljah, souljah feeling
I oh I, I need that souljah feeling, yeah
Oh I oh I, I need that souljah, souljah, souljah feelingYou might also like
