Sitting high in summer skies
The city lights shine bright
Welcoming the night
They flicker on like fireflies
And a glow that lets you know
The day is by
I never thought it would get to this
But I never think things through
I was supposed to spend my life with you
But I messed up second chances too many times
Guess that's what I get for being reckless

[Chorus]
I hope you're happy now
I'm still the same
Nothing's changed
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
But when you left, my light went out
And I've never been the same

[Verse 2]
When the clock strikes midnight, summer ends
Last year we brought in the fall together
Even the best stories come to end
I just thought that we were right, ours together
You might also like[Chorus]
I hope you're happy now
I'm still the same
Nothing's changed
I thought I'd have it figured out by now
But when you left, my light went out
And I've never been the same
