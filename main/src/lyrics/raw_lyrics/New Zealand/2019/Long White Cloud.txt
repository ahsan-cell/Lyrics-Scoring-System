Aotearoa, he toku kainga
My home, my heart, my provider
Always loving and giving, yeah
It's a wonderful melting pot
From the streets to the mountain tops
Memory of roadies in a Ford Cortina, with my mama singin'
Bye, bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levy but the levy was dry
Always gotta stop it
See my fans catch up with the cousins
Oh yeah, we are the new generation
Welcome, this is an open invitation
Bless up and enjoy your time, and it's up to the next in line

[Chorus: Lion Rezz]
See I'm from, I'm from
The most beautiful place in the sun
Me say de long white cloud
Me say de long white cloud

[Verse 3: Lion Rezz]
Full of trees and a mountain so green
We can't get enough of it
Pleased to meet you in this beautiful country
Bless up Pina, the long white cloud
Over here we say, "Kia ora
He pehe ana koe"
In response we say, "Chur ma Maori"
This is the new generation
Welcome, this is an open invitation
Blessed are the people of Aotearoa
[Chorus: Lion Rezz]
See I'm from, I'm from
The most beautiful place in the sun
Me say de long white cloud
Me say de long white cloud
