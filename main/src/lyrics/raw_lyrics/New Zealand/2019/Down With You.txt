All right, yeah, yeah
Woah, na na yeah

[Verse 1:]
Hey there my pretty lover, number one stunna
Body like no other
I'm givin' you the deal, how I really feel
Hooked on your lovin' for real
Many try, but chosen a few
Now my eyes only see you
I wanna pack it up a two, know just what to do
One chance to give it true to you

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I'm down with you
Them things you doin' lately
‘Cause I'm down with you
Let's do it on a daily
‘Cause I'm down with you
Ooh, your look is drivin' me crazy
Any more of that love that you gave me

[Refrain:]
I can see it in your … ah-ah-ah-ah-eyes
I can see it in your … ah-ah-ah-ah-eyes

Hey there, I won't be late
Scoop you from your crib around eight
We can fire up the tub, do the rub-a-dub
Later we can tear up the club
Like a diamond in every single way
And I count my blessings every day
You're a perfect display and there's nothin' more to say
Take me home I wanna play, yeah

[Chorus:]
‘Cause I'm down with you
Them things you doin' lately
‘Cause I'm down with you
Let's do it on a daily
‘Cause I'm down with you
Ooh, your look is drivin' me crazy
Any more of that love that you gave me

[Bridge:]
Before you make your big decision
I wanna disclose details of the mission
Figure out your favorite position
Germinate seeds to fruition
‘Cause your love is so hard to find
And you do it naturally, no need to try
From the eyes to the thighs, flawless design
Can't get you off of my mind
[Chorus:]
‘Cause I'm down with you
Them things you doin' lately
‘Cause I'm down with you
Let's do it on a daily
‘Cause I'm down with you
Ooh, your look is drivin' me crazy
Any more of that love that you gave me

[Refrain:]
I can see it in your ah-ah-ah-ah-eyes (I see it, no lie)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-eyes (My one and only, yeah)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-eyes (I couldn't let you walk on by)
Ah-ah-ah-ah-eyes (Can you see it, I-L-Y)
