So I heard you want to talk, funny
Eat that shit right up, munchies
Usually I love the attention
But now I'm in another dimension

[Pre-Chorus]
Today's a bad day, maybe hit me up tomorrow
Maybe next week, hit me up when there's a full moon
Say I need space, it's a place that I'll be going
Blasting off like

[Chorus]
Avoid that shit in my rocketship
Take a hint, I'm in my rocket
Avoid that shit in my rocketship
Take a hint, I'm in my rocket

Trying to ring me, it don't matter
There's no service here on saturn
Avoid that shit in my rocketship
Take a hint

[Verse 2]
You know, I'm sorry, I should be worried but I'm astro-not
Saw you at the party looking for me, gonna go get crossed
It's not that I don't care, I'm just bеing careful
It's not that I don't feel, just wanna feel immortal

Today's a bad day, maybe hit me up tomorrow
Maybе next week, hit me up when there's a full moon
Say I need space, it's a place that I'll be going
Blasting off like

[Chorus]
Avoid that shit in my rocketship
Take a hint, I'm in my rocket
Avoid that shit in my rocketship
Take a hint, I'm in my rocket

Trying to ring me, it don't matter
There's no service here on saturn
Avoid that shit in my rocketship
Take a hint


(Please don't try to contact me, I'm unavailable in my rocket. AKA smoking a joint, nobody fuck with me. Haha.)
