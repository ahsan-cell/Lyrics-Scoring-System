And I didn't know that everything would take a turn
Until I recently discovered that you had another brother
And he got a lot of money to burn
So you tried to keep it secret
Everyday you went to meet him
But you said you doing overtime
What you think I'm really stupid like I'm listening to cupid
And I can't see in front of my eyes?
Now you so played out
The room is getting quiet like a slow fade out
The feelings that I had up in lights are greyed out
I should go and pack up a bag and break out
But like a stakeout I just watch very quietly
And don't say nothing
But then the repercussions gone hit you quite sudden
You 'gonna come home when you had a great day
Then I'm gonna sit you down and say

You think I love you so
(Huh)
But I'm about to let you go
You think I love you so
But I'm about to let you go

Now you so played out
It's getting kinda quiet like a slow fade out
The feelings that I had up in lights are greyed out
I should go grab my things and break out
But like a stakeout I just sit very still and I don't say nothing
But then the repercussions gonna hit you quite sudden
You gonna come home when had the best day
Then I'm gonna sit you down and say
You might also likeYou think I love you so
(Huh)
But I'm about to let you go
You think I love you so
But I'm about to let you go
