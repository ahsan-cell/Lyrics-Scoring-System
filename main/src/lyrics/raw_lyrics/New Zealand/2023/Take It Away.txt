Let's go
Huh

[Verse 1]
You got me runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
I'm runnin' out my head
Livin' in your mystery
There's something there to say
And now I can take hold of the future
And no one else will pay
You're always when I need you, there
To hear what I say

[Chorus]
Take it away
Somewhere to go
Lead me astray
Where nobody knows, hey

[Verse 2]
You hear me yellin' out, runnin' out
Runnin' out of ideas
Come and tell me what you need to me
Make it loud and clear
Now I wanna know, I gotta know
Tell me, I can't hear, yеah
Come and tell me what you need to mе
Make it loud and clear
You might also like[Chorus]
Take it away
Somewhere to go
Lead me astray
Where nobody knows
Take it away
Somewhere to go
Lead me astray
Uh, uh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
You got to pick up, pick up, just to hear me sing
Pick up on the phone when the phone bell ring
Tell me on the phone, I can make some plans
Run into your home, somethin' I will bring
No one else, baby, we must do
Make it to your home, takin' off my shoes
Holdin' me close, feel the warm embrace
Look me in the eyes, I can see your face

[Chorus]
Take it away
Somewhere to go
Lead me astray
Where nobody knows
Take it away (I know)
Somewhere to go (I know)
Lead me astray (Yeah, yeah)
Nobody knows
Take it away (I know)
(Oh, oh, I know)
Lead me astray (Oh, uh)
Ooh, ooh
