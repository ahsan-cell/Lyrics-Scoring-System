It's cold breathing in the dark
Take me on, I'll lead you there
And call me when you'll be far
I don't wanna let you down
Slow leaving up too long
Ooh, I feel it in the air
You know me, I'll keep you on

I see it and then turn around
You move me but I want more
The memory is in the air

And music is all we need
Ooh, I feel it, can't you see?
(Can't you see?)
You know me, I'll keep you there

[Bridge]
Ooh, I get that feeling
Can I take you on a ride?
(Take you on a ride?)
Knowing what I know
I can see it, baby, in your eyes
'Cause it's going, we're full 'til the morning

Can I take you home tonight?
(You can take me home tonight)
We're flying beneath the sheets
Holding on to make me strong (Ooh)
Tonight is the night I need
