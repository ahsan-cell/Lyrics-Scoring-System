One bag for the whip, four bags for my stick
Two hands on the twelve, M flying to the Fifth
Three waps in the wizz, turn it Tokyo Drift
Ask the opps who I've slapped, I ain't shooting no kids
You ain't shot one soul, tell my opps "Stop lying"
You ain't been in the ride, hopped out, shots flying
You ain't argued with bro, who's shooting, who's driving
He said I'll get rich, everything's in due timing

[Verse 1]
Stop the car right now, I see a face that I've clocked
A few seconds go by and it's the face that I've shot
You ain't taking my spot, we ain't mashed the same works
I can tell you bout this life, show you how the game works
I can send you on the M, bring you back full of packs
I'm from that dirty side of Huddersfield, town full of straps
They never knew about H-U-D until I rapped
And didn't know about the opps until two got packed

[Chorus]
One bag for the whip, four bags for my stick
Two hands on the twelve, M flying to the Fifth
Three waps in the wizz, turn it Tokyo Drift
Ask the opps who I've slapped, I ain't shooting no kids
You ain't shot one soul, tell my opps "Stop lying"
You ain't been in the ride, hopped out, shots flying
You ain't argued with bro, who's shooting, who's driving
He said I'll get rich, everything's in due timing

Things fall into place, you gotta wait and be patient
This wap's from the Asians, bullets from the Jamaicans
We stepped out and turned our pagans half disabled
Then feds kicked the door in with M5's and lasers
I'm a big problem for opps and they know that
Internet trolling won't get their bros back
I'm a head shot specialist, check the throwbacks
And all that knife work, I shoulda made my own programme
Never once folded, I stepped and I stayed on it
Booter's a gunman, his shank got stains on it
Five for the whip, twenty-five what I made from it
Bro got a L-plate, pissed cah I prayed for him, no cap
Riding round the hood with two straps
Just made ten off a new batch
You was in the yard with two chicks
I was in the ride with two sticks
Just spent four on this new drip

[Chorus]
One bag for the whip, four bags for my stick
Two hands on the twelve, M flying to the Fifth
Three waps in the wizz, turn it Tokyo Drift
Ask the opps who I've slapped, I ain't shooting no kids
You ain't shot one soul, tell my opps "Stop lying"
You ain't been in the ride, hopped out, shots flying
You ain't argued with bro, who's shooting, who's driving
He said I'll get rich, everything's in due timing
