Everybody said, "You better stay in school"
"Get a real job, boy, don't be a fool"
"Burn that guitar, you can never be a star"
I can, I can, I can, so

[Pre-Chorus]
A thousand disbelievers couldn't keep me on the ground
I've invented a momentum that'll never slow me down
I believe it cause I feel it and I shout it out loud
I can, I can, I can, so

[Chorus]
Everybody said, "Boy, don't go any higher"
(Uh uh, fuck that) I can do anything
"Never push the limit and don't play with fire"
(Uh uh, fuck that) I can do anything

[Post-Chorus]
Wear my heart on my fist
Take you by surprise fighter
(Uh uh, fuck that) I can do anything

[Verse 2]
Be a movie star or rock the main stage
An Xbox tester or an astronaut in space
If they tell you that you can't
You can shove it in their face
I can, I can, I can, so

[Bridge]
Never try, never win, never get a break
You miss a hundred percent of the shots you never take

[Chorus 2x] + [Post-Chorus]

[Outro]
Everybody said, "Boy, don't go any higher"
(Uh uh, fuck that) I can do anything
