I get strung up from her loving
I wish she'd care to see
But she only cares when she's got the time
And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be
But our destinies got us intertwined

[Pre-Chorus]
And is it really my fault
I get a shiver when I see her with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why

[Chorus]
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it

[Verse 2]
What is she thinking, too much uncertainty
Why can't she give some sort of sign
You know and I know a thing or two about loyalty
But that girl donâ€™t pay it no mind

And is it really my fault
I get a shiver when I see her with those other guys
Wearing the jacket I bought
I can't help but lose my temper and I don't know why

[Chorus]
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it

[Bridge]
I get strung up from her loving
I wish she'd cared to see
But she only cares when she's so inclined
And I fret so much about her loving
I wish she'd let me be
But out destinies got us so intertwined
Back in 2011, I decided
To not let this play with my mind
But when the boys from out of town
They come back around
I feel like committing a crime, yeah
[Chorus]
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas talk to my girl I ain't with it
I get jealous, but I'm too cool to admit it
When the fellas, talk to my girl I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it
I ain't with it, I ain't with it, I ain't with it32
