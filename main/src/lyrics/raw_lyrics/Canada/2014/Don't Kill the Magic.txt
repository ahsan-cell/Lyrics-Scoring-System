If you want space (You could have it)
If you want change (You could have it)
Sleep on your bed (You could have it)
Pull it to my head (You could have it)
If you want love (You could have it)
The way that you love (You could have it)
If you want time (You could have it)
I'll tell you no lie (You could have it)

[Chorus]
Just don't kill, don't kill the magic (Oh-oh)
Just don't kill, don't kill the magic (Oh-oh)
I'm not ready to give up just yet
We could stay until we both forget
So baby, donâ€™t kill (Don't kill)
Don't kill the magic (Woah)
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
If you want space (You could have it)
If you want change (I'll make it drastic)
Sleep on your bed (I'll be your mattress)
Bullet to my head (You could blast it)
Oh, if you want love (I'll be tragic)
The way that you love (I can match it)
If you want time (I'll be elastic)
I'll tell you no lie (You could have it)
No lie

Don't kill the magic (Woah)

[Bridge]
Take my arms, take my legs, take my vision (Take, take, take, take)
Take my tongue, take my lungs, if you need it (Take, take, take, take, woah)
On my knees, on my knees, on my knees, I beg (Yeah)
Hey
Don't you see I'm tryna fix this, baby? (Ooh, ooh)
Every beat in my heart gone spazzy
I will do, I will do anything it takes (Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
Just don't kill, don't kill the magic (Oh-oh)
Just don't kill, don't kill the magic (Oh-oh)
I'm not ready to give up just yet

So baby, don't kill (Don't kill)
Don't kill the magic (Woah)
