Something isnt right with us, I've been listening, paying attention, you don't listen, you've been givin, You've been standing up, your time, out there lying, oh

[Verse]
It's been hard to forget, your up above while I sit, breaking my heart cus I fell in love, I felt your music, you made me feel like i wasn't alone, since u got shot I've been hurting worse, this sick earth is a curse, this earth is fucking wicked, nope, it's not good, I wish I could, have done something but i couldn't of, I'm glad that bitch got beat and raped, who ever did that should be capped they're my hero, the bitch is a zero, now i get anxiety when i go out in public, I get anxiety cus of this fucked up society, and that lil bitch lied to me, I still hope one day you faked all of this, pop out of that casket and say viral, life has been a spiral since that day, people call me names cus I got sad when you left this earth, I was mad I was hurt, still hurting, why are girls flirting with dudes when they got a boy, to them we are just toys, are u amused, I feel used, dreams of X coming up to me saying it will be ight, then him vanishing into the light, If god does exist how could he take innocent lives, is this what he thrives? That's someone people worship. I'm sick of this fucked up shit
Â long live X, rest your soul, sick and tired of this dumb ass shit fuck the world, God just loves it when we die dont he, thinking this might be my last goodbye
Thinking your the only one that dont lie, to me, why can't people see what I see, no matter what I'll stand up tall, especially when people are wanting me to fall, just for you. And that is true
