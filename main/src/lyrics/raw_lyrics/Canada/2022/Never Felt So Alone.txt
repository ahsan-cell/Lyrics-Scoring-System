Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus: Labrinth, Labrinth & Billie Eilish]
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na

[Verse 1: Labrinth, Labrinth & Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish]
In a whip (Woah), thinkin', "What if (Woah)
You and this (Woah) never existed?"
Hollow kiss (Woah), bottle liquor (Oh)
Man, I'm sick, man, I'm schizo

[Pre-Chorus: Labrinth, Labrinth & Billie Eilish]
All white leather
You know this man ain't shit without you in the interior (I'm dyin' somewhere in the dark)
All white leather
And I think, "What if we weren't ridin' and dyin' together?"
The whole world would fall apart

[Chorus: Labrinth & Billie Eilish, Billie Eilish, Labrinth]
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na (Never felt so alone, woo! Alone)
And I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
You might also like[Verse 2: Billie Eilish & Labrinth]
I thought you were my new best friend (My)
Wish I knew better then
Who knew you were just out to get me?
My whole world just fell apart

[Outro: Billie Eilish & Labrinth]
'Cause I never felt so alone, felt so alone, na-na
I could never be more alone than when I ain't got you here2
