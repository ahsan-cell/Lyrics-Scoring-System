If I had it my way, I would take you down
If I had it my way, I would turn you out
And if my body had a say, I would come again
Scared of what I might say, 'cause I'm at the edge

[Pre-Chorus]
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room
There's only one thing left for us to do

[Chorus]
You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland, take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth, baby, I would do
Just what I want to

[Verse 2]
If I had it my way, I would take the lead
And if I had it my way, I would take you deep
If my body had a say, I'd get it off my chest
Show you all the red lace underneath this dress

[Pre-Chorus]
And our eyes are crossing paths across the room (Ooh)
There's only one thing left for us to do
You might also like[Chorus]
You can touch me with slow hands
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland, take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth, baby, I would do
Just what I want to

[Bridge]
My mind's getting in the way
Can't feel what my body say
I'ma tell you anyway
I'ma tell you anyway
My mind's getting in the way
Can't feel what my body say
I'ma show you anyway
I'ma show you anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
There's only one thing left for us to do
Oh, you can

[Chorus]
You can touch me with slow hands (Yeah)
Speed it up, baby, make me sweat
Dreamland, take me there 'cause I want your sex
If my body had a say (Body had a say), I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth, baby, I would do
Just what I want to
You can touch me with slow hands (Hands)
Dreamland (Land)
If my body had a say, I wouldn't turn away
Touch, make love, taste you
If my body told the truth, baby, I would do
Just what I want to (Want to)28
