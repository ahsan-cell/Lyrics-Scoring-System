Take my hand or take over
Take my hand (Ooh) or-or take over
Take my hand (Ooh) or take over
Take my hand or take over

[Verse]
These presents don't really come for free
Your paychecks don't mean that much to me
Just take my hand and hold me tight
You'll never buy my love
You buy me this and you buy me that
To win over, wn me over
You got me wrong and that's a fact
Something that you've got to notice

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you realize when I'm gone
That I dance to a different song?
Will you rеalize when I'm gone
That I dancе to a different song?
It's a shame, but I've got to go

[Chorus]
Take my hand or take over
Take my hand (Ooh) or-or take over
Take my hand (Ooh) or take over
Take my hand or take overYou might also like
