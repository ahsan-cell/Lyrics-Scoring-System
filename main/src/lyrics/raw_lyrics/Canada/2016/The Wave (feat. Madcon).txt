When I'm with you, it's like all I need
Someone to wait it out and to catch the wave with me
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So bring me the summer with you, babe
And let's catch that wave

[Verse 1: Madcon]
Pool parties at the Montreal
Everybody wet but still thirsty
Half-naked thoughts, what an ambiance
With more nipple slips than at Mardi Gras
I got that good wave
I see 'em all puttin' in that work for me
It's like they want that good grade
It's like they want the goods
Got them Sundays on me with Miami great Heat
Next day, won, oh damn it, no sleep
The summer go hard
I'm on my forever young thing all week
And repeat it
Uh, too young of a soul to settle down
Too old to be such a fucking child, yeah
So wherever you are on this 31st
I pray you to take me back 'cause you're all I got
You might also like[Chorus: RAYE]
Maybe this time, you'll be all I need
Someone to wait it out and to catch the wave with me, oh
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So bring me the summer with you, babe
And let's catch that wave

[Verse 2: Madcon]
Ah, the next day be like yesterday
So we ain't gotta wait for tomorrow
My only ID is my resum√©
So we packing our chicks in the SUV
Man, I'm on that good wave
I see 'em all puttin' in that twerk for me
It's like they want that good grade
It's like they know what's good
Got the party in the hills, I ain't looking for a wife (Nah)
Six in the morning, 'bout that Hollywood life
The summer go hard
And my homeboy Matoma bring the party, that hype
Bet you know it, yeah
But every coin has another side, uh
And every chick has another guy, yeah
That's why every August 31st
I pray you to take me back 'cause you're all I got
[Bridge: Madcon]
You
'Cause I be rubbing and kissing and loving and hugging my boo
You were part of me
You're to die for, I'm gone, yeah
You were part of me
'Cause I be rubbing and kissing and loving and hugging my boo
I give you my heart babe
I'm going in (Surf's up), hit the waves

[Chorus: RAYE]
Maybe this time, you'll be all I need
Someone to wait it out and to catch the wave with me, oh
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So bring me the summer with you, babe
And let's catch that wave

[Outro: RAYE]
When I'm with you, it's like all I need
Someone to wait it out and to catch the wave with me
Maybe you are what I'm waiting for
So bring me the summer with you, babe
And let's catch that wave
