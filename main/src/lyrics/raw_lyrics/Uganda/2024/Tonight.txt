And we will pull the anchors for tonight
Beyond the horizon we'll throttle your engines
And give you one comfortable ride
Meet that someone you've waited for
He's waiting for you up in the bar
There is a twenty four hour buffet with a fountain
Of chocolate for the fruits of your heart
Tonight come and ride
The governor is waiting so patient in the casino tonight
He says we are autonomous
Our hunger is bottomless
The economy is golden just for tonight
Tonight come and ride
This is how God made us to live
On California the cruise ship
Bring your wife and your kids
To California the cruise ship
Tonight come and rideYou might also like
