Aye, ooh, aye, okay-okay

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go out now, right now, wanna die now
Never thought you'd let me down
You fucked around in my place
How could you lie to my face
While you prove me right now, lights out, kinda shy how
You were in it for the high
But you were down in my maze
Crying to me when he flakes

[Chorus]
So you can leave
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back, no I won't do that
And you blew me
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back, no I won't do that

[Verse 2]
Losing my mind, you should know
Losing my mind, you should go
Let me know, let it show
Losing my mind, you should know
Losing my mind, you should go
Let me know, let it show
But you can have me, want me, dump me
Everybody knows that you used to be bubbly
Lightly, spite me, slyly
You looking back at a door, so
You might also like[Chorus]
You can leave
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back, no I won't do that
And you blew me
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back, no I won't do that
So you can leave
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back, no I won't do that
And you blew me
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back
I don't wanna be the one to hold you back, no I won't do that
No I won't do that
