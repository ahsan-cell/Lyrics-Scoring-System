{Verse 1 0:28}
It's been a long way to the top
Let alone having people appreciate me
Gods gift even atheists believe, maybe
I'm everything that the people want {want}
One things for sure dawg it wasn't luck
Sitting in the basement for 3 cold winters
Slowly creating a heatwave without the summer sun
What I call fun, is making music for you to bump
Forget a 9 to 5 I'm doing what I want/
Alotta haters despise me, my rhyming
Is so dirty I could use the extra lining
It all came with perfect timing and the stars aligning/
The hardest thing is selling my words, spreading my verbs
Convincing non-believers, and the haters too start buying
As funny as it seems, I'm still outta reach of where I want to be
Headed in a direction that most people can't see...

{Hook 1:12} Repeat 2X
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success
It sucks too much stress
But, I'mma stay focused, I'm livin in the moment
I'm doing what I want before I die, I gotta show it

It was all a, dre-e-eam
I use to sit back and think about, being somebody that they talk about
So now I'm reminiscing back to the times in school
No one gave a fuck but now they do, shit thats a common move
I wasn't bad quite shy when I first started spitting rhymes
Now anytime I touch a mic I kill it
With a plan to transition from this average livin
You gotta go get it, I got it, I don't need to be the hottest
I'd rather be the person you remember for just being honest
I'm to deep, I'm to deep that I'm drowning in my own thoughts
A fountain when I flow dawg, I think you should have a sip
To quench your thirst, hating on me will only make it worse
I reimburse wit consistency at a rate to make ya speakers burst
Allow me to tell you what I told them, allow me to tell you what I told them...

{Hook 2:17} Repeat 2X
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success
It sucks too much stress
But, I'mma stay focused, I'm livin in the moment
I'm doing what I want before I die, I gotta show it1
