May I please have some of it too?
Oh, I hope that it does not
Give you indigestion
This was once a true phantasy of mine
S***, it's f****** bonkers
At the farmers’ market
We drove the g** d*** Jeep
And there’s no place to park it
What the f***? Cuss!
Check out that lazy dude
With all that crazy food
Handing ample samples
Out to non-customers
F****** find that punk
If s*** ever gets dire
G** d***! He's Superman!
Who the h***’s his supplier?
Rapunzel, Rapunzel
Let down your spaghetti
Seriously though, he’s packing
Chow like confetti
