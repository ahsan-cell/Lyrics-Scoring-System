Can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Especially your python move
The way you hold that thing
Me wan hold that thing
Baby let me take a look
Oh Lord
Me want all girls in da whole world
I know what I’m doing is so wrong
But since no man can focus
We definitely don’t give a fuck

[Chorus]
She said she know me get a girlfriend
And so what
What if I

What if I do?
She said she know me get a woman on me bed
What if I

What if I do?

[Verse 2]

So me girlfriend say she wants me back home by 2
What will I do?
So me tell her say my car broke down at mile 2
Girl I won’t be home so soon
Oh Lord
Mе want all the girls in da whole world
I know what I’m doing is so wrong
But since no man can focus
Wе definitely don’t give a fuck

And If you burst up my brain too much

Can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Especially your python move
The way you hold that thing
