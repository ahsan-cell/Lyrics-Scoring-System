Scatter my dada, Medulla bololo

Make you do nono

[Chorus]
Folake don pompous
She don dey drive Brabus, so
She no dey talk to us again
She no dey come campus again
Dem say she go do runs
And her hippopo don tamus
And her kinni dey cause virus, ewee
They just dey talk jargons
'Cause na she wey dey make my heart beat
Parara rara rara rara
Na she make my heart beat
Parara rara rara rara
Na she make my hеart beat
Parara rara rara rara
Na she make my hеart beat
Parara rara rara rara
