Cook that thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Man getting high till I fade out
If the vibe no pure, on my way out
Hullabaloo anytime we step out
The men dem outside, we no dey house
No dey look for us, we no dey house
You no dey see the mula we don spray out
Thank God say the maga don pay out
Ope oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
See, I'm ahead of them, asiwaju
I'm a fucking baller, Ighalo ni mi
No man fit talk shit to me
Ni'lu mi, you go collect oh
See, omo na me dey lead, asiwaju
I'm a fucking baller, Ighalo ni mi
No man fit talk shit to me
Ni'lu mi, you go collect oh

[Verse 1]
Cheers to my friends and clique
When I call, demma all pulling up quick
Strapped up with the guns and the swords and things
Bring hеll to anybody wey try test me
I'm your daddy, I'm your unclе, I'm your popsy
I be old man, no go dey call me "Gen Z"
Bredda see
Steady giving them gap, mo ti lo far
They can never near me
As my lover, lover, just go
My oyinbo wife, don show
Omo, my polo white, my face show
Sweet boy for life, they don't know
Your serious babe dey worry my phone
E don dey sup for back, you don't know
Everyday we dey run am on code
You suppose to know how the thing go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Omo, na different steeze
Singlet, belt, and ripped out jeans
Man too wise, I no fit loose that cheese
Oluwa thunder my body with blessings
Ogbeni, ogbeni leave that thing
When I say kukuruku cook that thing

Oya look that thing
Face white, yansh black, I rebuke that thing
Make nobody try stress me, I no be JJC
I don't if you get it on a top rating
Affiliate with the best team, you wan race me
We no dey do the same thing, hmm, hmm
Canoe no be jet ski, omo you say wetin?
No go reason me less, omo, you go chop crapping
I do it diligently, won le mi
Won le ba mi

Thank God say the maga don pay out

No dey look for us, we no dey house
You no dey see the mula we don spray out
Thank God say the maga don pay out
Ope oh-oh-oh-oh
