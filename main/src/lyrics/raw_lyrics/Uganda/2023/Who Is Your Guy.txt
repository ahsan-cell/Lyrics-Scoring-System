Who is your guy? (Spyro)
Na only me walahi
See as we dey like beans and rice
I will never leave your side (I will never ever go)
I dedicate my time
To you my guy
Even if the road rough, I no mind
'Cause you be my gee for life

[Verse]
Yeah I'm feeling good tonight
'Cause I dey here with my guy
I get plenty for my mind (Mind)
But right now am with my guy (My guy)
I no dey fear, dem gat my back
Shey you don see my formation?
Agbalagbi combination
Sight the inspiration
And one hundred concentration
When my guy dem wole oh (Wole oh)
Bad energy far away oh (Far away oh)
I thank God for my real gees
Good friends no be money

[Chorus]
Who is your guy?
Na only me walahi
See as we dey like beans and rice
I will never leave your side (I will never ever go)
I dedicate my time
To you my guy
Even if the road rough, I no mind
'Cause you be my gee for life
You might also like[Outro]
