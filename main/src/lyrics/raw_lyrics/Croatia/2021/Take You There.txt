Back and forth like a tug of war
I can't fight this
I want the pleasure then I want the money
What if I miss
The plans that you have in your hands
For the night thrills
Elijah’s desire
Oh take me higher

[Chorus]
I'm Gatsby (strait up)
It's not what it seems (oh my)
I’m Gatsby (ok)
Appearance verse reality
I'm Gatsby (yeah)
I'm looking out for my Daisy
I'm Gatsby (alright)
Across the water watching green

[Bridge 1]
Don't let go (don't let go, oh)
Don't let go (don't let go, oooh)
Don’t let go (don’t let go, oooooh)
Don't let go (don’t let go, yeah)

Don't talk the talk just practice
Living your life like an actress
You say you soft but you cactus
I don't conform to these tactics
Keep poking holes in the plastic
They find the truth man that's drastic
If I hold on fantastic
He let you go it’s bombastic
Oh my
I want my daisy
I'll try
Not to be crazy
Why lie
When You my baby
Ima never let go
It's amazing
Chapter after chapter losing my sanity (oh no)
Time after time I'm gaining my vanity (oh oh)
What if I lose it all for the whole world (the world)
Then I'll die in vain ending the world (the world)
All these contracts heading my way (my way)
I don't wanna give you up for a day (a day)
It's a battle everyday day in my mind (my mind)
Let me take you there I hope you confide
[Bridge 2]

Back and forth like a tug of war
I can't fight this
I want the pleasure then I want the money
What if I miss
The plans that you have in your hands
For the night thrills
Elijah's desire
Make me come up higher
I'm Gatsby
Appearance verse reality
Watching the water turn green
(yeah, yeah)
[Chorus 2]
I'm Gatsby
(it's not what it seems)
I'm Gatsby
(appearance verse reality)
I'm Gatsby
(I'm looking out for my Daisy)
I'm Gatsby
(across the water watching green)
I'm Gatsby
Oh I'm Gatsby
I'm Gatsby
I'm Gatsby (yeah)
