Turn, the, TV, off, turn, me, on
Disbelief confidence is gone
You, can, take, all, this, from, me
Stands my integrity, now

[Pre-Chorus 1: Ali Tabatabaee]
I'm so sick of mother fuckers
Crooked wars that they wage
Should I sit and count the seconds till were all blown away?
Sex, tyrants, violence on the news everyday
Ignorance turned anger into hate
Turn away
Strength in diversity, unity and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity and revolution

[Chorus: Justin Mauriello]
Now, ya gone, ya gone, you're gone and it's forever
Nothing is the same
Right-to-right to wrong we'll come together
Time to make a change

[Verse: Justin Mauriello]
Turn, the, TV, off, turn, me, on
Disbelief confidence is gone
You, can, take, all, this, from, me
Stands my integrity, now
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2: Ali Tabatabaee]
And these wars that we wage
Why? An eye for an eye
So I lock, load, engage
Casualty- high supply
We'll be missing all our friends who die to get us by
Courage facing fear
Hate increase decline
Strength in diversity, unity and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity and evolution
Strength in diversity, unity and revolution

[Chorus: Justin Mauriello]
Now, ya gone, ya gone, you're gone and it's forever
Nothing is the same
Right-to-right to wrong we'll come together
Time to make a change

[Pre-Chorus: Ali Tabatabaee]
(Strength) in diversity, unity and evolution
(Strength) in diversity, unity and evolution
(Strength) in diversity, unity and evolution
(Strength) in diversity, unity and revolution

[Verse: Justin Mauriello]
Turn, the, TV, off, turn, me, on
Disbelief confidence is gone
If, you, take, all, of, this, from, me
Then all of you can (come together)
[Chorus: Justin Mauriello]
Now, ya gone, ya gone, you're gone and it's forever
Nothing is the same
Right-to-right to wrong we'll come together
Time to make a change

[Outro: Justin Mauriello]
Turn, the, TV, off, turn, me, on
Disbelief confidence is gone
If, you, take, all, of, this, from, me
Stands my integrity
