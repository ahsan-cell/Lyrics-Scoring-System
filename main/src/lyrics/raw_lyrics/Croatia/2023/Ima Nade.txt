Come to United States and I'm a fly ass nigga
And you can't say shit about me
We out here, feelin' like a superstar
Remember days I used to, you know, let kids under my skin kind of
So now I buy any shoes, I buy your bitch

[Chorus: Ramriddlz]
I only pull up in black trucks
Step out with bad sluts
Walk in smoking magma
Puff puff, give me asthma
Got so much ass, ma
Wide like plasma
White bitch like Ivana
Think I'm sweet like anana

[Verse 1: Ramriddlz]
Got so high, yeah I'm soaring (In the sky)
I'm so fly, got deported (I'm an alien)
Couldn't cross me the border (Amrika)
So I got me a lawyer (He's a Jew, I'm good)
But when I'm bored, I board to Bora Bora
When I was poor was going door to door-a
Now I'm an explorer like I'm Dora (Ah ola, chica)
I had a little taste now I need more-a
I want it, so I'ma go and get it (Now I do)
She begging, like, "Ram, I know you read it" (Oh yeah, I did)
I dead it, I bet she gon' regret it
Don't sweat it, forgot you so forget it

I only pull up in black trucks
Step out with bad sluts
Walk in smoking magma
Puff puff, give me asthma
Got so much ass, ma
Wide like plasma
White bitch like Ivana
Think I'm sweet like anana

[Verse 2: Booggz]
I'm so fly, got deported (Deported)
Russian Creams, they imported (I snuck 'em in)
V-I-P, so important (I'm so important)
Black trucks, we get escorted (Black trucks only)
Drugs in and exported (In and out)
Her name Dora, we exploring (We exploring)
When I'm bored, I'm Bora Bor-ing (Bora, Bora, Bora, Bora)
I'm rich now, no Wheel of Fortune (I'm rich now, no Wheel of Fortune)
But I was hood rich, had a foreign (Had a Benz, I had a Benz)
Ram couldn't cross, we got it sorted (We got it sorted, same lawyer)
I signed my deal like I forged it (I signed my deal like I forged it)
New mansion, what's the mortgage? (What's the price? What's the price?)

[Chorus: Ramriddlz]
I only pull up in black trucks
Step out with bad sluts
Walk in smoking magma
Puff puff, give me asthma
Got so much ass, ma
Wide like plasma
White bitch like Ivana
Think I'm sweet like anana
[Verse 3: Ramriddlz]
Used to take the go to go to school (Yeah I used to bus down)
Yeah I had no hoes, had no jewels (Now I'm all bust down)
No one showed at shows like I wasn't cool (Now they all shut down)
Yeah I'm bout to blow, yeah I'm gone bust now
You know I came a long way
Back in the day stole polo from The Bay
Now I'm on my way up
They were lol-ing in my face, now I'm balling, got my cake up
Oh, now I got Masari (Feloos)
Ever seen a Ram rolling in a 'Rari?
I got your shawty (She's on the loose)
Ever seen a Ram pull up to your party? (Skrrt skrrt)1
