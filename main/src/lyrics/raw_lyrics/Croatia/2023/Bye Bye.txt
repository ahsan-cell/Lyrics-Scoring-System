Run, watch me run run
Catch up to me darling
Fall when you fall fall
I’m running with blood on my feet
Need, yeah I needed you
But you were too busy drinking boy what was i thinking
Flash with ya flashing lights
This is when the lights go out
Baby you’re no good for me, I know the truth hurts
I know the truth hurts
This is where the lights go out

[Pre-Chorus]
Coulda stayed with me stayed with me
Coulda loved me loved me baby
Coulda stayed with me stayed with me
When the lights go out

[Chorus]
Bye bye to you
I ain't gonna be another fool for you
Say bye bye to me
You ain't gonna get my love so easily

[Verse 2]
Go gotta get away
Break away baby
You going down, you
Baby you’re no good for me, i know the truth hurts
Baby I know the truth hurts
This is where the lights go out
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Coulda stayed with me stayed with me
Coulda loved me loved me baby
Coulda stayed with me stayed with me
When the lights go out

[Chorus]
Bye bye to you
I ain't gonna be another fool for you
Say bye bye to me
You ain't gonna get my love so easily

[Bridge]
Bye, bye, bye
This is where the lights go out

[Pre-Chorus]
Coulda stayed with me stayed with me
Coulda loved me loved me baby
Coulda stayed with me stayed with me
When the lights go out

[Chorus]
Bye bye to you
I ain't gonna be another fool for you
Say bye bye to me
You ain't gonna get my love so easily
