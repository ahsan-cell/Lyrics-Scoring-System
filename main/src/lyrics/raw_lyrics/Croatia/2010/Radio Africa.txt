I’m hearing only bad news from Radio Africa

They’ve still got trouble with a monster in the South
Heads buried deep in that lion’s mouth
Like a jaw snapped shut, it keeps them apart
If that jaw got broke, it would be a start

I’m hearing only bad news from Radio Africa
I’m hearing only sad news from Radio Africa

The West still complains about the foreign aid
They’d do better to change the terms of the trade
There’s more tanks than food in the Ogaden
It looks like Moscow got it wrong again

I’m hearing only bad news from Radio Africa
I’m hearing only sad news from Radio Africa
I’m hearing only bad news from Radio Africa
I’m hearing only sad news

Mozambique and Mugabe
Still got FRELIMO I hear them say
But exchange means … (Exchange means)
Recession means … (Recession means)
It all means it’s harder to take
Tanzania could be moving up a gear
Instead they’ve got to step on the brake
