No one knows just what to say
It's like we're in uncharted territory
No one knows the proper way
It's like the ground has fallen from under me

[Pre-Chorus]
And all sensible words
All sensible hearts
Oh, where do they go?
And why do they leave us now?

[Chorus]
And if I could go back again
I'll go back again
If the worst is happening
How does anything work?
Now let me please go back again
I'll go back again

[Verse 2]
No one knows what part to play
It's like we're in uncharted territory
No one knows another way
It's like all grace in life has parted from me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And all sensible words
All sensible souls
Oh, where do they go?
And why do they leave us now?

[Chorus]
And if I could go back again
I'll go back again
If the worst is happening
How does anything work?
Now let me please go back again
I'll go back again

[Bridge]
And all the sensible words
All the sensible hearts
Keep calling for course
A heading or buoy
Could the end be a start?
All sensible souls
Oh, where do they go?
And why do they leave us now?

[Chorus]
And if I could go back again
I'll go back again (I'll go back again, I'll go back again)
If the worst is happening
How does anything work? (Work)
Now let me please go back again
I'll go back again (I'll go back again, I'll go back again)
And if I could go back again
I'll go back again (I'll go back again, I'll go back again)
If the worst is happening
How does anything work? (Work)
Now let me please go back again
I'll go back again (I'll go back again, I'll go back again)
[Outro]
No one knows just what to say
It's like we're in uncharted territory1
