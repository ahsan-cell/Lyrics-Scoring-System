Cruising down lake shore feel the windy breeze
I'm deep up in your tummy but you feel it in your knees
Tell me what you want from me I do just as you please
In the drop top coupe you hair be blowing with the trees
(Baby won't you) slide, slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide (Baby won't you)
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide (Baby won't you)

[Verse]
Bitch i'm feeling good
I might pour a deuce up in a cup or roll a wood
All my niggas from the trenches, yea we from the hood
Imma get this monеy for my niggas like a should
(Shhhhh, be quiet) Imma mind my businеss
I might work that pussy out call it Planet Fitness
All my niggas made it out, God he be my witness
Put the VV's in my mouth I just seen my dentist
(Ahhh okay) Time to count the zeros
I'm the voice up in my city say that they like heroes
Everyday i'm swerving bitches I be doing euros
Want the European money, yes i'm talking Euros
I just be hoping I'm making it out
Niggas be fake and they chasing the clout
Learned how to rap and I figured it out
I'm a real nigga and that's not a doubt
Niggas be hating like what's that about
Went to the north and I came from the south
I see what you bout so i'm taking it down
Sticking it deep and she screaming and shouting
You might also like[Chorus]
Cruising down lake shore feel the windy breeze
I'm deep up in your tummy but you feel it in your knees
Tell me what you want from me I do just as you please
In the drop top coupe you hair be blowing with the trees
(Baby won't you) slide, slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide (Baby won't you)
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide
Slide, slide, slide, slide, slide (Baby won't you)1
