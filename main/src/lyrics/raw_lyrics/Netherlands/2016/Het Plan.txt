He's got a master plan
Standing up in heaven
Urinating on our heads
No matter what you do
Just face it boy, you're screwed
You're gonna go to hell when you die

I'm goin' to hell, I'm goin' to hell
I'm gonna go to hell when I die
There'll be smoke comin' out my ears
And I'll burn a thousand years
Yes, I'm gonna go to hell when I die

He pulls the wings off the flies
While he's makin' up a list
He put us here on earth
So he can smash us all to bits
You will never be free
You might as well give in
You're gonna burn in hell for your sins

I'm goin' to hell, I'm goin' to hell
I'm gonna go to hell when I die
I'll be bacon in the pan
When I reach that fearsome land
Yes, I'm gonna go to hell when I die

He'll meet you at the gate
With lots of circus peanuts
So hurry, don't be late
He'll make you vote Republican
Then shoot you in the head
Oh, Jesus please kill me when you can

I'm goin' to hell, I'm goin' to hell
I'm gonna go to hell when I die
I'll run screamin' down the stairs
With a greasefire in my hair
Pickin' up the soap
In the middle of the air

I'm goin' to hell, I'm goin' to hell
I'm gonna go to hell when I die
There'll by smoke comin' out my ears
And I'll burn ten thousand years
Yes, I'm gonna go to hell when I die
