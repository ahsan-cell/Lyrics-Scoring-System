There's a monster under my bed
We pillow talking

But I don't wanna end up in that same place again

I been doing better, doing better
Been through heavy weather, heavy weather
Never going back, going never
I've been doing better, but I

[Chorus]
I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know whеre I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leavе a little light on

[Verse 2]
A little light on
Sing another song
Come sleepwalk with me till it's dawn
Come sweet talk to me till my heart

Oh, you best believe

And it grows when I forget

[Chorus]
I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on

I am still afraid of the dark
Even though there's a sky full of stars
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm on the run
Can you leave a little light on
[Outro]
A little light on
I've been doing better
Been through heavy weather
Oh, can you leave a little light on
A little light on
