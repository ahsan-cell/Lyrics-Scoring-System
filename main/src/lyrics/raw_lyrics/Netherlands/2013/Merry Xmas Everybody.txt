Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall?
It's the time when every Santa has a ball
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
Does a ton-up on his sleigh?
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

[Hook]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

[Verse 2]
Are you waiting for the family to arrive?
Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
Does your granny always tell ya
That the old songs are the best?
Then she's up and rock 'n' rolling with the rest

[Hook]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun

What will your daddy do when he sees your mama kissing Santa Claus?
A-ha

[Verse 3]
Are you hanging up your stocking on your wall?
Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
Do you ride on down the hillside
In a buggy you have made?
When you land upon your head
Then you bin slayed

[Outro]
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
Look to the future now
It's only just begun
So here it is, Merry Christmas
Everybody's having fun
(It's Christmas!)
Look to the future now
It's only just begun2
