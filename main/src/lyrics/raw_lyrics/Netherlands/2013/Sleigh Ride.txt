Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

[Verse 2]
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling yoo-hoo
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

[Verse 3]
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

[Bridge]
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, let's go
Let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy-up, giddy-up, giddy-up, it's grand
Just holding your hand

[Verse 4]
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy, cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like birds of a feather would be
You might also like[Verse 5]
Let's take the road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you

[Verse 6]
There's a Christmas party at the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop
Pop, pop, pop

[Verse 7]
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy
As they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

[Verse 8]
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
[Outro]
