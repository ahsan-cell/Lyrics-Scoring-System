The chances are we won't be getting snow
But even if the sun shines from now to Christmas Day
As far as i'm concerned, I know.....

It's gonna be a cold, cold Christmas without you
Dreaming of those warm, warm, lazy summer days
It's gonna be a long and lonely Christmas without you
Missing you, my darling, in oh, so many ways

Yesterday I saw your mom and dad
We bought our cards together
I've put the presents on the Christmas tree
And as I write this letter
It's warm, inside, the log fire's burning bright
Oh darling, If only you were here, to make it right

It's gonna be a cold, cold Christmas without you
Dreaming of those warm, warm, lazy summer days
It's gonna be a long and lonely Christmas without you
Missing you, my darling, in oh, so many ways

I didn't bother with the mistletoe
You won't be here to kiss me
The only consolation that I've got
I know for sure you'll miss me
It won't be long until you're home again
And we can share these magic moments, but till then.....

Dreaming of those warm...
