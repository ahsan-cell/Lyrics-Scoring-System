[Verse 1]
Singing bells and snowy streets
All around the world
Happy faces everywhere
But your bed is cold

[Hook]
Embrace yourself like no one else could
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
And oooh you're alone tonight
Oooh no Christmas lights
No kisses, hugs, no love, no luck
Christmas a delight

[Verse 2]
Things will be okay
You'll see you won't be lonely
Maybe next year you and me
Around the Christmas tree
You might also like[Hook]
Embrace yourself like no one else could
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
Being alone at Christmas doesn't have to be a bad thing
Singing songs all for yourself
Some brandy, no one's leaving
And oooh you're alone tonight
Oooh no Christmas lights
No kisses, hugs, no love, no luck
Christmas a delight

[Outro]
We will be alright
