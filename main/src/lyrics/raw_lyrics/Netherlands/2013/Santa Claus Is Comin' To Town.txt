[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town
Santa Claus is comin' to town, yeah
He's making a list, he's checkin' it twice
He's gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

Better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town (Yeah)
