How I wish I that I could only change it
Take the calendar and re-arrange it
Then every day would be so nice
Candy Canes and all the Snow that's fallin
Every summer would be Deck the Hallin
Every day at Christmas comes from me to you
So I pray...And I wait... And I hope that it doesn't come late
Why couldn't it be Christmas everyday
Riding around with Santa on his Sleigh
Don't you know if you'll be good just like you should
You'll here those jingle bell rings
Why couldn't it be Christmas everynight
So that it will meet those twinkling lights
When you say every days a holiday
You'll here those calendars sing
Why couldn't it be Christmas Christmas Christmas everyday
Just believe in Christmas Christmas Christmas all the way
And every time I see your eyes
Their some mistletoe that's right above you
Where the Christmas gifts do say I love you
There some that say it's just a dream
But close your eyes and you can almost see it
All you have to do is just believe it
Maybe there's a stocking full of Christmas Joy
So I pray... and I wait... and I hope that it doesn't come late
Why couldn't it be Christmas everyday
Riding around with Santa on his Sleigh
Don't you know if you'll be good just like you should
You'll here those jingle bell rings
Why couldn't it be Christmas Christmas Christmas everyday
Just believe in Christmas Christmas Christmas all the way
Whatever kind of weather
Summer, Spring and Fall will melt together
Now I can see it clear
That we can make it ...You might also like
