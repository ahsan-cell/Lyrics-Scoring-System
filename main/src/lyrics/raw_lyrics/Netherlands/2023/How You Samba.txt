I've been looking for somebody to love
Somebody to love
Hot nights
Dancing 'til the sweat drippin' off
The sweat drippin' off

[Pre-Chorus: Sofía Reyes]
I see you looking over
I see you come my way
(Oh-eh-oh, oh, oh, oh-eh-oh)
Before I can let you closer
You gotta make me stay

[Chorus: Sofía Reyes]
So, if you want me like, "Ooh, na-na"
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like, "Ooh, la-la"
Come on and show me how you samba
So, if you want me like, "Ooh, na-na"
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like, "Ooh, la-la"
Come on and show mе how you samba

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah & Sofía Reyes]
(Woo!) Yeah
I heard baddies don't blush
For brothеrs, that's cheap
Keepin' it hush, the money on me
There ain't no judgement, gimme instructions
I wanna touch it, rub it and squeeze
Fly to the sun like Icarus (Ah)
Twerk it, shake it, jiggle it (Ah)
Ask this Spice what she really, really on right now
'Cause I really wanna zig-a-zig, ah
Doing the mad ting
You and all of your bad friends
Native tongue and your accent
Come in the section with me (Oh-eh-oh, oh, oh)
You might also like[Chorus: Sofía Reyes & Tinie Tempah]
So, if you want me like, "Ooh, na-na"
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like, "Ooh, la-la"
Come on and show me how you samba (Uh, let's go)
So, if you want me like, "Ooh, na-na"
You better show me that you're the one
Caress my body like, "Ooh, la-la"
Come on and show me how you samba

[Outro: Sofía Reyes]
Come on and show me how you samba1
