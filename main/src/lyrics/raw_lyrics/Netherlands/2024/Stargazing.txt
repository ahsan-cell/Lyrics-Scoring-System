Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Time stood still just like a photograph
You made me feel like this would last forever
Lookin' in your eyes
I see my whole life

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
They say you know it when you know it, and I know
Oh, oh
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go (Hey)

[Chorus]
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I've wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazin'
Intertwinin' souls
We were never strangers
You were right therе all along

[Verse 2]
I lose my mind
When I'm around you, how I come alivе
When I'm without you, I can't help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I've got
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh
They say you know it when you know it, and I know
Oh, oh
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go (Hey!)

[Chorus]
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I've wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazin'
Intertwinin' souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
All along
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I've wasted
You were right there all along
