[verse 3]

Isaac and his mother lived alone in a small house.
Isaac kept to himself, as his mom watched television.
Life was simple, and they were both happy.
That was, until the day Isaac's mom heard a voice.

"Your son Isaac is still corrupt!"
"To prove your faith, I will ask you a sacrifice."
"Go into his room and end his life.
"Your son Isaac will be the sacrifice."

[verse 4]
