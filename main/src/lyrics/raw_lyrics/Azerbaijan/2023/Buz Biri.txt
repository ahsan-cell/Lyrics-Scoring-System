You start to think about the end
(oh, but the curtain's up)
Don't you think that I see you pretend
That you don't give one fuck
Chin down, shoulder's back
(Think if you could have been with a look like that)
Hand down, index up
(Nothing can cover the fact that you're mixed up)
I've listened to what you've said
Still I don't know what's going on in your head
I tried to change your mind
I wouldn't bother, thought it'd be a waste of our time
You Said

Too little too late
I got a feeling in my gut that I'll be irate
Let me get this straight
From me you wanna be extricate
(Go look it up)
From me you wanna be extricate
(Go look it up)
From me you wanna bе extricate
Extricate
Extricatе

We're on a Race To Nowhere
I can see that you don't care
You looked at me you just said "Take me There!" (biri, biri)
You just said "Take me There!"
We're on a Race To Nowhere
I can see that you don't care
You looked at me you just said "Take me There!" (biri, biri)
You just said "Take me There!"

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna be the man to drive his foot
Down to the floor to the brink of -What?-
You don't know what's 'what' when it comes to the mess of our binds that you've now cut
You flipped the tables, unhinged the doors
You've cut the cables, turned out the drawers
You don't begin to know what or why
You don't explain, you don't justify

So I'm left thinking about the darkest thoughts
Of other people's lips
And other people's hips
I replay the same scene of coming home to finding lips squirming in a frenzied fit

I've opened too many doors with signs that say sad salacious sorted in bling
Patience is a virtue, but you're no saint
Wait for your turn to speak
[Chorus]
We're on a Race To Nowhere
I can see that you don't care
You looked at me you just said "Take me There!" (biri, biri)
You just said "Take me There!"
We're on a Race To Nowhere
I can see that you don't care
You looked at me you just said "Take me There!" (biri, biri)
You just said "Take me There!"

[Verse 2]
You just dropped from the brink of a plane with no parachute
Can you respect for me to jump too?
I'd like to think that I could pull off some double-oh status free for rescue
I'm not willing to toe your line
You deal with yours, I shall cope with mine
I looked at our journey ends and caress those ways we could have made amends

I guess I'll just watch you take a bow as the curtain drops
Not even into the second scene when the show just stops
What if they decided that you was stopped in it too?
You don't want me but you need me to stand by you

[Chorus]
We're on a Race To Nowhere
I can see that you don't care
You looked at me you just said "Take me There!" (biri, biri)
You just said "Take me There!"
We're on a Race To Nowhere
I can see that you don't care
You looked at me you just said "Take me There!" (biri, biri)
You just said "Take me There!"
