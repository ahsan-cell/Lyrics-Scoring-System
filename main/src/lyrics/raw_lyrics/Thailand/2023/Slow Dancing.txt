[Verse 1]
It's about time we get it straight
Gimme a minute if it ain't too late
대충 무리였나봐, babe
애먼 기분만 해친 채
버티기가 이만큼 힘든데
Stay with me 'til the end of the day

[Chorus]
Maybe we
Could be
Slow dancing
Until the morning
We could be romancing
The night away

[Verse 2]
Turnin' me up and back off like this
What do you want? Do you not like it?
Stop teasin' me, girl
Now, you made me leave my heart out here
날 딛고 올라가
다시 새로 누군가 (Got it on, did you?)
닮았던 우리가
먼 이웃 같은 날
You might also like[Chorus]
Maybe we
Could be
Slow dancing
Until the morning
We could be romancing
The night away
