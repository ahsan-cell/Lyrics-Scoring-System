Cut down on sitting down
I'm tired of having nothing in my head
I tried to reason with myself and came off better for it
I'm overwhelmed by a sense of apathy
And underwhelmed by any urgency
Why do we do this?
Why do we do this?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so sick of finding out
The things I fixed are broken now
I'm still sick of seeing how
Easy it is to be uninspired

[Chorus]
Don’t need another warning sign
To tell me that we’re losing time
I've grown into this skin of mine
Like every other person I know
And I hope for better days
Late night, hard floorboard pain
I hope we see through the other side
I hope for better than this

[Verse 2]
And I don't feel like I'm slowing down
I'm just sick and tired of burning out
And everyone my age is far ahead
I'm disengaged
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not tired of sleeping on the floor
I'm not blind to think there's something more
I'm not fine but at least I don't ignore
The way we've all still grown
We've all still grown

[Chorus]
Don’t need another warning sign
To tell me that we’re losing time
I've grown into this skin of mine
Like every other person I know
And I hope for better days
Late night, hard floorboard pain
I hope we see through the other side
I hope for better than this

[Bridge]
I'm not tired of sleeping on the floor
I just wanna know when it ends
I'm not tired of sleeping on the floor
I just wanna know when it ends

[Chorus]
Don’t need another warning sign
To tell me that we’re losing time
I've grown into this skin of mine
I've grown into this skin of mine
Don’t need another warning sign
To tell me that we’re losing time
I've grown into this skin of mine
Like every other person I know
And I hope for better days
Late night, hard floorboard pain
I hope we see through the other side
I hope for better than this1
