And this business-
This is a very tough, correct?
This is a very danger business
And danger is my business
And this business
You can't ask
And you can't give any mercy
Right?
Right!
Yeah!

[Chorus]
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the
Do, do the rugged war sh-

[Verse 1]
There's a war goin' on outside and I'm an inhabitant
The Draco in the drawеr, the Primeta up in the cabinеt
Dressed in Dashiki, the Northern city of Nazareth
The Daytona platinum, another level, extravagant
The breath of God, all of the kafir, just a contaminant
They pray to Pagan Gods and they paint a picture of arrogance
You softer than a bitch and unparable, the protagonist
The Mantequilla roll and a rock the size of a batholith
The equilibrium is the basis inside the labyrinth
Call for Jihad, cut off his head and hand him inhabitance
A look inside my mind is too horrible, pa, it's perilous
The Gucci frame is green and the color scheme is asparagus
I put 'em in the kitchen, pa, that's a better cook
Admit you on a lower level, that's a better look
See, it really doesn't matter how you rate our team
I will hit you with a TEC like you Draymond Green, dummy
You might also like[Chorus: Sample Scratching]
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the
Do, do the rugged war sh-

[Verse 2]
God in the words, Subhan Allah, coppin' a bird
Avidity Arms fine, but the Glock is preferred
Pistolera, crystal clear, logic is blurred
These the Gucci Princetown, they're the moccassin's worth
Every rhyme on another level, son is sublime
I will eat these motherfuckers' food one at a time
This bumbaclot (bumbaclot!) not a threat, pa, son is benign
I'm the product of the destruction and thunder combined
I'm a lion and the lion always hungry for blood
You got the mind of a batiman (batiman!), heart of a cub
I'm a mercenary, Rock Island armory snub
This that Dr. Feelgood street pharmacy mug
I think you soft if you think my way of thinkin' is cruel
I will have his jaw wired, he'll be drinkin' his food
How you think you're number one? Don't know how to win
How you say that you a shark? Don't know how to swim
Dummy!
[Chorus]
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the rugged war shit
The-the, the-the-the
Do, do the rugged war sh-

[Outro]
This is a very danger business
And danger is my business
And this business
You can't ask
You can't give any mercy
Right?
Right!
