Baby, you're like candle light
You're swaying in my line of sight (Ooh-ooh)
Don't get comfortable
Don't you break my fall
I like letting things fly
Like a bowling ball
I won't hit a wall if you get it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you wait outside?
Will you wait for me?
Are you on the dark side of the street?
Yeah, I hide my eyes
So I don't seem weak
Say the moon is blinding me

[Chorus]
Electricity when you brush me aside
I'm getting in control then get my hands tied away
Brush me aside
You make me dizzy like sweet cyanide
Brush me aside
I'm getting in control thеn get my hands tied away
Brush me asidе
You make me dizzy like sweet cyanide
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'm playing, I'm chasing traffic lights (Ooh-ooh)
Feel safe when I'm holding dynamite (Ooh-ooh)
Don't get comfortable
Don't you break my fall
I like letting things fly
Like a curtain call
I'll give you one more
If you give applause every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Will you wait outside?
Will you wait for me?
Are you on the dark side of the street?
Yeah, I hide my eyes
So I don't seem weak
Say the moon is blinding me

[Chorus]
Electricity when you brush me aside
I'm getting in control then get my hands tied away
Brush me aside
You make me dizzy like sweet cyanide
Brush me aside
I'm getting in control then get my hands tied away
Brush me aside
You make me dizzy like sweet cyanide
[Post-Chorus]
Cyanide
You make me dizzy like sweet cyanide

[Outro]
Brush me aside
You make me dizzy like sweet cyanide
