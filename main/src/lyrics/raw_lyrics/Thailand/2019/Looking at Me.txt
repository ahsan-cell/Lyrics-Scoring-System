I like the way you walk to me
Way you talk to me
Everything you do is something that I need
Why you so mean?
Baby, it's me
And I know nothing in this life come for free
Nothing in this life is easy
Nothing good comes so straight like that
You got an attitude
I know it’s a facade though
See you on the spot with your home girls
Every guy line up and you say no
What are you waiting for?
Somebody to give a little more

[Pre-Chorus]
I understand that
No ring on your hand yet
That mean now you free and I want you off of the market
Today, we'll see you on a Sunday
Let's keep it a hundred
No need, no club, no dress, no makeup
To see that you real, yeah
A real one, you a real one
You the type I like
That Sunday morning type
When there’s nothing to do 'cause we did it last night
You know it's real and I feel
You might also like[Chorus]
When I wanna see you on a Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped, yeah
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe
Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe

[Verse 2]
You could be anywhere
You could do anything
But you're here with me shawty, yeah
Let’s sit and do nothing ’til it turn into something
Clear the whole day for you
Hol' up, hol’ up, hol' up
In the crib singing New Freezer, yeah
Hungry, we looking at menus to eat from
Binge watch everything on Netflix
Power Sundays girl, it's a blessing
Oh, it's just me and you when nothing else to do
I’m just glad to be with you, oh baby
Because I want someone to chill and talk with
Superbad and it's never awkward
Nothing poppin', we chill regardless
Feel so good to have an accomplice
On Sunday, yeah please don't be afraid of it
You don't know until you try
[Pre-Chorus]
And I understand that
No ring on your hand yet
That mean now you free and I want you off of the market
Today, we'll see you on a Sunday
Let's keep it a hundred
No need, no club, no dress, no makeup
To see that you real, yeah
A real one, you a real one
You the type I like
That Sunday morning type
When there's nothing to do 'cause we did it last night
You know it's real and I feel

[Chorus]
When I wanna see you on a Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped, yeah
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe
Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe

[Bridge]
You really the type I would give all of my time to
You know that it's real when in the morning I still want you
So skip a couple classes, girl you already passin'
I love it when I got you no distractions
[Chorus]
That's why I hit you Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe
Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe
Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped, yeah
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe
Sunday, yeah
Girl, don't get me hyped
My type, my type, my type
On Sunday, it's a different vibe
