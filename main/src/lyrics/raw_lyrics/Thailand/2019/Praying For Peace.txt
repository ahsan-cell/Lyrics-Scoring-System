I only talk facts so they'll never disagree
I'm a king to you nigga y'all bow for the boy
My lines in the bowl niggas eat it like it's cereal
I'm poisoning the river I'm about to kill the flow
Wait straight to the content

Voices in my head they be louder than an siren
I done hurt many bitchies so I tell em sorry
I always told my mama that I'm gonna make her proud
I always had a wish of buying her a big house
And now then she's gone so I'll have to buy a tombstone damn I'm so paralyzed


Everyday I was down on my knees praying for peace
Lord forgive me for my sins
All the things that I did,I did it 'coz I didn't know me
I was lost in the darkest state I couldn't see the light but I never gave up on myself
I used to feed the monster now the beast is unleashed
In the jungle I'm a leader of a pack
You a bee with no stinger you just gotta drop dead Lil nigga

Had a broken heart but I still showed love
Caught up in my feelings
With an broken wing but I still flew out
Like the ghost rider yeah I had nobody
Reality fading
Faking is real but then realness never fake
Bathi indoda ayikhali but we all have feelings
You might also likeTears are lite but they carry heavy feelings
Aligning stars like I'm moving chess pieces
Still searching for the price of a living
Still searching for the price of freedom
