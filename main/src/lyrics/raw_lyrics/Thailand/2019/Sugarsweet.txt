Ooh, that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Sippin' on the potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repeat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion

[Verse 1]
Live it up, live it up, live it up sweet emotion
'Cause every time, every night, you and I on a roll
Switch it up, switch it up, switch it up where I'm going
Stay on the fly, just in time, know the right way to go

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on the road it's my time
Taking control of my life
I want to run the red lights
I've got to run this show
You always take me so high
You always make the highlights
I love the way we vibe, vibe
You're like a centerfold
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Sippin' on thе potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repеat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion
Ooh, that sugar

[Verse 2]
All I want, all I want, all I want is satisfaction
Make a move, baby, you got nothing to lose
Give me that, give me that, give me that good reaction
Gonna make it right a little like an offer I can't refuse

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on the road it's my time
Taking control of my life
I want to run the red lights
I've got to run this show
You always take me so high
You always make the highlights
I love the way we vibe, vibe
You're like a centerfold
[Chorus]
Ooh, that sugar sweet
You got what I need
Sippin' on the potion
All that good emotion
Just my kinda heat
Keep it on repeat
Testify the motion
Lovin' this devotion
Ooh, that sugar

[Post-Chorus]
