Did I really just forget that melody?
Naw, nana, bananana, nanananananana (Nana, ah-ah)
Alright, dada, dadadada

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
(How I stride like that)

[Verse 1: bbno$]
Amex, no cap, eight hundred score
They wonder how (How I guap like that)
I rap my lyrics when I perform
They wonder how (How I stride like that)
Married to the grind, I brought my ring
I'm corny, but your girly want the dick
Modest with my jewels, but check the bank
Finally got the money, say my thanks
You might also like[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
(How I stride like that)

[Verse 2: bbno$]
Haha, I'm at the bank again
They wonder how (How I guap like that)
Pink whip with flames all on the side
They wonder how (How I stride like that)
Got that Gucci on my body, now she tryna pipe me, woo
Popped a Lucy, loosey-goosey, sussy boy, I keep you cool
Got the paper, went to school
Be careful who you callin' fool, ayy, ha, ayy

[Chorus: bbno$]
When I popped off then your girl gave me just a little bit of lockjaw
Baby so cold, he from the north, he from the Canada
Bankroll so low, I got nothing else that I can withdraw
Ran out the door
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
I shine my wrist, it go like shashasha, shashasha
I got your bitch singing, lalalala, lalala
(How I stride like that)65
