Weighed down by morning
In my birthday suit
Lift up the evening
Just for a while
Backwards, upside down and inside out
So hold on or we’ll all fall down
Oh, heave the oceans do
Won’t you?

[Outro]
I’ll keep my ears on
I’ll keep my eyes open
I’ll keep my legs in sight
And wait till we all fall downYou might also like12
