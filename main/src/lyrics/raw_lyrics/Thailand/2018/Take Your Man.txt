Why you coming at me with an attitude? (Huh?)
Slapping on my ego, now I'm mad at you (Shoo)
Now I gotta do what I gotta do (Hmm)
Kinda sad, don't even like the dude

[Pre-Chorus]
Not Mickey D's, but he's lovin' it (Lovin' it)

Call him Arby's 'cause he has the meat (The meat)
Pipe down, girl, better take a seat (A seat)

I can take your mans if I want to (Want to)
But lucky for you, I don't want to (Want to)
