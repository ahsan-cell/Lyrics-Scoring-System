I'm your shotgun, baby, for the long run
Don't you know I'd die for you?
I ride for you

[Verse 1]
Sin City (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Baby, come with me (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
I can sit pretty (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
On your famous leather seats
Flashing lights (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Put it into drive (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Up and down my thighs (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
I'm your favorite fantasy

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel my heartbeat? (Can you feel my heartbeat?)
When you hit it full speed (When you hit it full speed)
Anywhere you take me (Anywhere you take me)
I'll go (I'll go)

[Chorus]
I'm your shotgun, baby, for the long run
Don't you know I'd die for you?
I ride for you
Say you're all mine, touch me under streetlights
Don't you know I'd die for you?
I ride for you

Yeah, I know you want it (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
Bumper sticker on it (Uh, uh-uh-uh)
I'm your babygirl on board

[Pre-Chorus]
Can you feel my heartbeat? (Can you feel my heartbeat?)
When you hit it full speed (When you hit it full speed)
Anywhere you take me (Anywhere you take me)
I'll go (I'll go)

[Chorus]
I'm your shotgun, baby, for the long run
Don't you know I'd die for you?
I ride for you
Say you're all mine, touch me under streetlights
Don't you know I'd die for you?
I ride for you

[Outro]
I'm your passenger, I'm your passenger princess
Passenger, I'm your passenger princess1
