I know what you did last night
I called you up and you declined
I smell perfume, but it ain't mine
It's not okay, but it's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you telling so many lies, I gotta let you go
Now you know what it's like to be all alone
Tell me, how you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most?
'Cause your tears gon' cry a river, go, let it flow

[Chorus]
Don't want no cry baby at my door, I'll let him go
Boy, I ain't the same girl I was before
You're only crying 'cause I don't want you back no more
Boy, you had your chance
And you can keep on cryin', baby

[Post-Chorus]
I know you been lyin', baby
So you can keep on cryin', baby

[Verse 2]
I don't know what you're waiting for
I packed your bags outside the door, uh
No, I don't wanna sit and talk
Can you hurry up? I'm bored

'Cause you telling so many lies, I gotta let you go, mm
Now you know what it's likе to be all alone
Tell mе, how you gonna hurt the one that loves you the most? Yeah, 'cause your tears gon' cry a river, go, let it flow

[Chorus]
Don't want no cry baby at my door, I'll let him go
Boy, I ain't the same girl I was before (No, I ain't the same)
You're only crying 'cause I don't want you back no more (I don't want you back)
Boy, you had your chance (Ha-ha)
And you can keep on cryin', baby

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh)
I know you been lyin', baby
(Oh-oh, mm)
So you can keep on cryin', baby

[Outro]
You can keep on cryin', baby boy
I know you been
I know you been lyin', baby
So you can keep on cryin', baby
