Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her

[Verse 1]
My heart is heavy now, it's like a hundred pounds
It's fallin' faster than the way you love to shut me down
I think I need a shower, my friends are takin' shots
You think it's happy hour, for me, it's not

[Chorus]
Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
Don't smile becausе it happened, baby
Cry becausе it's over
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)

[Verse 2]
Pour my feelings in the microphone
I stay in, and when the girls come home
I want one of them to take my phone
Take my phone and lose your
Number, I don't wanna be tempted
Pick up when you wanna fall back in
You can fake it, but you know I know
Know I know

Don't smile because it happened, baby (Don't, oh)
Cry because it's over (No, mm, no, no)
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her (Mm)
Don't smile because it happened, baby
Cry because it's over (Ooh)
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)
Oh, you're supposed to think about me
Every time you hold her
(I want you to miss me, I want you to miss me)6
