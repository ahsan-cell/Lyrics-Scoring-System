I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I've never speak
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watchin' the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew, ooh
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man, I'm, I'm just a man

[Pre-Chorus]
No more thinkin' about you late night
No more runnin' around with your friends now
Done pickin' up pieces of my
Soul up off the floor, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't play this gamе no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight I saved my lifе when I showed you the door

You never thought this day would ever come
But I looked you in the eyes and pulled the rug
You tried to take away my sanity
Baby, that ain't for me, that, that ain't for me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no more thinkin' about you late night
No more runnin' around with your friends now
Done pickin' up pieces of my
Soul up out the floor, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby
But I can't take this game no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door

[Post-Chorus]
When I showed you the door
When I showed you the door
But tonight I saved my life
[Chorus]
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willin'
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't wanna lose you, baby (I don't wanna lose you, baby)
But I can't take this game no more (No more)
I thought it would kill me (I thought it would kill me)
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door

[Outro]
Mm-mm-mm
Woah, oh, oh
