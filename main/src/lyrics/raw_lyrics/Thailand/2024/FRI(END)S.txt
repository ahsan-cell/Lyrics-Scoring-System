(Friends)
Ooh

[Verse 1]
You're in my head
I had plans for the weekend (Ah)
But wound up with you instead (Ah)
Back here again (Oh)
Got me deep in my feelings
When I should be in your bed (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever
And you were there my lonely nights, yeah
Keeping me together
So wouldn't it make sense if I was yours?
And you could call me your baby
But we say we're just, say we're just

[Chorus]
Friends, just for now
Yeah, but friends don't say words that
Make friends feel like more than just
Friends, just for now (Just for now)
Now, I'm over pretending
So let's put the "end" in friends
You might also like[Verse 2]
Friends are not supposed to get too close
And feel emotions that
We're feeling now, now, now
We ain't slowing down, down, down (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But once we cross the line
There's no denying you and
I can never turn around, 'round, 'round
Know we'll never be the same (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I go back to like '09, it's like forever
And you were there my lonely nights, yeah
Keeping me together
So wouldn't it make sense if I was yours?
And you could call me your baby
But we say we're just, say we're just

[Chorus]
Friends, just for now
Yeah, but friends don't say words that
Make friends feel like more than just
Friends, just for now
Now, I'm over pretending
So let's put the "end" in friends (Let's put the "end")
Friends, just for now (Ooh)
Yeah, but friends don't say words that
Make friends feel like more than just (Let's put the "end")
Friends, just for now
Now, I'm over pretending
So let's put the "end" in friends
[Outro]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
