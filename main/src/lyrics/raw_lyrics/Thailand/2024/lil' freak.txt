(She freaky)
She a lil' freak, she on me
(Yeah, she freaky)
She a lil' freak, she for the streets
(Ah, freak out)

[Verse 1]
Six diggies' on the check, took it to the bank
Commas after commas, make ya boy— (Freak out)
Got a ten comin' over, only me to thank
Shootin' blanks on a blank, make a girl— (Freak out)
My wrist AP-sy, pearls can't please me
Sounding too easy, I'ma— (Freak out)
I stay creamy, pockets so dreamy, shawty wanna freak me, okay (Freak out)

[Chorus]
(She freaky)
She a lil' freak, shе on me (Ah, freak out)

She a lil' freak, she for the streets (Ah, freak out)

Neck got green rocks, Frankenstein
Makes sense and none at the same time
You MC Squared, I'm Einstein
I'm the new Johnny Cash the way I walk the line
'Course my boys gon' stay this rich
Miami chillin' got a will like Smith
Visa card maxed out, brand-new fits
And my dick got her cheesin' 'cause I'm semi-Swiss (Ah, freak out)
Got the aphrodisiac rhino
Head game crazy, she a goddamn psycho
No FaceTime sex, this a slideshow
Ten toes down got me dodging all the 5-0
She thick like Cinderella pumpkin
Come on over, baby, home alone it Mr. Culkin
King cobra, way I'm bulkin'
Poppin' out a sweat at the gym, got your shawty convulsing

[Chorus]
(She freaky)
She a lil' freak, she on me (Ah, freak out)
(Yeah, she freaky)
She a lil' freak, she for the streets (Ah, freak out)
(She freaky)
She a lil' freak, she on me (Ah, freak out)
(Yeah, she freaky)
She a lil' freak, she for the streets (Freak out)
[Verse 3]
Blowin' me down like a wind force gale
Her ship left, boy, that shit's sailed
Don't talk money, I read it Braille
Baby so krill like I'm the whale
She aching on my clay with her hands like it's pottery
Yeah, I'm freaky, think I love her, yeah I might need a lobotomy
(Freak, freak)
Swallow me, gobble me, all of me
Poseidon in the pussy got me feeling like "The Odyssey"
Feeling like a 50 Cent in a candy shop
Now she tryna' lick my lollipop (Freak)
Got pussy on my tongue and it cost a lot
You might talk the talk, but I walk the walk (Freak)
Come on, pink coop like Anderson
Thirty-five mil' this year, Wes Banderson (Freak out)
RuneScapin' on these hoes got Adamant
She a F-R-E-A-K, I'm abstinent

[Chorus]
(She freaky)
She a lil' freak, she on me (Ah, freak out)
(Yeah, she freaky)
She a lil' freak, she for the streets (Ah, freak out)
(She freaky)
She a lil' freak, she on me (Ah, freak out)
(Yeah, she freaky)
She a lil' freak, she for the streets (Freak out)
[Outro]
(Freak, freak, freak)
(Ah, freak out)
(Freak, freak, freak)
(Ah, freak out)
(Freak, freak, freak)
(Ah, freak out)
(Freak, freak, freak)
She a lil' freak, she for the streets
