Opened up my journal to a page
Everything that hurts me's still the same
Feels like there's nothing new for me to say
Why, why, why?
Why, why, why?
Sweating through the sheets, shakin' in bed
Visions of her naked in my head
But I went off and chose myself instead
Why, why, why?
Ease my mind

[Chorus]
I don't know why, I
I don't know, I don't know why
Why, why, why

[Verse 2]
I stepped off the stage with nothing left
All the lights were fuckin' with my head
But here I am, singing songs again
Why, why, why?
Ease my mind

[Chorus]
I don't know why, I
I don't know, I don't know why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why

Feels like everything goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round it goes
Feels like everything goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round it

[Bridge]
Thought I was about to be a father
Shook me to the core, I'm still a kid
Sometimes I still cry out for my mother
Why, why, why?
Why, why, why?

[Chorus]
I don't know why, I
I don't know, I don't know why
Why, why, why
Why, why, why

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like everything goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round it goes
Feels like everything goes 'round and 'round
And 'round and 'round and 'round it goes3
