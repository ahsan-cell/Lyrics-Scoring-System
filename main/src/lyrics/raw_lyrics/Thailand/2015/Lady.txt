This is for the hustlers...

[Chorus: DJ DMD x 2]
Call me Mr. 25-8
25 hours 8-days straight
Gotta hustle like I'm moving big weight
Got my grind on playa don't hate

[Verse One: DJ DMD]
I'm DMD and I'ma hustler 25 hours a day
8 days a week, all work no play
First one on the scene and last to leave
And if it's money on the block, ya'll best believe
That I'm right up in the mix, always on my grind
I gots to stack chips if I'm ever gon' shine
And blind these haters with some diamond rings
A playa grindin', tryna have the finer things
Plush SUVs forget the grain I want oak
The first man to buy my mama a mink coat
And a pink boat, so she can sail the 7 seas
Come down so hard the laws think I'm movin keys
But I slang raps, like a dealer slang crack
A billion in the bank is what I aim at
I gotta name that'll fit me, describes me to the T
For now on ya'll can call me

Call me Mr. 25-8
25 hours 8-days straight
Gotta hustle like I'm moving big weight
Got my grind on playa don't hate

[Verse Two: DJ DMD]
Now my mama told me to hustle and never give up
Work hard and have faith and you'll be livin' it up
Count your blessings, remember who you love in life
Keep it real with yourself, try hard to do right
And everything'll be gravy, she ain't wrong
That's why when I get on, I'ma get her a home
Cause she deserve it, mama is a hustler too
Shoulda seen what we struggled through
That's why I gots to grind like I do
To take care of my kids
Make a mill with my friends
Knockoff big Benz and
Get a 50 room mansion for me and my babies
Puttin' 25-karats on my lady
I hustle like crazy and represent for all my dogs
As well as all of ya'll who wanna ball, like me
An everyday all day G, for now on ya'll can call me

[Chorus: DJ DMD x 2]
Call me Mr. 25-8
25 hours 8-days straight
Gotta hustle like I'm moving big weight
Got my grind on playa don't hate
[DJ DMD talking]
That's right this one here goin' out
To everybody out there puttin' it down
Makin' sure you take care of your business
So it don't matter if you a lawyer, doctor
Nurse, janitor, athlete, or MC like myself
If you grindin' here's your new name

[Verse Three: DJ DMD]
Now you can find me in the studio daily
Wide open like a brand new baby
I'm on a mission for the fancy cars
Bank account 0'ed up
Boppers in my way, tell 'em quick hold up
Put the work down, come up and come clean
Put my babies in a Jag when they turn 16
And I mean that, I wanna be in the change
For real, ya'll remember the name

[Chorus: DJ DMD x 4 until fade out]
Call me Mr. 25-8
25 hours 8-days straight
Gotta hustle like I'm moving big weight
Got my grind on playa don't hate
