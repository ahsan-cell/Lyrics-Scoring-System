You are my omega
You are my omega

[Verse 1: ROSALÍA]
You and I lost among poppies
Your eyes shine, they are two guns
Our tongues embrace, they're no longer alone
In my memory, you've shot me down
I no longer drink, I no longer smoke
I don't consume and I presume it
You are the best
And before you, I was the worst

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Ralphie Choo]
I've become sentimental
(You are my omega)
Before I make you finish (Eh)
(You arе my omega)

[Verse 2: Ralphie Choo]
And the further away you go, yеah
Everything about you reminds me of you
And the further you move away
Everything about you reminds me
I'm from everywhere, and my crew's got my back
If I'm not who I want to be, God save me
I can be Céline Dion and a hustler
I can be Céline Dion and a hustler

I've become sentimental (Eh)
(You are my omega)
Before I make you finish  (Eh)
(Tell me that you care, you care, you care)

[Interlude: ROSALÍA & Ralphie Choo]
What you li—
Uh-uh-uh
What you like—
Uh-uh-uh
Uh-uh-uh
You tell me that—
You tell me that you care, you care, you care
It's been a long time since I met you
What you like—
It wasn't here, it wasn't here
You care, you care, you care
You care, you care, you care

[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Ralphie Choo]
I give myself the freedom (Eh)
(Tell me that you care, you care, you care)
I am yours without question
(Tell me that you care, you care, you care)
(You care, you care, you care)
[Outro: ROSALÍA]
I've reached the finish
Where everything starts over
You are my omega, you are my omega
No god can erase what’s written by me
Tell me that you care, you care, you care
You are my omega, you are my omega
You care, you care, you care
What you like—
