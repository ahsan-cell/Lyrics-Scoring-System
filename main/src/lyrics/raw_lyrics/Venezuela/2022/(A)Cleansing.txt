Imperfect, decaying
The one true eternal
Draining from within
Between two worlds, a cleansing
Phantom plague, ravaged souls
Deathly secretion in misery
Conceiving blackened energy
Laid barren upon the coil
Veil of tribulation, paradigm of servitude
Lies in a state of infinite matter
Waves of interplanetary destruction
Fragmented organisms, absorbed, disposed
Horde of apparitions, forgotten glimpse
Spectral visions illuminate
Emptiness resides in bottomless depths
Nocturnal senses resonate
A conquered world, untamed
Omen of darkened sky, a prophecy fulfilled
Traces of cosmic unrest
Across realms in decayYou might also like
