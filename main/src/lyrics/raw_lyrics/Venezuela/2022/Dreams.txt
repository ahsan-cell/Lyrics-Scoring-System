Trynna ascend that's my mojo
The only thing I follow
My spirit my heart and the sorrow
Highs Highs and Low Lows
Trynna ascend that's my mojo
The only thing I follow
My spirit my heart and the sorrow

Dead Angels around me
Keep whispering
I'm lost in a breezy place
Excuse me
Did I really leave
Might have died on the scene
Feels like a bad dream
I'm no more breathing

Countin' up zombies
Roller Coasters up in my head
Feeling blue, green, red
This b* do my dance
Now it's time to repent
I'm the fastest in this race
In this game I levitatе
And I'm stuck in my head
Been trill to my sake
You might also likeShe chosе me
She knows how to fly
How to ride
Call me
If you stand on my side
This my life

Highs Highs and Low Lows
Trynna ascend that's my mojo
The only thing I follow
My spirit my heart and the sorrow
Highs Highs and Low Lows
Trynna ascend that's my mojo
The only thing I follow
My spirit my heart and the sorrow

I intrigue them
Cause I'm getting to this place
Where nobody goes
And nobody knows
How much my mind flows
What do you want to do
I still got nun' to lose
I'm followed by shadows

She chose me
She knows how to fly
How to ride
Call me
If you stand on my side
This my life
She chose me
She knows how to fly
How to ride
Call me
If you stand on my side
This my life

I saw em in the sky
I'm landing outside

I've been in a feeling
Drops down tearing
I don't want the billi
I'm chasing trill
They say I'm tripping
I'm high off living
Seen colors speaking
I took no pills
Seen people flying
It's a hell of a feeling
I'm stuck in my dreams
Stuck in my dreams
Seen people crying
Seen people dying
Seen people lying
Seen people striving
Dead Angels around me
Keep whispering
I'm lost in a breezy place
Excuse me
Did I really leave
Might have died on the scene
Feels like a bad dream
I'm no more breathing
