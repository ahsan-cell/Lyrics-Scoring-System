Uh, uh and I like it like that
How you icy like that?
She don't try me like
1 for 10, we strike back
He ain't even like that
Spent 'bout 35 racks, just to be shinin' like that
Uh, uh and I like it like that
How you icy like that?
She don't try me like
1 for 10, we strike back
He ain't even like that
Spent 'bout 35 racks, just to be shinin' like that

[Verse 1]
Bad bitch from Lauderdale
She got a lot of body and she got a lot of hair
Girl, I'm tryna lodi dodi, ain't no romance up in here
Oh, that's a lot of body, bring my gangsters up in here
Tell her come through, bring some food and get up outta here
I'm a foreign boy, diamond teeth, plus a Cartier
I'm from Florida, Miami Heat, she think that I'm a player
I ain't on the team, I keep that heat for any fucking hater
Bouncin' on my meat, she make me skeet, I need a perculator
I'mma see you later, then it's skrt skrt on anybody, Glock came with a laser
She don't hurt 'bout anybody, shawty gettin' paper
I'm like nah, this ain't Ricky Bobby, racin' to that paper
You might also like[Chorus]
Uh, uh and I like it like that
How you icy like that?
She don't try me like
1 for 10, we strike back
He ain't even like that
Spent 'bout 35 racks, just to be shinin' like that
Uh, uh and I like it like that
How you icy like that?
She don't try me like
1 for 10, we strike back
He ain't even like that
Spent 'bout 35 racks, just to be shinin' like that

[Verse 2]
Ain't no slow motion, baby
I'm in whole motion, baby
This a whole ocean, baby
She like, "Go, go crazy"
I get more-more [?]
I ain't God, I cannot save it
I might rob if I don't make it, but I won't starve, I'm bringin' bacon
And bringin' cheese baby, I keep cheesin' 'cause out here they tryna murder me
Soldier keep on cuttin' up, like he doin' surgery
They kept gasin' shawty up and he got hit wit' 93, wit' 93
[Chorus]
Uh, uh and I like it like that
How you icy like that?
She don't try me like
1 for 10, we strike back
He ain't even like that
Spent 'bout 35 racks, just to be shinin' like that
Uh, uh and I like it like that
How you icy like that?
She don't try me like
1 for 10, we strike back
He ain't even like that
Spent 'bout 35 racks, just to be shinin' like that
