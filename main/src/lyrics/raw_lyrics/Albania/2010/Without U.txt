[Verse 1]
My life don't make sense without you
So please baby live for me
Be strong, love and stay alive
Girl, I love you so much
I will be there baby where you are
Even you don't want this, girl
But to live a life without you
Means to be lonely

[Chorus]
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Never thought you'd be out of these arms
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Never thought you'd be out of these arms

[Verse 2]
I gotta find another now
But you, I will not forget
Our love gonna stay alive
Girl, I love you so much
I will try to be myself
Even at this moment i can't
Cause to live a life without you
Means to be lonely
You might also like[Chorus]
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Never thought you'd be out of these arms
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Never thought you'd be out of these arms

[Bridge]
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha

[Chorus]
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Never thought you'd be out of these arms
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Xhane xhane tu raxha
Never thought you'd be out of these arms
[Outro]
Out of these arms
