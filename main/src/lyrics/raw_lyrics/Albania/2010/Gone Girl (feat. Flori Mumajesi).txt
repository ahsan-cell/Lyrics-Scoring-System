[Chorus: Flori Mumajesi]
My baby's gone, my life is over
'Cause I wanna be there for you
When you're gone, my life is over
That should've be the same
My baby's gone, my life is over
Even though I was bad for you
Life is long it can't be over
Yeah, yeah
My baby's gone, my life is over
'Cause I wanna be there for you
When you're gone, my life is over
That should've be the same
My baby's gone, my life is over
Even though I was bad for you
Life is long it can't be over
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: 2po2]
Kish mujt me kan e thjeshte, jeta sdon filozofi
Kur dy njerez duhen, mes tyne ka kimi
T'jesh a po mos t'jesh 1000 here e kum ni
Senet i kum dit vec jom bo kishe spi di
Kum thon leht harroj, e pranoj
Egon tem t'madhe s'kum besu qe e largoj
Se kum prit qe keq kaloj
Kom menu qe t'zavendsoj
Syn, prej qe ke shku ti kurgjo nuk o mo nisoj
Une pa ty, njo e dyta edhe kjo formule e vjeter
Sjom komplet mungon edhe gjysma tjeter
Pendimin tem sot per ty e qita n'leter
E nese kthehesh fjalet kan mu kthy n'veper
Yeah, me sy n'telefon
Po e pres thirrjen teme kur pe qon
Mshelem dry vec vet me ni dhome
Zakonisht kajna masit bohet vone

[Verse 2: 2po2]
Eh, du mu shpreh ti pom mungon
Aroma jote perreth meje egziston
Harroj qe s'je, shpesh e thirri eminin tond
So ka ma nin per kurgjo, jeta pa ty nuk po shkon
Yeah, me sy n'telefon
Po e pres thirrjen teme kur pe qon
Mshelem dry vec vet me ni dhome
Zakonisht kajna masit bohet vone
[Bridge: Flori Mumajesi]
I kam humbur syte duke mos t'pa
E kam humbur gjumin
I kam humbur duarte duke mos te prek
Kam arritur fundin
Te lutem me kujto-o-oh, oh-oh-oh
Se me ke dashte
Dhe mos e harro-o-oh, oh-oh-oh
Ne kemi qene bashke
