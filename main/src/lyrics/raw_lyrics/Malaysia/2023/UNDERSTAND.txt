Never thought that I'd find
That the one in my life would be so near
And now you're here
I got you, you got me
When it's us, babe, you make me feel complete
You're all I need

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands

[Verse 2]
So I guess that it's time
I asked you to be mine for all my days
I hope you'll stay
I'll admit that I'm scared
'Cause I've never really cared as much as this
It's worth the risk

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
Maybe we can try it if you let me
Take you by the hand
You're the only one who understands
Ooh, ooh-ooh
