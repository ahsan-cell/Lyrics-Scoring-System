[Verse]
I could kill em' wit' my eyes close, blind folds
Bite flows, west coast, no hoes all day, you know
See, im runnin this rapgame they call me skywalker
Call me the jedi, them bars like light saber
Ego so high they talk like they do better
You got them tats on your back
Say you deserve them four letters
I be reppin' Damansara
Macam dato' dah bersara
Kasi semua telinga darah
Cakap slow slow
Jangan Bo-bo
Woah
Ada miskin ada kaya
Ada betul ada salah
Ada menang ada kalah
Ada hari aku sihat ada hari aku parah
Underrated, Uneducated, urelated
Sayin I made it
But I ain't cos' I'm underrated
Yeah yeah
This music I express
These people they obsess
I talk on that mic then I make sure I impress
Get what I want then I know that I'm blessed
Uh, uh uh, uh
Too many hearts she can't tell which is mine
Dive in too deep breaking hearts everytime
Scars in the inside, outside lookin' fine
Speakin' the truth they claim that shit a crime now
Three a songs a day, people fuck wit' my rhymes
Life is pathetic when you know its your time
Yea, yea
