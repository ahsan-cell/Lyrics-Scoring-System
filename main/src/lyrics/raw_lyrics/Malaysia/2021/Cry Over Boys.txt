Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
You cry over boys you haven't even met in real life
Yeah, you know he's the worst but you tell all your friends he seems nice, oh, oh
You change like the seasons in LA
And by that I mean that you don't ever really even change
No, you just cry over boys you haven't even met in real life
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
How many nights can you spend
Staining your pillow with makeup?
When you're really upset
It's so annoying to take off
Just to do it again
Oh, what's the point in dressing up to be let down?

[Bridge]
Aren't you tired of getting hurt?
Aren't you sick of, of making it worse?

[Verse 2]
You cry over boys you know would never cry about you
He used to light up your room, now your phone is darker than a tattoo, oh, oh
You move like the Earth around the stars
Broken-hearted when you end up in the same place that you start
No, back to crying over boys you know would never cry about you
Oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
How many nights can you spend
Staining your pillow with makeup?
When you're really upset
It's so annoying to take off
Just to do it again
Oh, what's the point in dressing up to be let down?

[Bridge]
Aren't you tired of getting hurt?
Aren't you sick of, of making it worse?

[Refrain]
Yeah, when you gonna learn? (When you gonna learn?)
When you gonna learn?
When you gonna learn (how not to get hurt?)
When you gonna learn?

[Outro]
You cry over boys you haven't even met in real life
Yeah, you know he's the worst
But you tell all your friends he seems nice
