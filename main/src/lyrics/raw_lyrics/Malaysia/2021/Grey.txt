I can't even hide it
I haven’t stopped thinkin' 'bout
Your lips, mmm, your lips, yeah
I’m losin' my mind
It's been too long, I'm missin'
Your kiss, yeah, your kiss

[Pre-Chorus: Corbyn Besson]
You
You've been there through it all
You answered all my calls
Ooh
I can't believe I let you go

[Chorus: Jack Avery]
Tears and slammin' doors
I’m fallin’ out on the floor
Beggin', beggin’, please
You don't want me no more
I never hurt like this before
I'm beggin', beggin’, please
Now every day it rains
And I'm the one to blame
Baby, I walked away
When you came to stay, oh
Now everything's grey

I'm so, so sorry
I know that's not enough, but
It's true, yeah, it's true
I can't believe that I
Thought I could ever live
Without you, yeah, without you, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Zach Herron]
You
You've been there through it all
You answered all my calls
Ooh
I shoulda never let you go

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
Tears and slammin' doors
I'm fallin' out on the floor
Beggin', beggin', please
You don't want me no more
I never hurt like this before
I'm beggin', beggin', please
Now every day it rains
And I'm the one to blame
Baby, I walked away
When you came to stay, oh
Now everything's grey
[Post-Chorus: Daniel Seavey]
Oh, oh
Ooh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Jack Avery & All]
Tears and slammin' doors
I'm fallin' out on the floor
Beggin', beggin', please
You don't want me no more

I'm beggin', beggin', please
Now every day it rains
And I'm the one to blame
Baby, I walked away
When you came to stay, oh
Now everything's grey73
