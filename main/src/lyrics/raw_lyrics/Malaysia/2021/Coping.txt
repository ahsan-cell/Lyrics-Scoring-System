I'm not used to being with somebody with their shit together
Saying sorry actually makes it better
I did things to you I said I'd never
I miss waiting for you in the lobby of your old apartment
Drawing shapes with you into the carpet
Back before the end had even started

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that you're gone
It's my fault
I'm so lost
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Smoking cheap pre-rolls and listening to LANY
Hoping you don't hate me
I know it's lame, but this is how I'm coping without
Inside jokes and places that you'd take me
Bet you probably blame me
I know it's lame, but this is how I'm coping without you

[Verse 2]
I'm the best at getting disappointed by my expectations
Try to read my mind, it's always racing
Damn, I really love to test your patience
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now that you're gone
It's my fault
I'm so lost
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

[Chorus]
Smoking cheap pre-rolls and listening to LANY
Hoping you don't hate me
I know it's lame, but this is how I'm coping without
Inside jokes and places that you'd take me
Bet you probably blame me
I know it's lame, but this is how I'm coping without you
Without you
Without you
Without you (Without you)

[Bridge]
I'm the best at getting disappointed by my expectations
Try to read my mind, it's always racing
Damn, I really love to test your patience

[Chorus]
Smoking cheap pre-rolls and listening to LANY
Hoping you don't hate me
I know it's lame, but this is how I'm coping without
Inside jokes and places that you'd take me
Bet you probably blame me
I know it's lame, but this is how I'm coping without you
Without you
Without you1
