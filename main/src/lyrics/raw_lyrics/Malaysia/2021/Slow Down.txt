[Verse 1: Corbyn Besson]
Oh, I've been lying to myself and I might know why
I miss the way you looked at me before I left New York (Hey)
I’ve been tryin' to find help 'cause I can’t deny
The way that I feel when I'm with you
Oh, I'd do anything to save ya

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Seavey]
I think we need a little California 'cation
We took a shot at this, but maybe we're too wasted
It's hard to swallow, but I know we've gotta chase it, oh

[Chorus: Zach Herron]
Slow down
I think that we just need to slow down, slow down
Turn around
Things were so simple way before now, 'fore now

[Verse 2: Jonah Marais]
See ya, I wanna see ya, uh
I wish you weren’t so far so I could see ya, uh
’Cita, my mamacita
We were comfortable
We didn't understand, but now we know

I think we need a little California ’cation
We took a shot at this, but maybe we're too wasted
It's hard to swallow, but I know we gotta chase it, oh

[Chorus: Zach Herron & Daniel Seavey]
Slow down
I think that we just need to slow down, slow down
Turn around
Things were so simple way before now, 'fore now
Slow down
I think that we just need to slow down, slow down (Need to slow down, slow down, woah)
Turn around
Things were so simple way before now, ’fore now (Things were so simple way before now)
