You better brush it good or we gona fall apart
Don't give me no shortcutting
You have all day & night
I have to satisfy so you better do it right

[Chorus:]
Work
What you're waiting for
Work
Put your back in it
Work
Justa a little more
Work
Sure you're wanting it now
Work
Till your body's hurting
Work
Working hard and long
Work
When you finish that
Work
I want you to go down town
Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up
Go down, go down, go down
Come up, come up, come up
It's what you come to do, just remember that
And don't pick me fruits, you can put them back
You start of working nice, with your big broomstick
Now you're easing back, like you're afraid of brick
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh yes, yes baby, I like the work you do on my yard
You do reel good work yard man
I find you lookin' nervous like you're afraid to fail
Now you're making excuse 'bout your feeling pain
Just don't waste my time cause you'll get me mad
Have a bit down there, that could bite your broomstick hard
Work
What you're waiting for
Work
Put your back in it
Work
Justa a little more
Work
Sure you're wanting it now
Work
Till your body's hurting
Work
Working hard and long
Work
When you finish that
Work
I want you to go down town

[Chorus]
Ladies, you know that if you don't have a yard man
You can't be a hard man
You know what I'm talking about
Guys you know what I'm talking about too, not so?
And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come (x2)
So if a boy want to test you, tell him come, come
And if a man want to test you, tell him come, come
Work, work, work, work, work, x 3
