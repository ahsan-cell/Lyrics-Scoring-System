Cause it's all that I've know
True love is a fairy tale
I'm damaged
So how would I know
I'm scared
And I'm alone
I'm ashamed
And I need for you to know
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
But you can't take back
What you've taken away
Cause I feel you
I feel you, near me
(repeat)
The feeling comes so painfully
And it chills to the bone
Won't let anyone get close to me
I'm damaged as I'm sure that you've known
I'm scared
And I'm alone
I'm ashamed
And I need for you to know
I didn't say all the things that I wanted to say
But you can't take back
What you've taken away
Cause I feel you
I feel you, near me
(repeat)
There is nothing before my soul
And into this fear
Forgiveness for a man
Who is stronger
I was just a little girl
But I can't go back
Can't go back
(x4)
I can't go back
(3X)
I must go on
