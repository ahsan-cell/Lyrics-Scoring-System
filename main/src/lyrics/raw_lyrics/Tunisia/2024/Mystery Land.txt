I could hardly breathe the same
All your wildest dreams
They will set you free
When you follow me today
To a secret-only place
Surreal in your eyes
We've found paradise
And I'm feelin'
And I'm seein'
Believin', we can find it if we run
To a place that we've been long
Ah... oh...
Ah... oh...
I will lead you to
I will walk you through
Just to be with you
In Mystery land
Ah... oh...
Mystery land
Ah...
Just to be with you...
Ah...

Mystery land
Ah...
Just to be with you...
Ah...
Mystery land
Mystery land
I was almost swept away
I could hardly breathe the same
All your wildest dreams
Whey will set you free
When you follow me today
To a secret-only place
Surreal in your eyes
We've found paradise
And I'm feelin'
And I'm seein'
Believin', we can find it if we run
To a place that we've been long
I will lead you to
I will walk you through
Just to be with you
In Mystery land
Ah... oh...
