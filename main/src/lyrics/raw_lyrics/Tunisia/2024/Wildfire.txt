When we touch
Feel your heat
Feel your fire
Holding me
Run away (Run away, run away)
To the flames (To the flames, to the flames)
When I'm with you
Can't be tamed

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my wildfire
You got me burning for your desire
We keep on going till the daylight
We keep on going till the daylight
'Cause you're my wildfire
You got me burning for your desire
We keep on going till the daylight
'Cause you're my wildfire

[Build]
'Cause you're my wildfire
You got me burning for your desire
We keep on going till the daylight

[Drop]
'Cause you're my wildfire
You got me burning for your desire
We keep on going till the daylight
(Keep it coming, yo)
(You got me burning, you got me burning)
(You got me burning, you got me burning)
(You got me burning, you got me burning)
(You got me burning)

[Verse 2]
When we move
I'm ablaze
Catching feelings
Can't explain
Run away (Run away, run away)
To the flames (To the flames, to the flames)
Feel it glowing
Can't be tamed (Yeah)

[Chorus]
'Cause you're my wildfire
You got me burning for your desire
We keep on going till the daylight
'Cause you're my wildfire
'Cause you're my wildfire
You got me burning for your desire
