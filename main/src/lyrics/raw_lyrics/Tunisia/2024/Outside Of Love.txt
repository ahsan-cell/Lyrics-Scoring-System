I don't really understand it
And you don't wanna talk about it
So where do we go now?
What are we doin'?
I can't stand the silence, so deafenin'

[Pre-Chorus]
That look in your eye hits differently
You've come to the point where you don't love me no more
And I can't give you more
Anymore, anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
How do we make it better?
Should we admit that I'm not enough?
I thought we said "forever"?
It's cold on the outside of love
Can we rеignite the fire
Or should wе admit we're givin' it up?
Right now, I don't know why I'm
Cold on the outside of love

[Post-Chorus]
On the outside of love
I'm so cold on the outside of love

I would rather you were happy
Even if that means without me
How long have you felt this? (Mm)
Have I been clueless?
I can't stand the silence, so deafenin'

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm with you, I just feel lonely
There's thoughts in your head that you don't tell me no more (No more, no more)
And I can't give you more
Anymore, anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
How do we make it better?
Should we admit that I'm not enough?
I thought we said "forever"?
It's cold on the outside of love
Can we reignite the fire
Or should we admit we're givin' it up?
Right now, I don't know why I'm
Cold on the outside of love

[Post-Chorus]
(Outside)
On the outside of love (Outside)
Oh, on the outside of love (Outside)
I'm so cold (Outside)
Oh-woah, oh-woah (Outside)
Ooh, woah (Outside)
I'm so cold on the outside of love (Outside)1
