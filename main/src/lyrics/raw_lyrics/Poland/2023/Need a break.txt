Won't you forget me now
Just for an hour or two
I don't want that image of me
Burned into your memory
It won't happen again, I swear
I've heard it before you see
I wanna see what you preach
Turn into reality

[Interlude]
What else can I do?
Or tell you
To make you
Believe

[Verse 2]
Won't you forget me now
Just for an hour or two
Let me destroy myself
It's not like it's something new
You know I just tried to help
That's what you tell yourself
But the truth is way easier than this
You don't like to see my tears
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Feel the heat on my brain
Tell mе does it feel the same to you
Tеll me is it as hot outside?
'Cause I haven't left my head in a while now
I cannot be the only one
Who boils their mind
With guilt and shame for
Things no one knows they've done
I don't think I can escape the pain
I guess

[Chorus]
I need a break
From all these thoughts in my head
Would it help if I bled?
Sweat and tears turning red
And if I gave up halfway
By my side would you stay
Would you love me anyway
Even if I won't be the same

[Verse 3]
Won't you remember me?
By the smile that you once ignored
The one that I couldn't withhold
That now is so rare to see
I hope by the time we meet
It won't be so hard to tell
If the smile that I greet you with
Is the same as the one you know
[Chorus]
I need a break (I need a break)
From all these thoughts in my head
Would it help if I bled?
Sweat and tears turning red
And if I gave up halfway (And if I gave up halfway)
By my side would you stay?
Would you love me anyway
Even if I won't be the same?
I need a break (Break)
From all these thoughts in my head
Would it help if I bled?
Sweat and tears turning red (Sweat and tears)
And if I gave up halfway
By my side would you stay?
Would you love me anyway
Even if I won't be the same?
