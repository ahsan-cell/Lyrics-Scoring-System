Couple of dates, I'm feelin' low, low
Caught in a maze, I can't get out
Don't wanna stay, it's getting so cold
Your love is a drug that can't be found

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I did it all, and I did it all to get to you
'Cause there's nobody else that takes me up the way you do

[Chorus]
You're all I need, come and hit me with the feeling
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up
Your dopamine got me higher than the ceiling
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up
Don't let me go 'cause I want it every weekend
Heart sped up, h-h-heart spеd up
Your dopamine got me higher than thе ceiling
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up

[Verse 2]
Darkness around, you come and save me
All of my pieces brought to life
With every touch you got me hazy
Just wanna feel it one more time
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I did it all, and I did it all to get to you
'Cause there's nobody else that takes me up the way you do

[Chorus]
You're all I need, come and hit me with the feeling
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up
Your dopamine got me higher than the ceiling
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up
Don't let me go 'cause I want it every weekend
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up
Your dopamine got me higher than the ceiling
Heart sped up, h-h-heart sped up
