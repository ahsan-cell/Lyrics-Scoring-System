At times don't know to make things better
You can't fake a smile forever
Are you really doing alright?
Everything inside you wanted
You tried your best to come the longing
But there are certain things you can't deny
Pictures of before haunt you daily
What happens when the door opens?

[Chorus]
A pair of dancing shoes
Her only wish waiting on Christmas Eve
Now she is laying on her bed
She's smiling in her sleep
Watch her dancing in the night
There's no worries by her side
She just knows she wants to be a little dancer
Wishing for a dream

[Verse 2]
Perfect was within your reach
But your mind running, your heart couldn't keep up
Bear all of your passion inside
It's not too late to change the story
You could rearrange it only
If letting go of fears is what you decide
Can't help but they dream
Thoughts keep racing
You almost wanna scream
You're yearning for it!
You might also like[Chorus]
A pair of dancing shoes
Her only wish waiting on Christmas Eve
Now she is laying on her bed
She's smiling in her sleep
Watch her dancing in the night
There's no worries by her side
She just knows she wants to be a little dancer
Wishing for a dream

[Verse 3]
Wishing for a dream
Exactly where you are
No matter where you go
Remembering your heart
When you saw

[Outro]
A pair of dancing shoes
Her only wish waiting on Christmas Eve
Now she is laying on her bed
She's smiling in her sleep
Watch her dancing in the night
There's no worries by her side
She just knows she wants to be a little dancer
Wishing for a dream
Wishing for a dream
Wishing for a dream
Wishing for a dream
Wishing for a dream
