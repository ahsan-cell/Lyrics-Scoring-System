Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why'd you have to go away from home?
Me love (Hey)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why'd you have to go away from home?
Me love

[Verse 1]
See, the first time me looking at your eyes, me did tell you want a guy like me (Guy like me)
We use to have good times on the evening, me and you chilling on the beach (On the beach)
We use to kiss and caress, and trust me, girl, it feels so sweet (Feels so sweet)
Then one day you moved, now I'm feeling kind of blue 'cause we hear say you leave (You leave)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why'd you have to go away from home?
Me love
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Why'd you have to go away from home?
Me love

Now I'm sittin' in a chair with no one here and I'm feelin all alone (All alone)
Thinkin to myself like, damn, why my baby up and gone? (Up and gone)
It's like I'm missin' her and I know she's missin' me (Missin' me)
It's been two years and a half, and July will make it three (Make it three)

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like I'm drowning in the ocean
Somebody come and take me away

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
