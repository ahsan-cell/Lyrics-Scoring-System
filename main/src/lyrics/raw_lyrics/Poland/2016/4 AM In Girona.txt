[Verse 1]
Running from the fame
In a rented Beemer, 140 in the rain
I remember I was hoping for a change
Funny how I really don't want it, once it came
Paparazzi on a lookout
Come on, little baby, look proud
By the way though she hates being called a model
That ain't fair, cause she's only into books now
We fucked around and made a new sound (goddamn)
Fucked around, made the news howl, goddamn
Fucked around, made a few stacks, goddamn
I fucked around I got the blues now
I'm staying in Brussels and London now
And only my real people come around
The people that I'm leaving in the past
Keep calling to lend them a couple thou', huh

[Chorus]
I don't like that
I don't really like that
I remember messaging my idols
Hoping that they write back
But they never write back
Why they never write back?
(Why they never write back?)
I remember teasing my demons
Hoping that they bite back, argh!
I don't like that
I don't really like that
Now I got these kids in my DMs (DMs)
Begging me to write back (uh huh)
I don't write back (I don't write back)
Why I never write back? (why I never write back?)
I remember messaging my heroes (heroes)
Feeling like a psychopath

Now this is the season for fox huntin'
And they will not stop til they got somethin'
This relationship got their heart jumpin'
I'll say it now, make sure I'm not mumblin'
I'm in love with her
There you go, put it in your article
I just fell in love, doesn't mean that I'm a fool
They've been, uh, turning love into a carnival
They've been, uh, wondering if I'm honorable
Listen up though, here's the thing
I only care what my momma and my sister think
Fuck going online, that ain't part of my day
And they been lying non stop, so you'd click the link

[Chorus]
I don't like that (hey, hey)
I don't really like that (hey, hey)
I remember messaging my idols
Hoping that they write back
But they never write back
Why they never write back?
(Why they never write back?)
I remember teasing my demons
Hoping that they bite back, argh!
I don't like that
I don't really like that
Now I got these kids in my DMs (DMs)
Begging me to write back (uh huh)
I don't write back (I don't write back)
Why I never write back? (why I never write back?)
I remember messaging my heroes (heroes)
Feeling like a psychopath
[Outro: Cold War, dir. Paweł Pawlikowski]
“- Pan uciekł, pan nas zdradził, pan nas oczernił. Pan zostawił młodzież, młodych ludzi, którzy panu zaufali. Pan Polski nie kocha
- Kocham
- Nie kocha Pan.”14
