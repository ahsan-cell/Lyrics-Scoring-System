To create a Darien gap in the road to success
And think, might as well just sink and make a home in the mess
To convalesce, still low at me best, but I'm ill though (I'm ill)
Sad face emoji, ad space on holy ground
On the righteous path spinnin' sign posts around
On a panic-stricken manic mission
I've got an appetite for anarchism and high metabolism
Sick, skin tone pallor, stoned para
I say something underhanded with a smile like Mo Salah
Then switch the topic, misanthropic (ehh)
I prefer to kick the can off the road than down the middle of it
I'm an outlier, you're an out-and-out liar (liar)
We don't believe you when you say that shit sound's fire (not at all)
You're loosin' grip like a worn down tyre
I put a stop to the current flow like a ground wire (wire)

Yeah, yeah
Misanthropic, in a tight tee from hot topic
My prophet said collect the profit
30 Punjabis with me and you know we mobbin'
Opps sobbin', I'm a god, I'm a goblin
I rob Robin Hood in my hood, get philanthropic
Sippin' guave juice somewhere in the tropics
Smokin' exotic chronic with a gin and tonic
Ya bars myopic, you study Russ and Logic
You should peep my topics, check out my sonics
Sufi Islamic, spit a verse that's mad hypnotic
Used to mix the henny with hypnotic
Drank 'til I vomit, could have been a comic
Bombin' on narcotics, humor mad ironic
I'm philosophic, my psyche said I'm mad psychotic
You robotic, I heard you patriotic
I'm hyperbolic, shorty said I'm mad iconic
You might also likeAhh
I could make you slow down
Rearrange thoughts, make you lost
Start asking strangers for the time (time)
They built a clock now we watch it
Droppin' dimes outta pocket
Stuck to the bottom, got 'em
So much pressure in the streets
You can get the Benz
Watch out for your friends
You can get fucked and walk funny
You get rich play dummy
What's the price, nothing nice
Pick a plot, dig a ditch
Moses poured the concrete
The Metropolitans' fever pitch
They all watchin'
Lookin' square, livin' sloppy
Take a picture make a copy
'Til they belly up
Sticky traps for you dirty rats
Tricky raps off the rail
Maybe you bail, maybe you fail
I'm just tryin' to survive
Keep my baby alive
Kick a verse for the bit stream
With Lee and Heems
Baba ganoush
Yo, watch me get loose
Yo
Baba ganoush
Yo, watch me get loose
