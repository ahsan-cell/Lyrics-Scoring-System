Took a walk somewhere
Through the fog
To the roaring sea
I could almost see you there
Standin' right in front of me

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
And I know what it feels like
To be somebody, oh
Yeah, I know what it feels like (Eh, yeah)
To let somebody go
I know

[Verse 2: Jacob Collier]
Took a walk somewhere
Through the fire
To the roarin' sea
I thought I'd always need you there
Now, you're gone
You're just a memory, yeah

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
And I know what it feels like
To be somebody, oh-woah
Now, I know what it feels like (Eh, yeah)
To let somebody go
I know
I know

Bring me back to life
I feel that ocean of love
The waves come crashin' down
Love's a constellation
Let me take you to the sky
Inside my heart
When the shadows fall
And the world goes 'round
See the storm rise up
And it all falls down without you

[Verse 3: Jacob Collier]
Let me be angry
Let me be patient
Let me be happy
Let me be ordinary
Ordinary (Woo)

[Interlude: Jacob Collier, Jessie Reyez]

Time
I just gotta live my life
I don't wanna just get by
Why?
I don't wanna waste my time
That's no way to die
That's no way to
Die
