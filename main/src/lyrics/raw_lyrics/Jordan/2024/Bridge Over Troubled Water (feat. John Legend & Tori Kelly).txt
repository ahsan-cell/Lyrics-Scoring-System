When you're weary
Feeling small
And tears are in your eyes (Ooh, woah-oh)
I will dry them all (Ooh, ooh)
I am by your side (Ooh, ooh, oh)
When times get tough (Ooh)
And friends just can't be found

[Chorus: Yebba  & Jacob Collier]
Like a bridge over troubled water (Ooh, ooh, woah)
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water (Ooh, ooh, I will)
I will lay me down (Ah, ah)
(Lay me down)

[Verse 2: John Legend  & Jacob Collier]
When you're down and out (Ooh, ooh-ooh)
When you're on the street (Ooh)
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
I'll take your part (Ooh)
Yes, when darkness comes (Mmm, oh-oh-ooh)
And pain is all around

[Chorus: John Legend & Jacob Collier]
Like a bridge over troubled water (Ooh, over water)
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I will lay me down (I will lay me)

Oh, if you need a friend (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh)
I'm sailing right behind

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Jacob Collier]
Oh, like a bridge over troubled water (Troubled water)
I will lay me down, lay me, lay me
Lay me down, lay me down (Lay)
Lay me down (Oh, lay)
Lay me, lay me, lay me down
Lay me down (Oh)
Oh (Ah-ah-ah, lay)
Lay me down
