(Woo)
(Are you ready?)
Well!
Well!

[Verse 1]
Drowning, fishing, dropping, screaming under the lights
I'm feeling everything crashing, burning, I lost track of time
Into you

[Chorus]
I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I think I'm reading you well
I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I think I'm reading you well

[Verse 2]
Burning, crashing, trampoline, the edge of the sun
I think I fell in love with lightning bolt, I'm ready to run
Into you

[Chorus]
I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I think I'm reading you well
Believe it, believe it, I think I'm reading you well (Well, think I'm reading you well)
(I think I'm reading you well)

[Bridge]
Waiting, I'm patient
In keeping, I'm wanting more
Picking up the loose puzzle pieces
Scattered around the floor
Linking, I'm drifting
Just waiting for you to know
Following the crumbs that I left for you
Leading to my door
Waiting, I'm patient (Hey, oh)
In keeping, I'm wanting more (Hey)
Picking up the loose puzzle pieces
Scattered around the floor
Linking, I'm drifting (Hey, oh)
Just waiting for you to know (Hey)
Following the crumbs that I left for you
Leading to my door

I think I'm screaming, I, I think I'm reading you well
I'm breathing, I'm breathing, I think I'm reading you well
I think I'm reading you well
