Gon' take this raindrop
Down to the sea, oh
It will wash my
Fears away-ay-ay
And when I wake up
I'll see you smilin'
You are my ocean
Rain down on me

[Chorus: Choir]
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet (Ooh)
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet (Ooh)
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet (Ooh)
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet
Yeah
Get up on your feet

Never been the one for backin' down
I keep it steady, ready if somebody at me now
Well, life is funny, so sometimes, you gotta act a clown
But one thing about a blessin', it come back around
I ask around
I'm known by over half the town
And thеy rooting for a kid like me
I was once at homе all alone makin' songs
In the image of a person that I just might be
So now, I feel free, tell me what's next
Will it go right if I turn left?
If I'm only takin' flight, can we cop a little jet?
There's so much I wanna see and so much I'm gonna get
Gotta keep my stride with the rep, a pepped up step
I'ma be just fine, you can make that bet
Everything is on time 'cause it's all concept
Live a carefree life, ain't got one regret now (I feel so free)

[Chorus: Choir]
Ooh
Get up on your feet
Get up on your feet (Smoke one, yeah)

[Verse 2: D Smoke]
(Super!)
Woke up this morning with joy in my mouth (Yeah)
And love on my lips (Ayy)
Nothing's too much for a child of creation (No, no)
Was born with this gift (Uh-huh)
Si el dolor es pesado, no pares
The rain came from heaven to harvest
I promise you, love is the ocean
And I'm just a little droplet, aye
They said it couldn't be done
Mama was a queen and she raised three sons
Takin' deep breaths like I got three lungs
No es mi final, we are just begun (Ayy)
Be ready, now the pain stops
Collectin' the blessings and raindrops
Been livin' in a box of stars
Just the whole, wide world
With the love of my heart
Let's go
[Verse 3: Sho Madjozi]
Maybe the scrollin' is not good for my, good for my head
I'm scrollin', and scrollin', like, scrollin', and scrollin', and scrollin'
I'm scrollin' and scrollin' that phone 'til I wish I was dead, now
I said what I said
I should be cheerin' instead of upset
I should be cheesy and hop on that trend
Isn't it easier just to pretend?
What do I get (Hey)
Down to my elbows, down to my knees
Down to my one down chosen feed
Down to the purpose and down to the seeds
Down to the sun as it rise in the east
Down to the sky as karma's peace
Down to the smallest thing there is
Wash me raindrops, wash me clean
Maybe then, I might be me (Hello)

[Interlude: Yelle]
Allo, ouais, ça te dit de venir danser là?
Ouais, je ne sais pa, ça doit être, hmm
Des bijoux?
Un, deux, trois, quatre!

[Verse 4: Yelle]
Dansez comme cela vous chante
Chantez comme cela vous pense
Pensez comme cela vous tente
On s'en fout qu'ça ait du sense
On met un pied devant l'autre
On le met derrière aussi
On le met sur le côté
Et puis on fait la toupie
(Ah-ha!)
[Verse 5: Kanyi Mavi]
Kubo kubo iTolo litshona kubo
Aligobi alijiki phambili itsho inqubo
Bendiyombethe irwexa lengubo
De ndawanyathela onke lameva angumgubo
Ziyabonkala iziphumo zentshukumo
Ndinityebisela ngamagama angangomdlali wesumo
Life is good - Sdumo
Ndivuka ndinoncumo naphakathi kwendudumo
Ndiyakhululeka kulomboko ndiyeke
Thula wena ubheke ndikhe ndipheke
Ndibulela ungakhali oko ndiqhekeke ndhikele
INtsikelelo zigcwale zichiteke idolo ndibeke (Get up on your feet)
INtando yakho mayeneke, uThando maluqheleke
INkohlakalo isiyeke iMpilo yongezeke uMdali adeke, yeah

Get up on your feet
