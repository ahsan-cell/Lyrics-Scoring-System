I just want your body, babe
By my side, candle light inside
Take a hold of me
I said, "Oh-la-la-la-la"
You sweeten me open (A little)
And I can't get you off my mind now
I must've tried a hundred thousand times now
But somethin' 'bout that “oh-la-la-la-la”
Is keepin' me holdin’ on and I can't let go now

[Chorus: Jacob Collier, Lindsey Lomis]
Oh (La-la)
You give me a rush now, sugar
Say, oh (La-la)
You're my cinnamon crush now, sugar
Say, oh (La-la, la-la)
You're keepin' it hush now, sugar
Say, oh, sugar (La-la)

[Verse 2: Lindsey Lomis, Jacob Collier]
I just want you next to me, by my side
Won't you hold me close? No slippin' away
It's like, "Oh-la-la-la-la"
'Cause I want you more than a little (Ah)
I've waited for you all my life
I never thought that I could find your love
I think that I'm ready, take me on a sugar high

Oh (La-la)
You give me a rush now, sugar
Say, oh (La-la)
You're my cinnamon crush now, sugar
Say, oh (La-la)
We keepin' it hush now, sugar?
Say, oh (Hey, oh, no)
(Ooh)

[Bridge: Jacob Collier, Lindsey Lomis]
I don't know which way the wind may blow
I don't know if this will last for long
But I know this feeling’s real inside
I can't get you off my mind
Singing, oh
My mind
My mind, my mind
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Outro: Jacob Collier & Lindsey Lomis, Lindsey Lomis]
Somethin’ ’bout you laced with cinnamon
Sweet shop, won't you let me in again?
Just stay forever
Hush me up then make me glow again
Wake me up and kiss me slow again
Just stay forever
Somethin' 'bout you keeps me up at night
Touch me, tease me, bring me back to life
Just stay forever (You're my cinnamon crush, my sugar)
Take me to a place I've never been
Endless sweetness, lift me up again
Just stay forever (You're my cinnamon crush, my sugar)
