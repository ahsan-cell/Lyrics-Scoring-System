You tell me you love me
But you got me feelin' kinda lonely
I never thought that I'd see the day
You tell me you got me
Said you'd always be my one and only
I'm feelin' like you're driftin' away

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Collier]
I'm holdin' out for somethin'
I'm comin' up with nothin'
I'm losin' hope that ever we can start again
Been holdin' us together
Through many kinds of weather
Said you'd never hurt me, but I'm broken-hearted

[Chorus: Jacob & Lawrence]
Lovin' you, holdin' you
Feelin' that this time I'm lettin' you go
End of the road, but I
Know you'll be with me wherever I go

[Verse 2: Gracie Lawrence]
You tell me you love mе
And I know we said forever
But tomorrow's feelin' so far away
I know that you want mе
But we both know it's over
With a little bit of time, it'll all be okay, oh no

There's so much information
I'm tired of education
It's time for reformation, we can start again
Been holdin' us together
Through many kinds of weather
Said you'd never hurt me, now I'm broken-hearted

[Chorus: Jacob & Lawrence, Michael McDonald]
Lovin' you (Lovin' you), holdin' you (Oh, baby)
Feelin' that this time I'm lettin' you go
End of the (Lovin' you) road, but I (Oh)
Know you'll be with me wherever I go

[Bridge: Michael McDonald, Jacob & Lawrence]
I know, but it hurts so bad
Hurts so bad, hurts so bad
I know, but it hurts so bad
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad like

[Outro: Jacob & Lawrence, Jacob Collier, Clyde Lawrence, Gracie Lawrence]
Ah, oh yeah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, oh yeah
'Cause you're with me, you're with me, you're with me
Wherever I go
