Ay yo, I'm pretty cool, yo, everybody love me
Hindu thuggy, from Queens where my thugs be
In a Polo rugby, I Tokyo drift my buggy
I been an OG since mama copped me Huggies
Shorties wanna hug me, I'll never say who the plug be
I seen you on the internet doin' the Dougie
My shira's name Happy
Bunty, lovey, I'm chubby
Bloody hell, my buddies all go dummy
I'm mad funny, people laughing my jokes
And I dress real well, yo, I cool on some boats
I wear a leather jacket, people ask me 'bout my coat
Thеy like I listen to heems, his songs are so dopе
I smell real good, I spray Dior on my throat
I work remote while watching Murder She Wrote
I lived in a castle, it float past the mo-o
Oh, you the goat? Tonight I'm eating curry goat
Oh, you the goat? I'm eating goat biryani for dinner
Yo, I'm a winner, I'm more vain now that I'm thinner
My dough nuts, ich bin ein Berliner
I'm in a Sprinter, you just a beginner
Gwap, stretch like yoga, I flow like Vinyasa
I'm at the crib watching Piazza with the Rasta
I'm eating pasta, a little kielbasa
With a Dominican girl named Yo Casta
I dive like scuba, she glow like tuba
I'm lookin' like I'm drivin' Uber
I'm blowin' Buddha with barracudas in a Ruba
My ooda from Cuba, my money like Scooter
But yo, I'm cuter, I'm a commuter
I'm out in Chattanooga, doin' a puja, a suda
I get brain like computer
Peep how I maneuver, the cuda and the hooda
You might also likeI was coppin' port-a-waters and bologna sandwiches
You wasn't born yet when I saw those buildings vanish, kid
I'm from around the world, I'm not sure what my accent is
I'm on a hammock, they can't fathom what my bandwidth is
Passionate activist who passionless on activists
Pacifist advocate who pass a fist that's adequate
I've been a savage since they used to call us savages
I roll with arrows, bumpin' horse and carriage standin' shit
They see me, they'll get shook and look just like a mannequin
I'm where the mammoth is, I'm bright, I'm light like halogen
I'm like I'm right, I fight all night, ayo, I like gigantic spliff
Hammerin' tamarin', I'm handling these gatherings
I rap like it's a mandolin to cope with they shenanigans
Ramo and Flanagan, I'm New York like I'm Madison
I'm New York like Canal Street where Africans talk Mandarin
New York with that pitter-patter, battered in the clattering
New York with that pitter-patter, battered in the clattering
New York with that pitter-patter, battered in the clattering
New York
