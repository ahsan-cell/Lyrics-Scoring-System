Two heartbeats on the floor, candle lighting
Angels at my door, no silver lining
I don't masquerade inside the flame
But I miss you like summer rain
Shadows on the wall (On the wall), border-lining
I thought they'd never fall, worlds colliding
I don’t catch a wave, my summer rain
I can't breathe without you
I won't walk away, I feel the pain
But I can't bleed without you

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
I get by without you
I get high
But I miss you like summer rain

[Verse 2: Madison Cunningham]
Kiss me to my core, paralyzing
Hold me where I'm sore, never minding
I don't know your name or feel your shame
But I miss you like summer rain
Don't love you anymore, I'm providing
You hеld me down before, nеver asking
Why I'm so afraid to walk your way
I'm so free without you
I won't catch the rain, won’t feel the same
I'm alive without you

I get by without you
I’m so high
But I miss you like summer rain

[Bridge: Jacob Collier]
And every night, I feel so tired
But I can't sleep
Without you near, I close my eyes
I wish you were here

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
But I get by
I get by
So high
But I miss you like summer rain

[Outro: Jacob Collier, Madison Cunningham]
Miss you like summer rain
Miss you like summer rain
Miss you like summer rain
Miss you like summer rain
