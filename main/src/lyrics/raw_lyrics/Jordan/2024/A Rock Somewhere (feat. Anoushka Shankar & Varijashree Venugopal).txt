I'm on a rock somewhere
It's the only one I know, and I know it well
And somehow, I know you're there
And I'm waitin' on the world
I'm ringing the old church bell
I've forgotten how it goes, but it feels like Hell
I guess you're in Heaven now
And you're never comin' home

[Chorus]
'Cause even when I'm wide awake, I know
That you’ve been havin’ other dreams for sure
If nothing's ever gonna change at all
I'll be waitin' on the world
Go

[Verse 2]
Conditional words, I swear
See thе people come and go, and thеy go so well
They're countin' the coins back there
It's the only thing they know

[Chorus]
And even when you're down and out, I know
That you've been up in higher ground for sure
If nothing's ever gonna change at all
I'll be waitin' on the world
Only waitin' on the world
Go

I'm on a rock somewhere
And I've been lookin' at my phone, baby, I'm not scared
I guess I’m alone, my friend
You left me waitin' on the world
I'll be waitin' on the world
