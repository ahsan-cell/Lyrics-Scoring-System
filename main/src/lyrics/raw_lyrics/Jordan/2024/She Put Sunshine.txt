She put sunshine into my silhouette
Was feeling heavy and she got me drunk instead
Corner to corner, line by line
She's making me dream out loud
She put sunshine into my open mouth
Too many words gave me something to sing about
Morning to morning, rhyme by rhyme
She's giving me back my smile
She's keeping me warm all the while

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows just how to wake me
She paints me gold and shakes me

[Chorus]
I get a little lonely
And she comes to me, she illuminates me
And if she ever gets close to me
Well, it's plain to see
She'd incinerate me
But I don't mind her giving me her sunshine smile
(Woah!)

[Verse 2]
She put sunshine onto my internet
Connection was low, she put a ring on it
Colder and colder, crime to crime
She's opening up windows
To everything I don't know

She knows just how to fake me
She paints me bold and stakes me

[Chorus]
I get a little lonely
And she comes to me, she illuminates me
And if she ever gets close to me
Well, it's plain to see
She'd incinerate me
But I don't mind her giving me her sunshine smile
(Woah!)

[Chorus]
But I get a little lonely
And she comes to me, she illuminates me
And if she ever gets close to me
Well, it's plain to see
She'd incinerate me
But I get a little lonely
And she comes to me, she illuminates me
And if she ever gets close to me
Well, it's plain to see
She'd incinerate me
But I can't help her giving me her sunshine smile
