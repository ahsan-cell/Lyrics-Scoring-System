I said I hit the L-I-E in my old ass Lexus
Reckless swervin' 'cross the seventeenth exit
Connector Squad, Hollywood heems the nexus
Yo, that's a yellow chakra in my solar plexus
One from mama, one from nani, two necklace
At the gurdwara, Waheguru, please protect us
They play my tunes in several rooms like two Alexas
Yo, I'm a legend out in Sugarland, Texas
Shawty talk her shit, said I act too pretentious
Said I'm bacon egg and cheese for my breakfast
I tell my peoplе how the census affects us
Lifе is precious, the government neglect us
He be the best, yo, I heard that's consensus
Said I'm known across the world for my directness
Used to drink 'til excess, 'til I remembered I'm the bestest
I'm like a city during COVID, said my bars infectious

Yeah, uh, six
Oh, it's that easy
Hemi waddup

Look, I was recording at the door set, I'm pouring up a portion
I shot him in his leg so I wouldn't get the Porsche wet
A little blood on the floor'll void the warranty
I done made like a hundred and three this week, off a V, that's Verizon
Stash in the trunk of the corner was surprising
I got rich and we ain't seen 'em since (we ain't seen 'em since)
Not a team lit, orderin' jeans out of Neiman's
I'm standin' at the pot, whippin' remix
I ain't had no rich parents or brother in the industry (no)
My mama and shorty the only ones that was helpin' me (yup)
Them ones and some iceberg had me feelin' like a Jesus (that's right)
This .40 cal got some bark on it, but it's not a treat (woof)
Before you walk up to my car, think about your seed
You wanna see 'em growin', drop 'em off at soccer practice
Take my advice and keep walkin' 'cause a lot can happen
I'm just sayin'
You might also likeTalkin' trash, it's pez dispensin'
My head intact, but fez is missin'
Don't get it twisted, leg submissions
My personal hell is air conditioned
My durag is front facin'
Like cute glass in slum basements
Huge ass dumb-dumb casings
I'm Ted Long with holla hollas
Headstrong in balaclavas
From a long line of collar poppers
I wish I'd met my father's father
Damn it, Jim, I'm not a doctor
It hurts when I bend it
I either need a church or a clinic
The worst cash register independent
No nosebleeds from indecision
No need, I've been committed
Smoked trees during intermission
I'm track three from "It Was Written"
