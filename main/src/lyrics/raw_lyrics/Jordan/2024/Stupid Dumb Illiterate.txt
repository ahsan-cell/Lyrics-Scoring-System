Stupid dumb illiterate
They're poppin' on the way to the function (yeah)
I'm a child of immigrants (mama)
Yo, I speak the mother tongue, but I'm illiterate (mama)
I'm an idiot, but only just a little bit (mama)
I'm inconsiderate, smokin' on a cigarette (mama)
I'm belligerent with a golden soul
I'm not Janet Jackson, I got no control
I'm bold and beautiful, I'm getting old
Punjabi Oscar Isaac, I'm so cold
Hemi been in the game for a minute
And got more spirit than Glenlivet or Glenfiddich
I see no limits, white people hear me and say that's thе ticket
I'm lost and found, I'm lost, I'm brown
I paid the cost to be thе boss in town
I turned my frown upside down
Along the way I made some sounds (Outbound)

They're poppin' on the way to the function
Stupid dumb illiterate

There was a man with a golden soul
All that he found didn't make him whole
Crashes and failures of lust and frown along the way
Along the way
There was a man with a golden soul
All that he found didn't make him whole
Crashes and phases of love still found along the way
Along the way
