Little blue, be my shelter
Be my cradle, be my womb
Be my boat, be my river
Be the stillness of the moon
If I could, I'd go with you
To a place I never knew
In your eyes, so dark and open
There’s a light that leads me back to you

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Collier]
'Cause you're not so far away
I hear you say
"You’ll never walk alone"
Singin'

[Chorus: Jacob Collier]
Don't be afraid of the dark
In your heart
You're gonna find a way
To carry the weight of the world
On your shoulders
You're gonna find a way home

[Verse 2: Brandi Carlile, Jacob Collier]
Little blue, be my anchor
Be my light, my compass star
Be my darkness, be my danger
Be the strings of my guitar
Little blue (Little blue), how I love you (How I love you)
Somethin' strong and somethin' true
In your arms (In your arms), so dear and gentle
There's a home that leads me back to you

[Chorus: Jacob Collier & Brandi Carlile]
Don't be afraid of the dark, in your heart
You're gonna find a way
To carry the weight of the world on your shoulders
You're gonna find a way
Don’t be afraid of the light, it's alright
You're gonna find your way
To carry the weight of the world on your shoulders
You're gonna find your way home
