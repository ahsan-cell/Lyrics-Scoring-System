[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]

[Verse 2: Heems]
Yo, I be eatin', I'm the Pac-Man, me, I move the Pack man
Roll around with Pack mans, my man got the strap, man
He pack a knack in the back, man, I've been that, man
Don't know how to act, man, yo, that's a fact, man
Me, I just rap, man, I'm like Hugh Jackman
I'm a Hugh Jackman, damn, that shit slack, man
Jugi give me that, man, this verse is a rap, man
No cap, Queen's back on the map

[Verse 3: Your Old Droog]

[Verse 4: Heems]
Afghanistan, that's how I tally bands
I blam your fam, a week ago, hand to hand
I'll shoot the dove, we could go man to man
A handsome man in the jungle with the rangatans
Y'all know Hemi, jazz and sashimi
Shorties call me dreamy and steamy when they see me
I eat linguine and my man Lamborghini
Make the money Houdini and some drip like a genie
Yo, I was dusted, reading map textbooks
Yo, my right hook better than my left hook
Yo, they ain't white hoods, they can't see my checkbook
I'm in Red Hook, cookin' fish, I'm the head cook
You don't wanna take bonga, let's eat tunda
I'm comfy in the tundra or in the rotunda
I'm summer humid, listenin' to Sun Ra
Yo, I bring the dunda, I make your ass nungaYou might also like
