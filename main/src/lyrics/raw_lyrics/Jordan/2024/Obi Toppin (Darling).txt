Hot Jacket
Hot Jacket like a jacket
Stimulated thoughts with that National Basketball Association crossover
Always boss over, for an easy two
My paragraphs dip and move
I'm up there, my hand can stretch and touch the moon
Bust a hard right on Lexington
My shopper gives her messages
My vocals, I pass 'em off to messengers
The American dream like heems
Words slide on the Bruckner breeze off the Queens
Women can't wait in they tight jeans
Most rappers, I pull 'em up like shirt sleeves
That's just me, T .O .P
I'm Obi with the toppin
Burnin' rap likе a turkey sausage
Who cares and who do and don't pay homagе
Ah, on the floor, that's them, that's that vomit
Yeah, on the floor, most rappers are on the floor

Darling, whatever happened
Floor
Darling
Look happy

Ayo, your bars elementary like Abbott
Me, I'm a Rukawa, 11-11 jacket
You can't see me, I'm in the next tax bracket
I'll break your nose with your pickleball racket
She topping me, Obi, make her come quickly
Gave her a rose and she gave me a hickey
She stay on point like her last name Brunson
Gave her my heart at the Emirates in London
Post up in the crib and you know we play the Sims
I copped her orange Julius, we watch above the rims
Traveled a thousand miles, we sittin' on the queue
We shop at Kiehl's, she said she never heard of you
I'm in my Knicks bag and skid like Mary Poppins
My plate full with the seasoning and toppings
I'm sellin' drugs to the parents on the school street
Yo, check me out, I got a song with Kool Keith

Darling
Whatever happened, darling
Whatever happened, I take the blame
Oh, I'm not ashamed, girl
