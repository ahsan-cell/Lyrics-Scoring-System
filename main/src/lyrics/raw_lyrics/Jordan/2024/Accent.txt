Proximity to, but alive enough to bear witness
The grief is in the fact that we have survived
So how can our survival honor this?

Manshoo
When the premises betray promises, who do you run to?
Your feet are tired of running from hate and they put a gun to your head
And so you pray for peace, become a piece of prey
Cried out, how do you muster tears for today?
Do I aspire to a hashtag of my memory?
They're taking my humanity, it's draining of my energy
How many likes will my hate crime receive?
How many times will the hate crimes deceive?
It's easier to make a meme than to have a dream
'Cause to Heems it just seems that they deem as a scheme
Can you flee when they treat you like dogs with the fleas?
You say please, but they beat you like dogs with disease
And the plans dried up and you're out of tears
And your visa ran out so you're out of years
And how does my accent sound when I'm crying?
How does my accent sound when I'm dying?
When I'm dying, when I'm dying
How does my accent sound when I'm crying?
How does my accent sound when I'm dying?
When I'm dying, when I'm dying
How does my accent sound?
How does my accent sound?You might also like
