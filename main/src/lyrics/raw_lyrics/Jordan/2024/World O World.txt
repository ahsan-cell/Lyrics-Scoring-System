You've been my home
Home
Home
Now, it's time for me to go
Give me the wings to fly (To fly, oh)
Sun did rise and sun did fall
You've been with me through it all
Always keeping by my side
Always by my side

Love, o love
You've been a friend
Love, oh
Love, oh
Now, the road must reach an end
Come, it is time to go (It's time, oh)
Time is swift to come to pass
Nothing stays and nothing lasts
Always moving on (Moving on and on)
Always moving on

And when I call your name
I think I love again
I lay my world upon your hands
Your hands, again
And when you hold my pain
I feel my fire again, ooh
You are my soul
Oh, take me home
