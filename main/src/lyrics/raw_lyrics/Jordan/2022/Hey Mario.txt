I know you think you love her, but dude it's such a bummer
How you chase that girl around
You've been fighting all her battles, if she's really worth the hassle
You'd be living in the castle by now
And it makes me sick how you break these bricks
For a girl who barely knows you exist
Now you're tripping on mushrooms just for fun, dude...
I think you've got a problem

[Chorus]
Mario get your [coin] together bro
You've got to know this princess isn't worth these extra lives
Just let her go (go go) Mario, you're a next level bro
And she's a jump too short when the clock is running low

Hey Mario! Get your [coin] together
Hey Mario! Or you'll chase this [coin] forever

[Verse 2]
Warp zone, friend zone, high score
No more stalking this chick in a Koopa-Troopa town
Live life easy like Luigi, ain't never let a Ho get him down!
Let Koopa keep her bro, grab a flower and go
We'll jump the flag pole and light up the night
Hit rainbow road with Toad, we spinning them tires...
And spitting hot fire
You might also like[Chorus]
Mario get your [coin] together bro
You've got to know this princess isn't worth these extra lives
Just let her go (go go) Mario, you're a next level bro
But the Peach been cheating and you know I ain't talking code

[Bridge]
You're a plumber, a doctor, a race car driver
An athlete, a spaceman, a "Super Smash" survivor
You've got coins like mad, get a bachelor pad, down in coco beach
Where the hunnies at
Yeah! Get up, get up, get off the floor
She's not the one worth dying for

[Chorus]
Mario get your [coin] together bro
You've got to know this princess isn't worth these extra lives
Just let her go (go go) Mario, you're a next level bro
And she's a jump too short when the clock is running low

Mario get your [coin] together bro
You've got to know this princess isn't worth these extra lives
Just let her go (go go) Mario, you're a next level bro
But the Peach been cheating and you know I ain't talking code

Hey Mario! Get your [coin] together
Hey Mario! Or you'll chase this [coin] forever
