The king and his men stole the queen from her bed
And bound her in her bones
The seas be ours beyond the powers
Where we will, we'll roam

[Chorus]
Yo, ho, all hands
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die
Yo, ho, haul together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die
Yo, ho, haul together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we dieYou might also like
