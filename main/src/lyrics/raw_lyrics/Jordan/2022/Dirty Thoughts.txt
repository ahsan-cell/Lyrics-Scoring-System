I get dirty thoughts about you
They get worse when I'm without you
Does that mean that I'm going to hell?
Or are you thinking them as well?

[Verse 1]
When I'm lonely
All the corners of my mind start racing
Things that should be kept in the basement
Spend my time trying to erase them (Erase them)
But when you hold me
In the fantasy, it's so convincing
I shouldn't think the things I'm thinking
But now I've gone and let them sink in

[Pre-Chorus]
The more that I push 'em away
The more that you're stuck in my brain
The more I mentally undress, I confess

[Chorus]
I get dirty thoughts about you
They get worse when I'm without you
Does that mean that I'm going to hell?
Or are you thinking them as well?
I get dirty thoughts about you
They're so strong that I'm about to
Say them all to you out loud
God can't save me now
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'm frustrated
Do you really look good naked?
And I know that it ain't that holy
But Lord, I need this one night only

[Pre-Chorus]
The more that I push 'em away
The more that you're stuck in my brain
The more I mentally undress, I confess

[Chorus]
I get dirty thoughts about you
They get worse when I'm without you
Does that mean that I'm going to hell?
Or are you thinking them as well?

[Outro]
I get dirty thoughts (I get dirty)
I get dirty thoughts (Th-th-th-thoughts)
I get dirty thoughts (I get dirty)
I get dirty thoughts about you
I get dirty thoughts (I get dirty)
I get dirty thoughts (Th-th-th-thoughts)
I get dirty thoughts (I get dirty)
I get dirty thoughts about you2
