I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed

[Verse 1]
In my mind
Late at night
Overthinking everything in my life
Just wondering if I'm doing anything right
All these demons inside start to really come alive
Oh my
I get anxious and I don't know why
I can hear my dreams calling me
But all these doubts are haunting me
Oh, why's it always right before I fall asleep that

[Chorus]
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
You might also like[Verse 2]
I get over, well, well, well
Would you look at that?
Another person telling me that I should just relax
"Calm down and take it easy everything will be okay"
Yeah, sure 'cause that's what they all say
But oh, my mind
Isn't really my friend sometimes
I can hear my dreams calling me
But all these doubts are haunting me
Oh, why's it always right before I fall asleep that

[Chorus]
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed so easily
My anxiety
Creeps inside of me
Makes it hard to breathe
What's come over me?
Feels like I'm somebody else
I get overwhelmed4
