SYNOPSIS: I finally got Ed Sheeran's Multiply and absolutely fell in love with it, so of course I had to get Plus as an early birthday present. "You Need Me, I Don't Need You" describes a situation similar to one I'm in now, so I'm naturally drawn to it. I just recently remembered how great of a song "Amnesia" is after hearing it on the radio and remembered how amazing it was live. "Give 'Em Hell, Kid" is one of my favorite songs on Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge and whenever I listen to it I practically scream the chorus, and actually emailed the lyrics to @sosad, with no regrets. "Dark Side" is going to be R5's new single and I've absolutely adored it since I first heard it.
