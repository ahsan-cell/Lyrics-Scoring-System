Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo

[Verse 1]
Debbie just hit the wall, she never had it all
One Prozac a day, husband's a CPA
Her dreams went out the door when she turned twenty-four
Only been with one man, what happened to her plan?

[Pre-Chorus]
She was gonna be an actress, she was gonna be a star
She was gonna shake her ass on the hood of Whitesnake's car
Her yellow SUV is now the enemy
Looks at her average life, and nothing has been alright

[Chorus]
Since Bruce Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)

[Post-Chorus]
(1985) (Woo-hoo-hoo)

[Verse 2]
She's seen all the classics, she knows every line
Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, even Saint Elmo's Fire
She rocked out to Wham!, not a big Limp Bizkit fan
Thought she'd get a hand on a member of Duran Duran

Where's the mini-skirt made of snake skin?
And who's the other guy that's singing in Van Halen?
When did reality become TV?
Whatever happened to sitcoms, game shows?
On the radio was

[Chorus]
Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied with 19, 19, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
She hates time, make it stop
When did Mötley Crüe become classic rock? (Classic rock)
And when did Ozzy become an actor?
Please make this stop, stop, STOP!

[Chorus]
And bring back Springsteen, Madonna, way before Nirvana
There was U2 and Blondie, and music still on MTV
Her two kids in high school, they tell her that she's uncool
'Cause she's still preoccupied, 1985 (Woo-hoo-hoo)
Since Bruce Springsteen (She hates time), Madonna, way before Nirvana (1985)
There was U2 (Make it stop) and Blondie, and music still on MTV (1985) (Woo-hoo-hoo)
Her two kids (She hates time) in high school, they tell her that she's uncool (1985)
'Cause she's still (Make it stop) preoccupied with 19, 19, 198523
