They all laughed as he turned around slow
They said, "You ain't welcome ’round here anymore
You just might as well go"
He wiped the blood from his face
As he slowly came to his knees
He said, "I'll be back when you least expect it
And Hell's coming with me
Hell’s coming with me"

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
There is a hill at the bottom of the valley
Where all the poor souls go when they die
And if you listen real close, you can hear 'em like a ghost
Sayin', "You're never gonna make it out alive"

[Verse 3]
There is a town at the bottom of that hill
They got a secret that they keep like a slave
They got a black magic preacher
And you'd do well to let him teach ya
You'll be headin' up that hill to the grave

[Chorus]
And it is well with my soul
You line your pockets full of money
That you steal from the poor
And on your way down the hill
You'll hear me ring that bell
I’d pay the devil twice as much to keep your soul
You might also like[Verse 4]
There was a drifter passin’ through that little valley
See, he had promised he was comin' back to town (Comin’ back to town)
They didn't know him by his face (Hmm)
Or by the gun around his waist (Hm-hm)
But he'd come back to burn that town to the ground

[Verse 5]
First, there was fire, then there was smoke
Then that preacher man was hangin' by a rope
And then they all fell to their knees
And begged that drifter, begged him, "Please"
As he raised his fist before he spoke

[Verse 6]
I am the righteous hand of God
And I am the devil that you forgot
And I told you one day you will see
That I’ll be back, I guarantee
And that hell's comin', hell's comin'
Hell, hell's comin' with me

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
And it is well with my soul
You line your pockets full of money
That you steal from the poor
And on your way down to hell
You'll hear me ring that bell
And I said, "Hell's comin' with me" (Hell's comin' with me)8
