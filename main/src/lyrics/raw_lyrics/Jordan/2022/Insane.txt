Y-Y-You-ouâ€”
Dearly beloved, for your entertainment
It's my pleasure to introduce to you Hell's latest arrival
The equal opportunity killer, Alastor

[Verse 1]
Hello, it's nice to meet you! (Hello!)
Now, can you tell me where I am?
I don't know how I got here, but I
I think I'm startin' to understand
I don't belong among the angels
And baby, that's just fine with me (Ha!)
The things I did up there were high school
But now I'm going for my degree

[Chorus]
Hey! Sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise, honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire

[Drop]
Ra-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da

Wait a minute, do I know you?
Weren't you an old pal of mine?
Departed from us far too early
But now we're meeting a second time
We used to have such fun together
And maybe you have what I need
But first, I have one tiny question
Tell me, do you demons bleed?

[Chorus]
Hey! Sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise, honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?
Haven't been the same since I expired
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire

[Drop]
Ra-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Ha-ha-ha, yeah!)
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da (Alright!)
Da-da, da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da
[Chorus]
Hey! Sorry, but you just got in my way (Ra-da, da-da-da-da)
I promise, honey, I can feel your pain (Da-da, da-da-da)
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit (Da-da, da-da-da-da)
Does that make me insane? (Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da)
Haven't been the same since I expired (Da-da, da-da-da-da)
Doesn't mean that I plan to retire (Da-da, da-da-da)
And now I have the power to bathe all of you in entertaining fire (Da-da, da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da, hahahaha!)

[Outro]
Hey! Sorry, but you just got in my way
I promise, honey, I can feel your pain
And maybe I enjoy it just a little bit
Does that make me insane?7
