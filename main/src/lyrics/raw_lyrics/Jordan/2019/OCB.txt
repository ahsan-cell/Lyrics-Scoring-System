Tryna find love in an OCB
I just hope my thoughts they don’t raid my high
Raid my
My friends they got Ph.D.’s
Suit and tie to match their degrees
Just to keep a job that they don’t like
Some live miles away but they never feel alone
It’s just us who chose to live in the city
And when the grass seems greener on the other side of home
It ain’t hard for us to see it clearly

You will never ever ever ever be alone
You will never ever ever ever be alone
You will never ever ever ever be alone
You will never ever ever ever be alone
Cause I’ll be there for you

Messy room I ain’t OCD
You be you and let me be me
I don’t need no one to dictate my life
My friends say I’m ADD
Cause they don’t see from my POV
That don’t mean I’m wrong and they be right
Some days we barely speak but they never feel alone
It’s just us who chose to live in the city
And when the grass seems greener on the other side of home
It ain’t hard for us to see it clearly
