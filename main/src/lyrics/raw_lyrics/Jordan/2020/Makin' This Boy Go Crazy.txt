Never seen a tan look so good, sunshine's treating you like it should
You gotta know the kinda glow you're giving off, baby that's dangerous
The way your hair blows in the wind, takes me to heaven and back again
The windows down, we're ridin' round, I bet you don't know what I'm thinking

[Chorus]
Oh girl you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me outta control with every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm saying
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy, crazy, crazy... yeah

[Verse 2]
Ain't no guessing 'bout where you're from, when that southern draw slips off your tongue
Your little town is coming out and every time it turns me on baby
I can catch a buzz without a drink, that's what your body does to me
Every kiss is like a sip, I wanna taste, over and over

[Chorus]
Oh girl you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me outta control with every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm saying
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy, crazy, crazy... yeah
Whoa whoa
Oh girl you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me outta control with every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm saying
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy, crazy, crazy...
I'm like whoah
Girl you make me feel like whoa
Spinning me outta control with every little move you're makin'
Driving me wild if you know what I'm saying
Hey, shoot another smile my way
You're makin' this boy go crazy, crazy, crazy...
You're making me
You're making me
Making me
