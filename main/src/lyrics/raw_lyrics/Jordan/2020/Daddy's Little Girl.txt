The smell of Old Spice
A flat cap on the dash
Windows rolled down in the wind
White lines flying past
Singing along with the radio
A little outta tune
Hanging onto that steering wheel
Was the man who hung the moon

[Chorus]
Used to wrap my hands around his little finger
Turns out he was wrapped around mine
He said "You can be anything you want to in this great big world"
But I'm always gonna be daddy's little girl

[Verse 2]
He always used to tell me "Don't grow up too fast
Love will come, love will go, your first won't be your last"
I didn't always listen when he gave me advice
Though I hate to admit it, but that man was always right

[Chorus]
Used to wrap my hands around his little finger
Turns out he was wrapped around mine
He said "You can be anything you want to in this great big world"
But I'm always gonna be daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl
You might also like[Verse 3]
When I count my blessings, I know where to start
He might not hold my hand no more
But he’ll always, always hold my heart

[Chorus]
Used to wrap my hands around his little finger
Turns out he was wrapped around mine
He said "You can be anything you want to in this great big world"
But I'm always gonna be
Yes I’m always gonna be daddy's little girl, daddy's little girl1
