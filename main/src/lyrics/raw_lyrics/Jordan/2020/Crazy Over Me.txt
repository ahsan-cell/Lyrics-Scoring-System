She said, "Honey, do you think I'm smart?"
I said, "Of course you are, ain't you lyin' here in my arms?"
She smiled, "Well, does this shirt make me look fat?"
I kinda leaned back and laughed
And I said, "Honey, what kind of question is that?"

[Chorus]
You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world
That could ever make me
Feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me

[Verse 2]
You can fuss about your hair
Say you ain't got no clothes to wear
But when you finally make up your mind
You go and change one more time
We can go out on Friday nights
A pretty girl could walk on by
If you really think I'd check her out
Come on, now

You're crazy
There ain't a girl in this whole wide world
That could ever make me
Feel the way I do about you, baby
Yeah, you're crazy
But you can be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me

[Bridge]
And all my stubborn ways
Puttin' up with the messes I make
I even ruined our first date
Well, girl, for goodness sakes

[Chorus]
You gotta be crazy
To ever let a boy like me call you "baby"
I thank God every day that you're my lady
Now that's a little crazy
So go on and be as crazy as you wanna be
As long as you're crazy over me

[Outro]
Crazy over me
