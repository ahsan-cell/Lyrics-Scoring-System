She looks so pretty with no makeup on (With no makeup on, with no makeup on)
You should hear her talkin' to her mama on the phone (To her mama on the phone, to her mama on the phone)
I love it when she raps to an Eminem song (Eminem song, Eminem song)
That's my girl
Man, her eyes really drive me crazy
You should see her smile when she holds a baby
I can honestly say that she saved me
My girl, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancin' around, causin' a scene
That's my girl, sipping Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl

[Verse 2]
Every night when she goes to bed
She hits her knees and bows her head
Thanks the Lord for another day
I just thank Him for my girl, yeah

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancin' around, causin' a scene
That's my girl, sippin' Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl

Yeah, that's my girl
In my truck, in the songs that I sing with the radio up
My girl
In my heart, in my soul and the air that I breathe every day
That's my girl
Yeah, everything
My girl

[Chorus]
That's my girl in the passenger seat
Windows down, dancin' around, causin' a scene
That's my girl, sippin' Crown and Sprite
In a ball cap, turned back, ooh, she got me like
Yeah, baby girl, you gone and done it again
Makin' all the guys wishin’ you were with them
But I bet they don't see what I see when I see my girl
Oh, my girl
Yeah, that's my girl2
