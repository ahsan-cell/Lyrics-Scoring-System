Baby got a ball cap on
She sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of those hazel eyes
Looking so good when she don't try

[Verse 1]
It's just an old worn out hat
I always wore it turned back
Man, I couldn't help but laugh
When she took it away from me

[Verse 2]
She don't know a thing about the Braves
She could care less about the game
But if you saw her right now you'd think
It never belonged to me

[Chorus]
Baby got a ball cap on
She sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of those hazel eyes
Looking so good when she don't try
Acting like it's no big deal
Smiling underneath that bill
Looking so right it's wrong
Baby got a ball cap on

It's seen a lot of crazy nights
Got a ballpark tear down the side
Yeah, I wore it all the time
But it's never been worn like that

[Chorus]
Baby got a ball cap on
She sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of those hazel eyes
Looking so good when she don't try
Acting like it's no big deal
Smiling underneath that bill
Looking so right it's wrong
Baby got a ball cap on
Yeah, got a ball cap on

[Bridge]
Gotta love her when she's in a dress
Always looking her best
But I tell you what
I can't resist

[Chorus]
When baby's got a ball cap on
She sure knows how to pull it off
Sun out of those hazel eyes
Looking so good when she don't try
Acting like it's no big deal
Smiling underneath that bill
Looking so right it's wrong
Baby got a ball cap on
Yeah, got a ball cap on
She got a ball cap, a ball cap
A ball cap, a ball cap on1
