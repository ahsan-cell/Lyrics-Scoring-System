I can see every time I look into your eyes
You don't care a thing about those other guys
Without words, you made me understand what's on your mind
The rhythm of your body next to mine

[Chorus]
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight

[Refrain]
Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot
Love's either right or it's wrong
Feels so good, love you a lot
Right here beside me is where you belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel
Until the dream of holding you is real

[Chorus]
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight

Sometimes it's cold, sometimes it's hot
Love's either right or it's wrong
Feels so good, love you a lot
Right here beside me is where you belong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't care if everybody knows the way I feel
Until the dream of holding you is real

[Chorus]
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
Oh-oh, I can tell by the way you dance
That you're gonna love me tonight
