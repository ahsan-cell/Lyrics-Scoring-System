Whippin' in the front two niggas boomin' in the back
Tell 'em I'm with all the smoke lil' nigga do you want a match
Why you braggin' 'bout that bitch I put that thooter on the map
Tell her I just want the brain, bitch your medulla on my lap

[Chorus]
It's a mark on my back so this jock on my waistline
I cannot fall for these sluts I can't waste time (and I fall for 'em)
(?) Pop out that with that tray five (57)
I up my shit then bro up at the same time
When I be whippin' in the front two niggas boomin' in the back
Tell 'em I'm with all the smoke lil' nigga do you want a match (tell 'em I'm with all the smoke)
Why you braggin' 'bout that bitch I put that thooter on the map
Tell her I just want the brain, bitch your medulla on my lap

[Verse]
Aye mop out
40 when we pop out (40 when we pop out)
Should've worked the sanitation ha I bring the mop out (boy I bring the mop out)
Pass that boy the strap he ain't even shoot that boy a cop out
He think he put in work we make a pussy nigga clock out
Ezo what you doin' with that gat bitch I'll blast out
If a nigga play with my cash imma crash out
Ezo do you do all that shit that you rap bout
Like please just go ask all my ops if I spazz out (bitch I spazz out)
Play my cards right I be so solitary aye
Niggas act like bitches just like Tyler Perry aye
Grab the grippy in the booth I be so cautionary
If he talk I make him mute ion need no commentary
Ian tryna fist fight run n get the mop bitch
Shout out my boy midnight 209 mop shit
That's windpipe he was on some op shit
You know that the clique tight we be on some hot shit
You might also like[Chorus]
It's a mark on my back so this jock on my waistline

When I be whippin' in the front two niggas boomin' in the back
Tell 'em I'm with all the smoke lil' nigga do you want a match (do you want a match)
Why you braggin' 'bout that bitch I put that thooter on the map
Tell her I just want the brain, bitch your medulla on my lap (medulla on my lap) aye

[Verse]
You ain't bout that shit so quit pretendin' aye
If I get caught with this weapon imma felon aye
Those two phrases why these niggas offended aye
Imma hit boy I don't think bitch I just send it aye
Aye bitch we got that dirty like a porta potty
We got weed and we got white and we got more of the molly aye
Pocket rocket pop out with that quarter on me aye
Spot out I been fold 'em just like origami aye
Imma rap til' I hit a hundred racks
Baby tray 80 on me I call that bitch my Thundercat
I had fun with that when shawty took it from the back
When I'm done with that I promise ain't no way I'm coming back
Ian tryna fist fight run n get the mop bitch
Shout out my boy midnight 209 mop shit
Aimin' at his windpipe he was on some op shit
You know that the clique tight we be on some hot shit
