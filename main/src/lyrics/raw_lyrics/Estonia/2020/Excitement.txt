[Refrain: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Sex ain't the only thing that's on my mind
But you get me so excited, woah

Tattoos from your neck that drop down to your ankles
Drop-top in the Range, shawty, you wanna feel good
I wanna feel good, too
Don't I make you feel good?
You get me so excited (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Shawty wanna roll with a rock star
Baby, let's go, we can go far
Yeah, watch the stars and go far

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident
Shawty, your body is so exciting
I love when you get on top and you ride it
Only in your ocean, you call me Ho-seidon
In control of your water, you're lovin' my trident
