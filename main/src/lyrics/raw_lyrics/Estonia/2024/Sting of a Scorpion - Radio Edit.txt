You're fighting for a better life
The blues just makes your needs arrive
But makes illusions fly away
You're giving all that you can give
Your life is hard and wild to live
And makes you try and pay and stay
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Like a sting of a scorpion
Your eyes are hurting me with a touch of pleasure
At the end when the pain is gone
The darkness makes me feel like a shadow queen
Like a sting of a scorpion
Your hand is giving me kinds of heat and treasure
And my heart keeps me moving on
To reach a land of stars I have never seen

[Verse 2]
I find the secrets in your eyes
And feel the spine of bloody lies
That make the sorrows say good bye
I turn my thoughts to killing fears
And hear you whisper in my ears
That love and truth will never die
Yeah yeah yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
Like a sting of a scorpion
Your eyes are hurting me with a touch of pleasure
At the end when the pain is gone
The darkness makes me feel like a shadow queen
Like a sting of a scorpion
Your hand is giving me kinds of heat and treasure
And my heart keeps me moving on
To reach a land of stars I have never seen

[Post-Chorus]
Like a sting - like a sting - like a sting of a scorpion
Like a sting - like a sting - like a sting of a scorpion

[Bridge]
Uuuuhhhh aaaahhhh aaaahhhh

[Chorus]
Like a sting of a scorpion
Your eyes are hurting me with a touch of pleasure
At the end when the pain is gone
The darkness makes me feel like a shadow queen
Like a sting of a scorpion
Your hand is giving me kinds of heat and treasure
And my heart keeps me moving on
To reach a land of stars I have never seen
[Post-Chorus]
Like a sting - like a sting - like a sting of a scorpion
Like a sting - like a sting - like a sting of a scorpion
