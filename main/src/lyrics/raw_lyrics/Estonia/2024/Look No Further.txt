Trough the night and morning
When the rain is pouring
You're the one I'm calling
You're my escape from my darkest days
And when the sun is shining
You know we out here riding
Chasing the horizon with you, you

[Chorus]
I don't need to look no further
You are the one, I'm certain
Only one that I'll be holding
When you're loving me, you're loving me
It goes like

[Drop]
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm
Look no further, look no further
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm
Look no further
It goes like
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm
Look no further, look no further
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm
Look no further
It goes like

A lovе that feels so perfect

All the world is looking for
Show them all we got and
Never look back, never let go

[Chorus]
I don't need to look no further
You are the one, I'm certain
Only one that I'll be holding
When you're loving me, you're loving me
It goes like

[Drop]
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmm
Look no further, look no further

Look no further, look no further

I believe that we are more
All the world is looking for
Show them all we got and
Never look back, never let go

[Chorus]
I don't need to look no further
You are the one, I'm certain
Only one that I'll be holding
When you're loving me, you're loving me
It goes like
