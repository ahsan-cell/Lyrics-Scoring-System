You hit me like a waterfall
Wash me over, now I want it all
Once I got it I won't let it go
I don't wanna let the water fall

[Verse 1]
I'm in the deep
Forget to breathe
Feel it rushing over me
Feel you rushing over me
I prayed for rain
And then you came
I feel it rushing over me
Now you're the only air I need

[Pre-Chorus]
All at once, endless emotion
Crashing hard, into your ocean
Pouring down
Love like I've never known

[Chorus]
You hit me like a waterfall
Wash me over, now I want it all
Once I goti it I won't let it go
I don't wanna lеt the water fall
You hit me likе a waterfall
Wash me over, now I want it all
Once I got it I won't let it go
I don't wanna let the water fall

[Verse 2]
You're tidal wave
My saving grace
Save me from a lonely heart
Now I'm driftin' in your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
All at once, endless emotion
Crashing hard, into your ocean
Pouring down
Love like I've never known

[Chorus]
You hit me like a waterfall
Wash me over, now I want it all
Once I got it I won't let it go
I won't let it go
You hit me like a waterfall
You hit me like a waterfall
Watch me over, now I want it all

One step there and I won't let it go
I don't wanna let the water fall
