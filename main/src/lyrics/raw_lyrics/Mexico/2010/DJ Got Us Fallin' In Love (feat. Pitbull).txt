Usher, Usher, Usher
Yeah, man

[Verse 1]
So we back in the club
With our bodies rockin' from
Side to side, side-side to side
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie
Gone back to life, back-back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
Hands up
And suddenly, we all got our hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes
Eyes, eye-eyes

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (Love again)
Yeah, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (L-love again-gain)
So dance, dance like it's the last, last night
Of your life, life, gon' get you right
'Cause, baby, tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again (L-love again-gain)
