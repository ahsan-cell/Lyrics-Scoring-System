Miami confirmed it to me (Gente de Zona)
Puerto Rico gave it to me (Marc Anthony)
Dominican already played it (Yelelei, yelelei, oh-oh)
And we're from the Carribbean, you and me (Put it on!)

[Chorus: Alexander Delgado, All, Marc Anthony & Randy Malcom]
And the big party was started (Let's go!)
Miami confirmed it to me (And what did they confirm?)
And the rice with beans
Puerto Rico gave it to me (Get 'em, Alex)
And the merengue drum
Dominican already played it (Again, crazy guy)
With Mеxico, Colombia, and Venezuela
And wе're from the Carribbean, you and me (Randy Malcom)

[Verse 1: Randy Malcom, Marc Anthony & Alexander Delgado]
Things are tough, things are divine
Peru with Honduras, Chile with Argentina
Panama brings the sandunga, Ecuador brings "Bilirrubina"
And Uruguay with Paraguay, brothers with Costa Rica
Bolivia is coming
Brazil is already on its way
The world is joining in
On the party of the Latinos (Put it on!)

If you're Latino (Oh-oh-oh)
Hoist your flag (Put it on; one, two, three)
