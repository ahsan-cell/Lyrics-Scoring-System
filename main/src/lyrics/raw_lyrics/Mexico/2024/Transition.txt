YB, Stockholm
I'm locked up, seven floors up, no fresh air
Burned out, I can't see a cop today
Damn I hate being in the hands of the state

[Verse 1]
Money comes, money goes, time to change the purpose
Next year I'm balling out, as if it was my last year
A summer evening in Östermalm, top-down it's only Dior
Kids ask for a picture, they know I come from what they're coming from
Time to give back now, want to build a new Mosque
My sister just graduated, I swear on God your awesome
If my little brother takes it hе will get a Porsche 911
Self-madе, self-made, we do it ourselves
We talk a lot but why has nothing happened yet?
Hash, it's rolled, why has nothing happened yet?
The bottle is here baby, come and drink it
(Pour up and say "Free my people")

[Chorus]
I'm locked up, seven floors up, no fresh air
Burned out, I can't see a cop today
Damn I hate being in the hands of the state
Roll up and sing free my people
I said to mom can you send a couple of blessing my way
Look I'm free from people, soon free from my cell
I'm grown up, soon free from myself
You might also like[Verse 2]
It can take a moment to realize what you actually got
Mine and Amr's relationship is worth more than a thousand hectares
Mine and Zaki's relationship goes back to our younger days
Endgame, we've been trying to pull this off for years
Ownership, now I own things
Before everything I owned was the clothes I had on
I said to Franky until next time
I keep my head high, will actually listen to your advice
Start to think about my own ass
It's not easy to sleep anymore, thoughts they fuck me
To travel away alone is something I should buy myself
Shit, I want to have a G3, that's how I feel
Have parties the whole year (Shit that doesn't sound dumb)

[Chorus]
I'm locked up, seven floors up, no fresh air
Burned out, I can't see a cop today
Damn I hate being in the hands of the state
Roll up and sing free my people
I said to mom can you send a couple of blessing my way
Look I'm free from people, soon free from my cell
I'm grown up, soon free from myself

[Outro]
Roll up and sing free my people
Roll up and sing free my people
Roll up and sing free my people
Roll up and sing free my people
