Now we're down to saying our goodbyes
And you still don't see the truth
All I did was try to make life better for you
But a woman just gets tired of being used

So find another fool to love you
The world is full of girls like me
Find a fool to take care of you
That's a girl I'd like to see
Who'll be the one when all is said and done
I know you
You'll find another fool

Now you say you want to talk it over
Maybe I will change my mind
But you never heard a word I ever told you
And it's not my mind that needs to change this time

So find another fool to love you
The world is full of girls like me
Find a fool to take care of you
That's a girl I'd like to see
You'll be fine but you won't know what she needs
And I know you
You'll find another fool
You might also likeYou think hearts are made to be broken
Like your promises so easily broken
Too many good things have fallen at your feet
I wonder who'll be the fool after me

Go find another fool to love you
The world is full of girls like me
Find a fool to take care of you
That's a girl I'd like to see
I hope she doesn't mind
When you don't come home at night
Not all the time
Maybe once in a while
You tell her that you tried
But you can't look her in the eye
And I know you
You'll find another fool
