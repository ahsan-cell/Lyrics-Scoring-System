Ya know
I might not be exactly where I wanna be
But I'm a lot closer to that point than where I was when I started
But it's had its tests along the way
So what I present to you today
Is my testimony
J-A-Y!

(Verse 1: J.J. Sanders)
Jay did
Distinguished gentleman, not the one you can play with
If niggas didn't like me before, then they finna hate this
It's not bout how you throw, it's how you respond when you take hits
I walked through the fire and didn't get burned it's like I'm made for this
I feel a little Wildеr like Deontay cause til this day and shit
I'm still standing, command еvery room that I stand in
You'll never stand in, my shoes, I move sharper than Shannon (New Carolina!)
Fo nickels blasting, Saint Nicholas with a cannon
Tis the season of giving I'm feeling like he should have ten
Niggas make it seem like they down, them niggas acting
They wanna know my next moves, just depends on who's asking
Are they well wishing? Or listening just to listen
Or projecting their insecurities on you to limit your vision?
Are they really proud of you? Or more surprised that you did it?
I don't regret the things I've done
I tend to dwell on things I didn't
I shouldn't trip over the past
But that's just how I'm living
Think bout my people that have passed
Then I get in my feelings
Then I get deeper in my bag
Life wasn't as bad when I was with em
Shit is sad, but I just keep grinding cause I can't stop just cause I miss em
So to Jeff, Paula, and granny, long live em
And to my 8, big bro I'ma finish your mission
It's gone hurt at graduation when I see ya seat empty
But I'ma push through like a champ
Guess that's the Jerry Leazer in me
Might not be here in the flesh, but everywhere you'll see them with me
Questioned God about a lot, so I just pray that he forgives me
The mic's my confidant, so as I pass this off to Billy
Like I'm Drake in 2010, when I'm gone I hope you miss me (Jay)

Revfia!
Now I just wake up, count my paper
This Maserati got me feeling like I'm on the Lakers
When you get money they be acting like they fucking hate ya
I took a trip to LAX just to see Jamaica
Now let me tell you just what God did
He put the pressure on the boy to make a diamond
So you know everywhere I step, a nigga shining
I feel like Michael, Billie Jean the way I'm sliding
Niggas say they real but they just made up
I ain't never working for no pay cut
Visions from the past, like I came up
Looking in the mirror, like he made one
Money in my pocket, gotta stay up
I been out here grinding, better pay up
Gotta keep my focus til the game's won
This shit like a series, it's just game one
It's just game, Revfia

(Verse 3: Bizzy Bailey)
It's game time, isolate give me floor space
So far ahead I'm having memories of the Lord's face
In mental prison, placed as children with no court case
Sitting on a cloud feeling better, was under weather
I was sick of feeling stuck under pressure, I made it precious
Now I'm on a cloud reigning over, lose the umbrella
Know I'm dropping cats and dogs, fuck a kennel, you'll need a cellar nigga
Things get hella bad, get propellers, can't let the devil getcha
Try to bring you down below standard so they can level with ya
Kids is toting irons now, ain't no peace as it meddles which in
4K, I'll spit you a verse that gives you a better picture
I did, break out the shackles, picked up the gavel
Try to judge me, leave you leaning piazza Tower of Babel
Scripture scribble every now and then
Scratch it the music itches
Been living life on fourth and inches, I gotta kick it
Habits that I formed cloud my vision and cause division
It's like nothing adds up, stop the dribble, you gotta pivot
Stop and make decisions and live with it don't forget it
Killing all these rappers, he speaking life with these lyrics
On the other hand, facing failures when tryna elevate
Ain't no way in hell, before I lose I'll make the devil pray
The day I die, the late great making heaven wait
Angels standing at the great gate, had to meditate
No make up on, but every problem I'm prepared to face
You know success can scare a legend, make 'em stand in place
Ever seen a dog start to whimper because he scared to chase?
Pretend gravity don't exist my nigga, never wait
I told the woman of my dreams we gotta separate
Because respect for one another doesn't resonate
Sometimes I feel like fuck living cause I can't relate
To situations normal people reach and learn to levitate
Level up
Tryna do this therapy and medicate
Without the streets drugs I run to and never can escape
Just bare with me give me a minute I feel like I'm venting
I haven't touched the microphone, the shit inside been building
I love you Rosalyn, way I'm living been kind of different
That's why I gotta fix it, this DNA for my children
Standing on my six, but ain't straight up, been feeling crippled
Strolling through the darkest of times, but I'll never give up
I'll never die if I gotta be the one who ain't live up
To my expectations, fuck where you thought I would end up
Or who I would be, cause who I am is still that nigga
That had foresight to share his magic to these niggas
The greatest to do it, I feel like Cassius to niggas
I show em they sweet, I'm like a cavity to niggas
What God did was make me the masterpiece Bizzy
I'm glad to be the difference
Quan Did!
(Verse 4: Eriq Trilly)
Gotta compare me to the Gods bringing the rhymes kid
A lot of pressure, but don't show it like LeBron kids
Time spent, reminiscing bout my crime stint
Starting to believe that I ain't even hit my prime yet
A prime vet, I won't never be a shrine pet
Mind's scrambled, I ain't really fuck with fried eggs
Across from Trilly verse, I'm Eriq but my mind fed
Eyes wept, mourning losses of some great friends
When the Lord call ya number, ain't no make amends
Go with the flow like depends
I hear your raps and I cringe
I remember I was addicted to xanz and I binge
For like three months and fucked this up, trying to die was the plan
At least I didn't but looking back, that's what it had to have been
Look at me now, I'm a father, it was a part of the plan
But now I'm thankful for my seed, now I'm a vessel for him
Enough of the pleasantries, I'm number one in this bitch
Somebody said they was ill as me
The only comp I ever seen was actually me and Q-Lean, addictive like cups of lean
Come fuck with the winning team
Shawty say it don't take a lot for her to remember me
Niggas try to discredit, be tryna belittle me
Really acclaimed critically, I mean that shit literally
Niggas ain't got the synergy to fuck with me lyrically
Niggas ain't got the mind and soul to fuck with me mentally nigga
I said
Niggas ain't got the synergy to fuck with me lyrically
Niggas ain't got the mind and soul to fuck with me mentally bitch
That's what God did
