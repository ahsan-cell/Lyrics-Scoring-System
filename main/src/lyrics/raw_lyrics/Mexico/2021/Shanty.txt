And fix me something good to eat
And make my head a little high
And make the whole day complete
'Cause we gonna lay around the shanty, mama
And put a good buzz on

Well, pass it to me baby
Pass it to me slow
We'll take time out to smile a little
Before we let it go
'Cause we gonna lay around the shanty, mama
And put a good buzz on

Well, there ain't nothin' to do
And there's always room for more
Fill it, light it, shut up
And close the door
'Cause we gonna lay around the shanty, mama
And put a good buzz on

We gonna sit around the kitchen
Fix us somethin' good to eat
And make ourselves a little high
And make the whole day complete
'Cause we gonna lay around the shanty, mama
And put a good buzz on
'Cause we gonna lay around the shanty, mama
And put a good buzz onYou might also like
