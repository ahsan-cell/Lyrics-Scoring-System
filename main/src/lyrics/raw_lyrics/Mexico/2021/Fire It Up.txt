Yo Kony 2012
Back in the game
Sad squad in your face
Sad squad
Fire (x4)

[Verse 1]
I have a notebook
I write fire in
My notebook's red
Like blood Kanye said
Blood on the leaves
Creepers blowing up Steve
Nerd games, hard phase
Pretty face, big waist
Don't slut shame girls' bodies
Seriously feminism
Also boys can wear nail polish too
Sadism

[Verse 2]
Aesthetically pleasing your ears with my flow
Y'all hoes know I'm a dragon spittin fire
Green means go, oh no I think I'm killin y'all homies I better go slow hell no
Yung lean ain't got nothing on me
From my grades to my raps you can't touch Joshy G
Mean girls reference
Means girls is illuminati
There's three of them Seriously, think about it
You might also like[Hook]
I know there's
A picture of me
In the dictionary,next to fire and beautiful
I'm a low key ten
Man buns are in, Cause I started that trend
At Montwood (x3)
I started that trend

[Bridge]
Sad squad
Satan sucks
Kony 2012

[Verse 3]
Sad squad in the room
Acting like goons
Going 50 in the 15
School zones
Oh no I better slow down
It's messin up my flow
Stay in school though
My pops dropped out but he's making them Ben's
My life's a wreck
Your rhymes a mess
Your tapes are trash
My tapes are clutch
I'm out
[Outro]
Hottest mixtape you'll hear in 2015
And I ain't even Drake
Keep J.C. in your heart and your hands off your PP's1
