I like pie, I like cake
Anything that they bake
And I like crackers too
Broken up in a stew

[Verse Two]
When I see jelly roll
I lose all my control
But of all those things
I like you best of all

[Verse Three]
I like ma
I like pa
Like how old muse hee haw [??]
Like it down on the farm
Like the wheat and the corn
Like the birds in the trees
Like the flowers and the bees
But of all those things
I like you best of all

I like toast smeared with jam
Collared greens
Sugared ham
I like crawfish étoufféе
Like my coffee with beignet
I likе beans and sweet potatoes
Cabbage slaw and green tomatoes
But of all those things
I like you best of allYou might also like
