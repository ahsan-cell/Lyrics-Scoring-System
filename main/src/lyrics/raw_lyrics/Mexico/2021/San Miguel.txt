I didn't leave my heart in San Francisco
Left it with a pretty se√±orita in San Miguel
When the sun comes up on Sunday morning
I'll be strolling down the cobble stone street
To the mission bell

[Chorus]
There's magic in the air, laughter everywhere
The jacarandas in bloom
We make love in the morning
Siesta in the afternoon
But the night time is the right time
That's when I fell
It's easy to fall in love in San Miguel

[Verse 2]
The people on the street, they're oh so friendly
Seems that they just can't wait to wish you well
I could hardly speak when she said "que la noche"
Right there, right then I fell under the spell

[Chorus]
There's magic in the air, laughter everywhere
The jacarandas in bloom
Make love in the morning
Siesta in the afternoon
But the night time is the right time
That's when I fell
It's easy to fall in love in San Miguel
It's easy to fall in love with San MiguelYou might also like
