I'm goin' up the country, baby don't you wanna go?
I'm goin' to some place where I've never been before

Well, I'm goin', I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
I'm goin' where the water tastes like wine
We can jump in the water and stay drunk all the time

I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
I'm gonna leave this city, got to get away
All this fussin' and fightin', man, you know I sure can't stay

Now baby, packin' up the truck you know I got to leave today
Just exactly where I'm goin' I cannot say
We might even leave the USA
'Cause it's a brand-new game and I wanna play

No use of you running or screaming and crying
But you got a home, girl, long as I got mineYou might also like
