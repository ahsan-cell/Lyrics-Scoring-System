What's that I see
Is that her on her way back home
Or do my eyes deceive

We had a falling out the night before
She said she was goin' away
She put on a coat, walked to the door
What was I to say

I said, please, think about the good time we had
I said, please, think about the good times, not the bad

I spent yesterday wondering aimlessly
My head down I was blue
I couldn't believe it happened to me
I cried like a fool

Who could say and do the right thing every time
When it comes to love
Who don't stumble every once in a while
Tell me whose above it

Please, think about the good time we had
I said, please, think about the good times, not the bad
You might also likeYou know what I'm talking about, don't it happen to everyone
It'll carve a hole in your heart, like a bullet from a gun
What's that sound, what's that I hear
Is that her key unlocking the door or is there something wrong with my ear

I said, please, think about the good times we had
I said, please, think about the good times, not the bad

Please, think about the good times we had
Please, think about the good times, not the bad
