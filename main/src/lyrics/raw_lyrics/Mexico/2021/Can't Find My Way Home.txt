And leave your body alone
Somebody's got to change
You are the reason
I have been waiting for so long
Somebody holds the key
And it ain't me

Well, I'm near the end
And I just ain't got the time
What's more I'm wasted
And can't find my way home

Come down on your own
And leave your money at home
Somebody's got to change
You are the reason
I have been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key

Well, I'm near the end
And I just ain't got the time

What's more I'm wasted
And I can't find my way home
You might also likeCome down off your throne
And leave your body alone
Somebody's got to change
You are the reason I have been
Waiting for so long
Somebody holds the key
And it ain't me

Well, I'm near the end
And I just ain't got the time
What's more I'm wasted
And can't find my way home

What's more I'm wasted
And can't find my way home

What's more I'm wasted
And can't find my way home
