I don't know why I love you like I do
After all them changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I ain't seen how to have you yet

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know
Oh, won't you'll tell me?
Just tell me how, how could I stay
Here with you?

[Chorus]
Oh, will you take me to the river
And wash me down?
Just take me to the river
Put my feet back on the ground

[Verse 2]
I don't know why you treated me so bad
After all the good times that we could have had
Love is an ocean that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I would never regret

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know
Oh, won't you tell me?
Tell me how, how could I stay
Here with you?
You might also like[Chorus]
You gotta take me to the river
And help me wash me down
Just take me to the river
Put my feet back on the ground

[Bridge]
Hold me, squeeze me
Hold me and you can tease me
Until I can't take no more
Oh, no more, no more, no more

[Verse 3]
I just don't know why I love you like I do
After all them changes that you put me through
Your sixteen candles, they burn on my wall
Now who's the biggest fool of us all?

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know
Oh, won't you tell me?
Just tell me how, how could I stay
Here with you?

[Chorus]
Oh, will you take me to the river
And help wash me down?
Just take me to the river
Put my feet back on the ground
Oh, will you take me to the river
And help wash me down?
Oh, will you take me to the river
Put my feet back on the ground
