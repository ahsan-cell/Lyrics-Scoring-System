Tell me that the good times roll
Tell me I could live as half a man
Loving you's what made me whole
There was a time when I could sing to you
I live for the light that I could bring to you
But I sat down to sing a lonely song
God knows I never thought that it could last so long

Now all the day's dressed in gray
They come home to stay
And they've laid their cold arms all around
Graveyard flowers lost in grey showers
All my leaves are turning brown
The way home is all I need to know
All I hear is "I told you so"
The timе has come to find me now
The timе has come to teach you how

Cause all you need is love to find me
And you don't need to find too (??)
If I'm lost in the dark you just turn on your heart
And leave those dogs at home
Cause it don't take much for me to see the light
A loving touch makes you shine so bright
No it don't take much for me to see you coming
Turn on that light, yes, you know I come running

If I'm lost in the dark you turn on your heart
And leave those dogs at home
Cause it don't take much for me to see the light
A loving touch makes you shine so bright
It don't take much for me to see you coming
Turn on that light, yes, you know I come
I come running
