I want to feel your body next to mine
Because my soul has been
Feeling cold for some time
If you want it, come closer together with me
Little by little very slowly
Cuz I'm feeling more than good
Slide up to the corner
I'll love up on you little by little

[Pre-Chorus]
Try it
If you want it that way
Try it
Go from north to south
Try it
I'm only yours
(don't leave me without your love)
Try it
If you want it that way
Try it
Go from north to south
Try it
I'm only yours
(don't leave me without your love)
You might also like[Chorus]
I like it
It scares me to feel your body
Burning on my skin
It turns me on
It excites me to feel your breath
Burning my whole being

[Verse]
I want to feel your body next to mine
Becausе my soul has been
Feeling cold for some time
If you want it, come closеr together with me
Little by little very slowly
Cuz I'm feeling more than good
Slide up to the corner
I'll love up on you little by little

[Pre-Chorus]
Try it
If you want it that way
Try it
Go from north to south
Try it
That I'm only yours
(don't leave me without your love)
Try it
If you want it that way
Try it
Go from north to south
Try it
That I'm only yours
(don't leave me without your love)
[Chorus]
I like it
It scares me to feel your body
Burning on my skin
Turns me on
It lights me up to feel your breath
Burning my whole being

[Other]
Turns me on
Turns me on
Turns me on
Lights me up
Turns me on
Turns me on
Turns me on
Turns me on
