I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they saw me happy, no, no, it ain't true

[Verse 1: Payo Solís]
Nothing makes me laugh anymore
Only when I see the pictures and videos I have of you
I went out with someone else to forget you
And I had the perfume that you like
I light up to go to sleep
Because I sleep better if I dream that you're here
If you knеw that I wrote you
I haven't sent thе messages, they're all still there
Wow, how much its cost me
Maybe I did you a favor when I left your side
Drunk looking at your pictures, it hurts me to see that you did get better
You don't have grey days, your scars don't hurt anymore
And I'm wondering if I should tell you that

[Chorus: Payo Solis & Bad Bunny]
I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they saw me happy, no, no, it ain't true (Ayy)

It's been while since I thought about you
Drunk on your Insta, I logged in
Baby, I already know that you're doing good
That you don't want to know about me, ayy, ayy
Living in an inferno and I set myself on fire
Playing with you like I'm number ten
I feel like I'm no longer in your heart, now I'm at your feet
Begging for you, drowning myself in the tequila
The boys are asking me out
I'm having a good time, but I always end up missing you
Drowning myself in the tequila, ayy
These young women texting me, ayy
Where are we getting wasted today, but

[Chorus: Bad Bunny]
I have 1% left
And I'll use it just to tell you how sorry I am
If they see me with someone else at a disco, it's just wasting time
Baby, why would I lie to you?
If they say they see me happy, no, it ain't true
