Rodri Molina made it happen in China
It's the Mesa Tra, all the booties to the back
With me, you're going to escape, baby
I'm going to take you to the dark
Tell your friends you're going somewhere else
But you're actually coming here

[Pre-Chorus: Mesita]
Fro-fro-from ten to six
Rolling a Phillie blunt while driving the V6
Like Bonnie and Clyde, we're outside the law
In the dark, doing Fifty Shades of Grey

[Chorus: Mesita]
Ta-ta-take a photo for me(-to), let them see us
In the whip while we do nasty things
Baby, that booty (-ty) is so sexy
If they say I'm a bandit, don't believe them

[Post-Chorus: Mesita & Emilia]
With you, I'm at a hundred
Smoke in the windows of my Mercedes-Benz
I can't hold back, baby, you're top ten
Let's go to bed, where no one can see us (Emilia, baby)
You might also like[Verse 1: Emilia]
I don't want a photo, let's make it real
Daddy, you've passed my quality control
I took off my clothes and gave you the chills
I'm the original who thrills you in private
I-I-I like it when you watch me
When we're lighting up the blunt inside the room
Doing nasty things
A selfie in the big machine, in position
Baby, when I go down, he likes it, it scares him
He knows I'm his kitty, in bed I'm a—, shh
I'm going to punish you for your bad behavior
If we go out together, we'll get a few likes

[Chorus: Emilia]
Ta-ta-take a photo for me (-to), let them see us (See us)
In the whip while we do nasty things
Baby, that booty (-ty) is so sexy (Ah)
If they say I'm a bandit, don't believe them

[Post-Chorus: Tiago PZK & Emilia]
With you, I'm at a hundred (Hundred, hundred)
Smoke in the windows of my Mercedes-Benz (Benz, Benz)
I can't hold back, baby, you're top ten (Ten, ten)
Let's go to bed, where no one can see us (No one can see us, no one can see us)
[Verse 2: Tiago PZK]
If I call her, she gets active, comes with her friends
They bring plenty of weed, goes to the party without panties
That excites me, I'm gonna punish her
Breaking her in half 'cause it's satire
With you, bad girl, I want a daring photo
To see every day and remember when you were wet on top
A photo on all fours and another one in 4K
I'll keep it, this one won't be on OnlyFans
Let's go to my bed, let's finish the plan (This is the remix)

[Chorus: Tiago PZK & NICKI NICOLE, NICKI NICOLE & Mesita]
Ta-ta-take a photo for me (-to), let them see us
In the whip while we do nasty things
Baby, that booty (-ty) is so sexy (Ah)
If they say I'm a bandit, don't believe them
Ta-ta-take a photo for me (-to), let them see us (Ah)
In the whip while we do nasty things
Baby, that booty (-ty) is so sexy
If they say I'm a bandit, don't believe them
Ta-ta-take a photo for me

[Verse 3: NICKI NICOLE]
We upload it and let everyone know, know, know
That in that ride, I'm the pilot
And if your girlfriend wants, we'll do another one, do another one
Little eyes, she looked at me, I looked at her
We went on a trip, she wanted it and I let her
We got to my place, I put her in one more three
She knows who I am, she wants me to give it to her (Bad girl)
For love, I have a difficult master's degree
But if you want, I'll make it easy
I hear her scream, she says, "NICKI"
A killer, she's a freaky
[Chorus: Mesita]
Ta-ta-take a photo for me (-to), let them see us
In the whip while we do nasty things
Baby, that booty (-ty) is so sexy
If they say I'm a bandi— (It's Mesa Tra)

[Verse 4: Mesita]
Ta-ta-take a nude for me (Ah)
It's no longer a photo, it's a video for RedTube (Okay)
Of all the girls, the most satirical I've had (Ey, ey)
Light up that cannon, let's do it on a cloud (To the ride we go)
Let's go to bed and light up a Phillie blunt
You like fame and spending millions
What high-end flow, baby, you're killing it
Moving that booty against the wall
And you like it when I hit it, eh-eh
Up on the wick and reversed, eh-eh
Let's do it where no one can see, eh-eh
Baby, that badge is on TV in my Mercedes-Benz

[Chorus: Mesita]
Ta-ta-take a photo for me(-to), let them see us
In the whip while we do nasty things
Baby, that booty (-ty) is so sexy
If they say I'm a bandit, don't believe them

[Post-Chorus: Mesita]
With you, I'm at a hundred
Smoke in the windows of my Mercedes-Benz
I can't hold back, baby, you're top ten
Let's go to bed, where no one can see us
