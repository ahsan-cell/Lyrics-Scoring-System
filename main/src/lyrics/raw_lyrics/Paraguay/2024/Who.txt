We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

[Verse 1]
If every day I think about her
Yeah, every day of my life
Then tell me why I haven't found her
(Why, why, why, why, why?)

[Pre-Chorus]
There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love

[Chorus]
We nevеr met, but she's all I see at night
Nevеr met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

[Verse 2]
I'll take her places they ain't found yet
I'll put it all on the line
I'll be that someone she can count on
One, two, three, four, five

There's so many people to see (There's so many people to see)
And places to go (There's so many places to go)
I still haven't found your love

[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?

[Bridge]
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my heart) Heart waiting for?
(Who is my—) Who is my heart waiting for?

[Chorus]
We never met, but she's all I see at night
Never met, but she's always on my mind
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
Is she someone that I see every day?
Is she somewhere a thousand miles away?
Wanna give her the world and so much more
Who is my heart waiting for?
