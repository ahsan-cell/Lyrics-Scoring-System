My sweet summer is gone
She left me here
With sand in my bed
She played me all night long
But I'd do it all over again, Oohh
My sweet summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear
Her lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone
My sweet summer is gone

[Verse 1: Duddy B]
Warm was the weather outside the day we met
Blue was the color of skies the day she left
Short was the time we had, it was the best
'Cause long were the nights we spent with no rest
I met her on a Friday, she left on a Monday
Wrote me a letter, said she hoped to see me someday
We had a good time, I can't deny that
You can be my sunshine every time you fly back

[Pre-Chorus: Dirty J]
'Cause there's another one you're loving
And I hate to see you go

My sweet summer is gone
She left me here
With sand in my bed
She played me all night long
But I'd do it all over again, Oohh
My sweet summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear
Her lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone
My sweet summer is gone

[Verse 2: Duddy B]
Yeah she left in the morning, gone without warning
Fun while it lasted, lost in the moment
She played me real good, took me for a ride
Now she's off on an airplane, back to real life
Yeah she dipped out
Smoked all my weed then she flipped out
Left in my slumber, waited 'til I passed out
And on my dresser was a paper and her number
I filled up with grass and I burned it, for summer

[Pre-Chorus: Dirty J]
'Cause there's another one you're loving
And I hate to see you go
[Chorus: Dirty J]
My sweet summer is gone
She left me here
With sand in my bed
She played me all night long
But I'd do it all over again, Oohh
My sweet summer is gone
And on my mirror, she made it clear
Her lipstick can't be wrong
My summer, summer, my sweet summer is gone
My sweet summer is gone

[Bridge: Dirty J]
Left like a midnight thief
You ain't no friend to me
How could you lead me on?
Now my sweet summer is gone

[Outro: Dirty J]
My sweet summer is gone
Now my sweet summer is gone
My sweet summer is gone
Now my sweet summer is gone9
