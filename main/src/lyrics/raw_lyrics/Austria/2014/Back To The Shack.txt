Sorry guys, I didn't realize that I needed you so much
I thought I'd get a new audience, I forgot that disco sucks
I ended up with nobody and I started feelin' dumb
Maybe I should play the lead guitar and Pat should play the drums

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go
Back to the shack

[Verse 2]
I finally settled down with my girl and I made up with my dad
Had to go and make a few mistakes so I could find out who I am
I'm lettin' all of these feelings out even if it means I fail
'Cause this is what I was meant to do and you can't put that on sale

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go
Back to the shack

We belong in the rock world
There is so much left to do
If we die in obscurity, oh well
At least we raised some hell

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Take me back, back to the shack
Back to the strat with the lightning strap
Kick in the door, more hardcore
Rockin' out like it's '94
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go
Back to the shack
Let's turn up the radio
Turn off those stupid singing shows
I know where we need to go
Back to the shack

[Outro]
