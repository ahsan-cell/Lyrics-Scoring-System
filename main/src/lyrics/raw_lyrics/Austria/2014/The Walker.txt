Ooh, crazy's what they think about me
Ain't gonna stop 'cause they tell me so
'Cause 99 miles per hour baby
Is how fast that I'd like to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't keep up with my rhythm though they keep trying
Too quick for the lines they throw
I walk to the sound of my own drum
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feed this heart, it takes control
Really need it, need it

[Verse 2]
I wake up to the city of angels
To see my name headline the coast
They say I'm a walking dreamer, baby
If I stop they would make the show

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't keep up with my rhythm though they keep trying
Too quick for the lines they throw
I walk to the sound of my own drum
It goes, they go, we go, hey yeah yeah yeah

Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feed this heart, it takes control
Really need it, need it
Hey, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feed this heart, it takes control
Really need it, need it

[Bridge]
Everybody walk
Everybody walk
Everybody walk, walk, walk, walk, walk

[Chorus]
Oh, here we go
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feed this heart, it takes control
Really need it, need it
(I need to know) oh, here we go (get in and go)
Feel it in my soul
Really need it, need it, so go
Gotta feed this heart, it takes control
Really need it, need it15
