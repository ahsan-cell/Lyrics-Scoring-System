Love, it was enough to recognize
To see, I was the reason you feel sick inside

[Chorus]
Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, I may be
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, I

[Verse 2]
Love, it cut a hole into your eyes
You couldn't see you were the car I crashed
Now you're burning alive

[Chorus]
Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, baby
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, I

[Bridge]
Babe, the night it swallowed my soul
Could it be that I fell apart? It shows
The lines on the face ate away my smile
Could it be that I fell apart?

Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, baby
Fall in need
I'll let you bleed
'Cause you were fallin', I'm sorry, baby
Fall in need35
