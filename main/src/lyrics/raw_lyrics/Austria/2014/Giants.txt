Rock, chalk, shot a jayhawk
Never been to jail 'cus I never get caught
I got smarts
Dark, dangerous dog, ODB got it right from the start
You got one and you changed from crazy to calm
I've been awake for days in the dusk and the dawn
And you're loving me whether you want to or not
Well I want you for sure, I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more

Who heard
What, no, right from the start
Go sell that shit somewhere farther from the heart
Running and running and running and stop
Come on we both knew this thing would be hard
I see art, you see class
You think, you ask
You say "Darling am I a chore?"

I said I know you love me, I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more

Slip into smiling wildly
After the rest have gone
We become beyond timeless
Give you everything that I have ever owned
Soon I will have bought us up a house and home
Up on the seventh floor

I know you love me I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more

I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more
I am loving you more11
