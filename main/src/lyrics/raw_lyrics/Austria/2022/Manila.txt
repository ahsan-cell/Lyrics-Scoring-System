Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me

[Verse 1: Ray Dalton & Alvaro Soler]
You're runnin' circles 'round your heart (Oh, yeah)
I know it's goin' to be real dark (Oh, yeah)
I take a minute, light a spark (Oh, yeah)
We can dance until the fall
Si te vienes conmigo piénsatelo bien
Vamos a cien por hora, un poco del revés
Porque cuando arrancamos ya no para el tren, еh
Mira que te lo cuento biеn, ieh-eh

[Pre-Chorus: Ray Dalton, Ray Dalton & Alvaro Soler]
Why don't we live? Why don't we live?
Why don't we live just a little bit?
Why don't we stay? Why don't we stay?
Why don't we

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me
Take a chance with me
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Ray Dalton & Alvaro Soler]
(Oh)
And take a chance with me (Ba-da, ba-da)
And take a chance with me

[Verse 2: Alvaro Soler]
Y si mezclamos mi cerveza y tu tequila
Hoy no hay controles de Berlín hasta Manila
Ay, tu sonrisa me parece poesía, yeah
¿Cómo te digo? ¿Cómo te digo yo?

[Pre-Chorus: Ray Dalton, Alvaro Soler, Ray Dalton & Alvaro Soler]
Why don't we live? Why don't we live?
Why don't we live just a little bit?
Why don't we stay? Why don't we stay?
Why don't we (Uh)

[Chorus: Ray Dalton]
Wake up in Manila, ride to Belize
Dive into the ocean and feel a little free
Skies of vanilla, smell it through the breeze
You could be the one, take a chance with me
Take a chance with me

[Post-Chorus: Ray Dalton & Alvaro Soler]
(Oh)
Take a chance with me (Ba-da, ba-da)
And take a chance with me
[Outro: Ray Dalton, Ray Dalton & Alvaro Soler]
Why don't we live? Why don't we live?
Why don't we live just a little bit?
Why don't we stay? Why don't we stay?
Why don't we stay just a little bit?1
