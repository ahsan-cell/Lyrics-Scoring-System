Free, free to be myself
Free to need some time
Free to need some help
So I'm reaching baby, out
When I'm lonely in the crowd
When the sirens get too loud
I'll be crashing on some couch

[Pre-Chorus: Aura Dione]
And even if I never forget you baby
Tonight I'm gonna let your memory baby
Go, always said I know

[Chorus: Aura Dione]
But at least I got my friends
Share a raincoat in the wind
They got my back until the end
If I'll never fall in love again
Well, at least I got my friends
Like a light bulb in the dark
Saving me from the sharks
Even though I got a broken heart
At least I got my friends
Got my friends
Got my friends
Got my friends
Well, at least I got my friends

I just wanna drink, yeah
So pour another round
And throw it back until it's down
Let's get lost until we're found, again and again

[Pre-Chorus: Aura Dione]
And even if I never forget you baby
Tonight I'm gonna let your memory baby
Go, always said I know

[Chorus: Aura Dione]
But at least I got my friends
Share a raincoat in the wind
They got my back until the end
If I'll never fall in love again

Like a light bulb in the dark
Saving me from the sharks
Even though I got a broken heart
At least I got my friends
Got my friends
Got my friends
Got my friends
Well, at least I got my friends
[Verse 3: Tim James]
And when the world is upside down, yeah
The sky is full of clouds yeah
They always come around, it feels like home, like home
And I never have to try, I can be myself and I
Am never alone, I never feel alone, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Aura Dione]
And even if I never forget you baby
Tonight I'm gonna let your memory baby
Go, always said I know

[Chorus: Aura Dione]
But at least I got my friends
Share a raincoat in the wind
They got my back until the end
If I'll never fall in love again
Well, at least I got my friends
Like a light bulb in the dark
Saving me from the sharks
Even though I got a broken heart
At least I got my friends
