We've been waiting for the sun
We've been waiting for the sun
To come out and play
All these rainy days are getting old

[Verse 2]
We've been waiting for the stars
We've been waiting for the stars
Just to light the way and take the night away
And paint us gold

[Chorus]
So no one can catch us, nothing can change this
Covered in stardust, things are golden
Jumping off the edge, reaching for the moon, moon
Living everyday, things all go like

[Hook]
Oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 3]
We are waiting on a dream
We are waiting on a dream
So we go to sleep
But nothing happens when we wait too long
You might also like[Chorus]
So we go and no one can catch us, nothing can change this
Covered in stardust, things are golden
Jumping off the edge, reaching for the moon, moon
Living everyday, things all go like

[Hook]
Oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh!
Oh, oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh!
Oh, oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh!
Oh – oh, oh, hey!
Oh, oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh!
Oh, oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh!
Oh, oh, oh – oh, oh, oh, oh, hey, oh!
Oh – yeah, yeah!

[Chorus]
No one can catch us, nothing can change this
Covered in stardust, things are golden
Jumping off the edge, reaching for the moon, moon
Living everyday, things all go like
No one can catch us, nothing can change this
Covered in stardust, things are golden
Jumping off the edge, reaching for the moon, moon
Living everyday!
