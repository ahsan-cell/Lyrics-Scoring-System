One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

(One day)
(One day)

[Verse]
No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

No more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why
You might also likeNo more tears, my heart is dry
I don't laugh and I don't cry
I don't think about you all the time
But when I do, I wonder why

[Chorus]
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be one
(One Day)

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told

One day baby, we'll be old
Oh baby, we'll be old
And think about all the stories that we could have told
