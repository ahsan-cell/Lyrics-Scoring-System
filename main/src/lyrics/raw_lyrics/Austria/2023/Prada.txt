'Bout to take my lady Selfridges
New drip on the way, uh-huh
Rap nigga still sellin' bricks
Half a cake on the way, uh-huh
Take a flight, she wanna take a Lyft
Phone the molly man, he's on the way, uh-huh
I might take her The Shard, I might take her The Ritz
It don't matter, baby, I'm straight, uh-huh

[Verse 2: RAYE]
I feel like I'm in Prince's house
Purple paint all on the walls, uh-huh
Sittin' down on this fancy couch
And I can't see straight, I'm a state, uh-huh
Twenty-two, I'm in Paris, baby
Got strippers tits in my face, uh-huh
Pull up in a Bentley, I want Christian, I want Fendi

[Chorus: RAYE]
I want Prada, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
I already make that paper, I don't need to chase no clout, wow
I don't usually pipe up, but I don't like how you runnin' your mouth, wow
I already make that papеr, I don't need to chase no clout, wow
I don't usually pipe up, but I don't like how you runnin' your mouth, wow
You a sidе piece from east, then I'm a bad bitch from south, wow
Baby, baby, I got more money comin' in than goin' out
