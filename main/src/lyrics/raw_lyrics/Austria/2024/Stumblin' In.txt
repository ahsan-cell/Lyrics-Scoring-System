Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then, firelight will catch us, stumblin' in

[Verse 1]
Wherever you go
Whatever you do
You know these reckless thoughts of mine are following you
I've fallen for you
Whatever you do
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I never knew

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever it takes
Baby, I'll do it for you

[Chorus]
Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our lovе is a flame
Burning within
Now and then, firelight will catch us, stumblin' in

You wеre so young
Oh, and I was so free
I may have been young, but baby, that's not what I wanted to be
Well, you were the one
Oh, why was it me?
'Cause, baby, you've shown me so many things that I'd never see

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever you need
Baby, you got it from me

[Chorus]
Our love is alive
And so we begin
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
Our love is a flame
Burning within
Now and then, firelight will catch us, stumblin' in

[Outro]
Stumblin' in
Stumblin' in
Foolishly laying our hearts on the table, stumblin' in
