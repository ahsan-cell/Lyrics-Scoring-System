I still believe in your eyes
I just don't care what you've done in your life
Baby, I'll always be here by your side
Don't leave me waiting too long, please come by
I, I still believe in your eyes
There is no choice, I belong to your life
Because I, I live to love you someday
You'll be my baby and we'll fly away

[Chorus]
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you

[Post-Chorus]
You are
You are

[Verse 2]
Every day and every night
I always dream that you are by my side
Oh baby, every day and every night
Well, I said everything's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
And I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
I'll fly with you
