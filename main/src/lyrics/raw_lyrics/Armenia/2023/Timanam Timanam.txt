The graveyard shift
An occultist and I'm lit
Level 99, I'm undead and I'm crawling out and the crypt...
Yeah
Eh
Skeletons up in my fridge, already ate
(Yeah)
I triple up the 6 and ignore all the hate
(6, 6, 6)
Act like a boss
C.E.O of hell
No god
(Eh, C.E.O.)
Show no remorse when I wake up from the coffin
Grab that ouija board and...

We ain’t recruiting no losers
On my own Independence day
You know we bout to get lit, aye
Party in the Underworld
I pull up in the Rolls Royce
People shootin’ shit, they talking’
Who can make the most noise
608 established years ago
I couldn’t give a shit
Ain’t no time to listen while you trying to climb
On my dick, (sssshhh)

SURFING ON MY WAVE
DON’T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU SAY
MY MASTER BEDROOM BIGGER THAN
THE HOTEL LOUNGE WHERE YOU LAY
DREAMING OF CLIMBING TO THE TOP
AFTER THE ONE HIT
DREAMING OF ONE DAY BEING A SKELETON IN MY FRIDGE

[Shush]
I just lit it up before the job interview
Now I'm the C. E. O
Ain't got time to ask no questions
Ain't no D. E. A
