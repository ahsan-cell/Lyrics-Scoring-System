Back Then, Back Then
Wasn't coo back then
Wanted me to tap out
Now they want to tap in
Tap in, Tap in
They ain't built like this
Focused on the right now
Past tense, Past Tense

(Verse 1: Suli4Q)

You know I come as is
Morals never absent
Husband and a dad sh**
Tell me why you mad then
F*** Being average
Throw away ya baggage
Past tense, Past tense
F*** what happened last year
I'm your fix i'm your tool
The elephant in the room
Treat december like june
This the wave they gone cruise
Ain't no way we gone lose
For Attitudes we like brooms
They don't teach class in school
You get respect when you give
I know that we built different
I'm way to hot to be chilling
Ni****
I elected me, I ain't need another man to vote
Don't act like you want a fade
You know you ain't Amber Rose
We move quite most break the news like channel 4
Back when bro BK served the gas like Texaco
Remember
You might also like(Chorus: Suli4Q)

Back Then, Back Then
Wasn't coo back then
Wanted me to tap out
Now they want to tap in
Tap in, Tap in
They ain't built like this
Focused on the right now
Past tense, Past Tense

(Verse 2: Suli4Q)

You know y'all be last minute
Show up when the class finished
Switch sides then get ya rag tinted
Feel a way but be masking it
I pass words like the admin
Bad vibes get kicked out like bad tenants
F*** being average
Throw away your baggage B****
I'm not your cast when you broke
I'm your light i'm your hope
I'm the water to ya boat
I'm the suds to ya soap
I'm not the skies to ya slope
I'm ya hook when you climbing
To my team what Labron is
Perfect timing
'Memba I was tryn-a get it no heat depressed and cold
Learned to play chess my Ni***, Fu** a checker board
Now I call the play,s look around you see the X & O's
When Sh** got foul wasn't no ref to call a technical
Remember
(Chorus: Suli4Q)

Back Then, Back Then
Wasn't coo back then
Wanted me to tap out
Now they want to tap in
Tap in, Tap in
They ain't built like this
Focused on the right now
Past tense, Past Tense

(Outro: Cornell Gorman)

Budha bear, Budha Bear
Trying to make the younger me proud
The me back then is this how you saw me now
Life a do it to you
'Cuz

BACK THEN THE QUESTION WAS
