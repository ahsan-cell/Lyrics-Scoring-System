I know I

[Chorus]
I know I shouldn’t chase money but I run-run-run-run
Shouldn’t chase girls but they fun-fun-fun-fun
Baby you know you’re the only one-one-one-one
Let’s run-run-run-run away
I know I shouldn’t chase money but I run-run-run-run
Shouldn’t chase girls but they fun-fun-fun-fun
Baby you know you’re the only one-one-one-one
Let’s run-run-run-run away

[Verse 1]
Fast car, fast drugs, my American dream
You’d be my plug fill the space in between
Learned all the lies but it ain’t what it seems, no it ain't what it seems to be
So I run around the city ’til my feet hurt
I run around the city ’til I see her

[Chorus]
I know I shouldn’t chase money but I run-run-run-run
Shouldn’t chase girls but they fun-fun-fun-fun
Baby you know you’re the only one-one-one-one
Let’s run-run-run-run away
I know I shouldn’t chase money but I run-run-run-run
Shouldn’t chase girls but they fun-fun-fun-fun
Baby you know you’re the only one-one-one-one
Let’s run-run-run-run away

Señorita, when I meet you
I’ll be looking fresher than a goddamn Beatle
And I ain’t talking no v-dub tryna go one-ten in a two-seater
And you got all of these features
And I really think I need ya
Is you trying to go to the theatre and go see a matinée?
Like, where you stay? Let me know
We can rendez-vous, fo’ sho
Hydro in the air and I don’t fucking care because
I’ve been trying to buy some time
But it costs more than a dime
And that’s what you are though

[Chorus]
I know I shouldn’t chase money but I run-run-run-run
Shouldn’t chase girls but they fun-fun-fun-fun
Baby you know you’re the only one-one-one-one
Let’s run-run-run-run away
I know I shouldn’t chase money but I run-run-run-run
Shouldn’t chase girls but they fun-fun-fun-fun
Baby you know you’re the only one-one-one-one
Let’s run-run-run-run away
