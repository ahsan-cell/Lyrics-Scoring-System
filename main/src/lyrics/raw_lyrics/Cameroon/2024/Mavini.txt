Fresh Boy Chilling
Blame it on my neck

[Verse 1]
Do I ever have to say something
Does it ever have to mean anything
When I call my names
Do I go out saying that I have a new face
Do I meet dud with sale
Do I give a good tale
I keep asking
My heavy well rote soul
I let it go
No I let it go
I don't give a goal
No, no

[Verse 2]
Big in on my verse I carve it
I give you, you have your yaff
Part of it
How I care for every arsenal part of it
Now my love has started having orders
Giving up unmanned
Like it, I get it, I in rave, I rev it
She knows, I never come up
No on blank, it's not on dreg
That zit, I grit it
My fucking big figure
Is all I'm going revving for, neat
This never got me in
Never got me an earn
How you ever feel
Once your body gives you a smile
Voices in my head
They ain't never made me filled

I like your M
I'm West, you see me now
I should never have found
Ticking out everything
It's all in the past
Shrieking in all the quells
Listen, I'm not a fighter
I get it, my talk is here for a kite
Linking at my call
My nest is not your pad
Looking at my ex
I think I did that
I figure it out like a mavin
I could get her to talk
I could give her her parting
Musing out
Easy on the hour
Here's an age
Just o make me feel
Bet on power
I can give her dick
Like here's another mouth
Is that a mild diss
I get the clouts
Cram, make a nick for sound
Easy F
Like do it or do it with twines
Do it hard
Bigger bad
