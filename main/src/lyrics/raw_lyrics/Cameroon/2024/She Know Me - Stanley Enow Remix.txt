I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight, it's only you and me

There ain't no reason you and me should be alone
Tonight, yeah, baby
Tonight, yeah, baby
But I got a reason that you-hoo should take me home

Everybody know you ain't about it

Smokin' Agent Orange, Hi-C
Back when me and Marty was recordin' at my Mom's

I woke up out that coma 2001
'Bout the same time Dre dropped 2001
Three years later the album is done
Aftermath presents: ***** Witta Attitude, Volume One
Rap critics politickin', wanna know the outcome
Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, and Doggystyle in one
I feel like 'Pac after the Snoop Dogg trial was done
Dre behind that G series and All Eyez on Me

We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can't be sold
We were right 'til we weren't
Built a home and watched it burn

It’s me, hi
I’m the problem, it’s me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Welcome to my house
Baby, take control now
We can't even slow down
We don't have to go out

I spent the last two weeks just winning
I spent the last two weeks just spinning
Trying to work you out a skinning
Ever since my heart's been missing

And memories from the past
It's all fading to black
She started turning around
I won't let it control me
I won't let it control me

My hope will never die!

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a ***** get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin Chandon
And I roll the best ****
'cause I got it goin' on

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have, I been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
Look at the times
Sick is the mind of the mother****in' kid that's behind All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans, Explodin' Tempers flaring' from parents, just blow 'em off and keep going' Not taking' nothing' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathing'
Keep kickin' *** in the morning

Welcome to the bassface network

Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
**** you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I didn't invite you
Oh, you important?
You the moral to the story? You endorsing'?
Motha****a, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm building' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest ****

Every time that you get undressed
I hear symphonies in my head
I wrote this song just looking at you oh, oh
Yeah, the drums they swing low
And the trumpets they go

Sexy girl, just flex me, girl
Let me, girl, just test you, girl
No, mi girl, mi nah stress you, girl

I'm walking' alone, the streets are empty
The only thing I can see is my own silhouette
I'm getting' stronger, step by step
The clock is ticking', but there's no time for regrets

I've been flying' from town to town
From London to Taiwan
I've been all around the globe
Trying' to protect your soul

We are heroes tonight
We will fly above the sky

Eyes in the sky, gazing far into the night

If I'm ever moving on
I need you to break me
So I never call you up
'Cause I don't wanna waste more time with you
So every time I lay my eyes on you
I need you to hate me
I need you to hate me

She graduated with a 4.0 (Yeah, yeah)
Only out late if hеr mama knows (Oh-oh)
Got a fast car, but she drive it slow (Slow, slow)
So she don't want mе, she don't want me
She graduated with a 4.0 (Yeah, yeah)
Only out late if her mama knows (Oh-oh)
Got a fast car, but she drive it slow (Slow, slow)
So she don't want me, she don't want me

I throw my hands up, no, this can't be love
Gave all of me but my all ain't enough
Miss what we were, I hate what we've become
Wish I could stay, but there's no saving us

I don't want another pretty face
I don't want just anyone to hold
I don't want my love to go to waste
I want you and your beautiful soul

She's the tear in my heart, I'm alive
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher
Than I've ever been
My heart is my armor
She's the tear in my heart
She's a carver
She's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther
Than I've ever been

Not my chair, not my problem thats what I say

Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of ***
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-*** hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

I get drunk, wake up, I'm wasted still
I realize the time that I wasted here
I feel like you can't feel the way I feel
Oh, I’ll be ****** up if you can't be right here

That if I can't be close to you, I'll settle for the ghost of you
I miss you more than life (More than life)
And if you can't be next to me, your memory is ecstasy
I miss you more than life, I miss you more than life

I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey
I do the same thing I told you that I never would
I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
I need you to stay, need you to

Yo, Skrillex. Drop it hard!

Got all this paper, I don't go to class
Shorty look good with that double-stuffed ***
Shoe made of gator, so I'll see you later
Your boy made the fader, all yo' **** is trash, uh
She only a five in her face
So her head get a bag and my time don't get waste, uh
Give me a time and a place
And I'm pullin' up fast 'cause my tongue like the taste
Ooh, how do you do that?
Keep my **** wavy, like Durags
Make me your ex-man, like Hugh Jack'
I can't be your boo, I'm a ****** bag
Got so much drip, you kids might need a hoodie
Said I'm out here buzzin', but I got a woody
I been in the field, but I feel like a rookie
And I eat that ***** like milk's favorite cookie

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

Shawty's like a melody in my head
That I can't keep out, got me singing like​
Na-na-na-na, every day
It's like my iPod stuck on replay, replay-ay-ay-ay
Shawty's like a melody in my head

Summer has come and passed
The innocent can never last
Wake me up when September ends
Like my father's come to pass
Seven years has gone so fast
Wake me up when September ends

Yeah, I'm 2-45 right down the middle
And I'll miss the green, to the left just a little
Chili dip a wedge, and put it all together
Hit that son of a ***** right up there in the leather
If you call that good, and let me press on the side
You can put me down for a five
If you call that good, and let me press on the side
You can put me down for a five

Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up when September ends
Wake me up
Wake me up
Wake me
Wake me

Hey, Vsauce! Michael, here

Keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, on and on and on
You gotta keep your face up to the sun
We're always on the run, always on the run

I was always the crazy one
I broke into the stadium
And I wrote your number on the 50 yard line
You were always the perfect one
And the valedictorian so
Under your number I wrote "Call for a good time"
And I only wanted to catch your attention
But you overlooked me somehow

I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright
Baby, I'ma have the best ******' night of my life
And wherever it takes me, I'm down for the ride
Baby, don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

Don't you know I'm good, yeah, I'm feelin' alright

I'm blue, da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di, da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di, da ba dee da ba di
Da ba dee da ba di, da ba dee da ba di

I’m blue

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

Just like fire, burnin' up the way
If I could light the world up for just one day
Watch this madness, colorful charade
No one can be just like me any way
Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free
I'mma disappear when they come for me
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?
No one can be just like me anyway
Just like fire, uh

Cuz when our minds collide...
We come alive

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”
We saying: “oh wee, oh wee, oh wee, oh”

You would not believe your eyes if ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
'Cause they'd fill the open air and leave teardrops everywhere
You'd think me rude but I would just stand and stare

I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine (Who can relate? Woo)
I've been on the low, I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

I'd like to make myself believe
That planet Earth turns slowly
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay awake when I'm asleep
'Cause everything is never as it seems (When I fall asleep)

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this **** 'till my bones collapse

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke — gunsmoke! Gunsmoke!
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Mother****er, say your prayers!
"Hail Mary, full of grace..." — smack the ***** in the face
Take her Gucci bag, and the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money? Oh, you got me mistaken, honey

Oh jeez, this place gives me the creeps!
"Hey Granny, I'm here!"
"Just a minute dear!"
"Is there anything to eat?"
Ugh, what smells like pickled feet
? Ugh...
"Do you want to play... hide and seek?"
Uh, no thank you. But is your TV broke?
And why's the front door locked up so much?
Hmm, is that some kind of joke?
Wait... why do you have a bat?
What are you gonna do with that?
Get back! Ow...
I think that something cracked!

The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin on?
You're dead wrong

I miss the old Kanye, straight from the Go Kanye
Chop up the soul Kanye, set on his goals Kanye
I hate the new Kanye, the bad mood Kanye
The always rude Kanye, spaz in the news Kanye
I miss the sweet Kanye, chop up the beats Kanye
I gotta say, at that time I'd like to meet Kanye
See, I invented Kanye, it wasn't any Kanyes
And now I look and look around and there's so many Kanyes
I used to love Kanye, I used to love Kanye
I even had the pink polo, I thought I was Kanye
What if Kanye made a song about Kanye
Called "I Miss The Old Kanye"? Man, that'd be so Kanye
That's all it was Kanye, we still love Kanye
And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye

If you wanna be my lover, you gotta get with my friends
Make it last forever, friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover, you have got to give
Taking is too easy, but that's the way it is
I'll tell you what I want, what I really, really want
So tell me what you want, what you really, really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I really, really, really wanna zigazig ah

*****es callin' my phone like I'm locked up, nonstop
From the plane to the ****in' helicopter, yeah
Cops pullin' up like I'm givin' ***** out, nah, nah
I'm a popstar, not a doctor
Ayy, shawty with the long text, I don't talk, ayy
Shawty with the long legs, she don't walk, ayy
Yeah, last year, I kept it on the tuck, ayy
2020, I came to **** it up, yeah

I want the top
All my people right there in the back of the spot
I need the top
If you know me, you don't know me to stop
I need the top
All my people there in back of the spot
Let off a shot
Yeah

Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes
Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought, “Wow
If I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out”
Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

Poopy-di scoop
Scoop-diddy-whoop
Whoop-di-scoop-di-poop
Poop-di-scoopty
Scoopty-whoop
Whoopity-scoop, whoop-poop
Poop-diddy, whoop-scoop
Poop, poop
Scoop-diddy-whoop
Whoop-diddy-scoop
Whoop-diddy-scoop, poop

If we go down then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better

Aw ****, here we go again

I hear you banging on that battle drum
When we play this song
All my people rise up, we 'bout to set it off
This for the voiceless
And for the hopeless
They say that you could chase your dream
But they take away your choices
So watch out, watch out
You're in the zone now
Watch out, watch out
They takin' notes now
Watch out, they tryna divide us
But all I hear is "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah," hahaha

What is this feelin' takin' over?
Thinkin' no one could open the door
Surprise, it's time
To feel what's real
What happened to Miss Independent?
No longer need to be defensive
Goodbye, old you
When love is true

'Cause she walk like a boss, talk like a boss
Manicured nails to set the pedicure off
She's fly effortlessly
And she move like a boss, do what a boss do
She got me thinking about getting involved
That's the kinda girl I need, oh

Straight outta Compton, it's a crazy brotha named Ice Cube
From the stupid-dope gang wit a attitude
When I'm called off, I gotta sawed-off
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off yo back, that's how I'm going out
For the sucka dumb brothas that's showing out

Oh, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)
No, you don't mean nothing at all to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)
But you got what it takes to set me free (Hey, oh, oh, hey)
Oh, you could mean everything to me (Hey, oh, oh, hey)

We'll never get free, lamb to the slaughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?
The price of your greed is your son and your daughter
What you gon' do when there's blood in the water?

I need ya, I need ya, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losin' my mind now
It's in my head, darlin', I hope
That you'll be here when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down

Oh, Ophelia
You've been on my mind, girl, since the flood
Oh, Ophelia
Heaven help the fool who falls in love

Oh, I'm a gummy bear
Yes, I'm a gummy bear
Oh, I'm a yummy, tummy, funny, lucky gummy bear
I'm a jelly bear
'Cause I'm a gummy bear
Oh, I'm a movin', groovin', jammin', singing gummy bear
Oh, yeah

Love the way you activate your hips and push your *** out
Got a ***** wanting it so bad, I'm about to pass out
Wanna dig you, and I can't even lie about it
Baby just alleviate your clothes, time to fly up out it
Catch you at a club, oh **** you got me feenin
Body talking **** to me but I can't comprehend the meaning
Now, if you wanna roll with me, then here's your chance
Doing' eighty on the freeway, police catch me if you can

‘Cause if it’s fast or slow all I really know
Is I’m gonna enjoy the ride
And if it’s hard or soft before we get off
I’m gonna enjoy the ride
Enjoy the ride

I'm flippin' them patties, I'm chillin' with Patrick
The boat pull up backwards, a day full of laughter
See Sandy Cheeks (Yeah), I'm burstin' her bubble
A jellyfish lover, I'll catch me a couple (Yeah)
A magical world, the F is for fun
I'd run to the sun if only I could
Now turn to your neighbor and make sure they're swell
I probably will be forever be young
I'm feelin' a little bit Krabby, how can I be happy when people are spendin' me money?
The barnacles blue in the morning, I'm skippin' outside
And yeah, I hope that it's sunny
Aye aye, Captain, gettin' the check and I'm gettin' the plunder
Aye aye, Captain, squawk like a dolphin, I'm duckin' the Dutchman (Ayy)

Here's a little song I wrote
You might want to sing it note for note
Don't worry, be happy
In every life we have some trouble
But when you worry you make it double
Don't worry, be happy
Don't worry, be happy now

You don't know me, you don't even care, oh yeah
And you said
You don't know me, and you don't wear my chains... oh yeah

La-da-da-da-dah

So blaze the **** up then, blaze it up, blaze it up!
Just blaze that **** up, ****! Yeah, 'sup, Snoop?

Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second - we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

All I really want, really want for Christmas
Is everything on my list, baby, hey…

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

Quite honest with ya, I ain't really sleep well
Ya ever feel like your train of thought's been derailed?
That's when you press on, Lee Nails
Half the population's just waitin' to see me fail
Yeah right, you're better off tryna freeze hell
Some of us do it for the females
And others do it for the retails
But I do it for the kids, life threw the towel in on
Every time you fall it's only making your chin strong
And I be in your corner like Mick, baby, til the end
Or when you hear this song from that big lady

Up, then it's up, if it's up, then it's stuck (Huh)

You've never heard of me
Or the weird **** I do and say
That's my favorite thing
That I'm not famous, no
And I'm never on TV
Throwing up on an LA street
Nobody judges me
'Cause I'm not famous, no
Where my haters, where my haters?
I don't got 'em, I'm not famous, no
It don't matter what my name is
I don't got one, I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
I'm not famous, no
And I don't hate it, no

Wobble-dy wobble-dy wa wobble wobble
I’m st-stacking my paper my wallet look like a bible
I got girlies half naked that **** look like the grotto
How your waist anorexic and then your *** is colossal
Drop that *** make it boomerang
Take my belt off, ***** I’m Pootie Tang
Tippy tow tippy tay you gon' get a tip today
**** that you gonna get some **** today

There's a place off Ocean Avenue
Where I used to sit and talk with you
We were both sixteen and it felt so right
Sleepin' all day, stayin' up all night
Stayin' up all night

I could stick around and get along with you
Hello, oh-oh-oh
It doesn't really mean that I'm into you
Hello, oh-oh-oh
You're alright, but I'm here, darling, to enjoy the party
Don't get too excited 'cause that's all you'll get from me, hey
Yeah, I think you're cute, but really you should know
I just came to say helloI just came to say hello

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal

I walked in the corner with the body screaming dolo
Never sold a bag but look like Pablo in a photo
This gon' make 'em feel the way like Tony killed Manolo
You already know

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just a baby

You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might, I might
Empty my bank account
And buy that boy with a pipe
Buy that boy with a pipe
I might

You're such a ****in' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a ****in' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a ****in' ho, I love it (I love it)
You're such a ****in' ho, I love it (I love it)

Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the slide
Whatever comes, comes through clear
Do you slide on all your nights like this?
Do you try on all your nights like this? (I might)
Put some spotlight on the side
And whatever comes, comes through clear (Uh)

Ooh, I know you see me standin' here
Do I look good, my dear
Do I look good today (today, today)
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm just another kinda girl
And you wanna see my world
So come and run away
Yeah, yeah

I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good

We flying first class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne
Livin' my life in the fast lane
I won't change by the glamorous
Ooh, the flossy, flossy

Am I wrong for thinkin' out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for sayin' that I choose another way?
I ain't tryin' to do what everybody else doin'
Just 'cause everybody doin' what they all do
If one thing I know, I'll fall, but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home
So, am I wrong?

Vrei să pleci dar nu mă, nu mă iei
Nu mă, nu mă iei, nu mă, nu mă, nu mă iei
Chipul tău și dragostea din tei
Mi-amintesc de ochii tăi

So, am I wrong? (Woo)
For thinkin' that we could be something for real?
Now, am I wrong?
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?

Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me
Hey, boy, I really wanna be with you
'Cause you just my type
Ooh, na, na, na, na
I need a boy to take it over
Lookin' for a guy to put in work
Oh woah, oh woah
Hey, boy, I really wanna see if you
Can go downtown with a girl like me

I threw a wish in the well
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
I looked to you as it fell
And now you're in my way
I trade my soul for a wish
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
I wasn't looking for this
But now you're in my way

Lost and insecure
You found me, you found me
Lyin' on the floor
Surrounded, surrounded
Why'd you have to wait?
Where were you? Where were you?
Just a little late
You found me, you found me

Your stare was holdin'
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
Hot night, wind was blowin'
Where you think you're going, baby?

Middle fingers up, put them hands high
Wave it in his face, tell him, boy, bye (Sorry, I ain't sorry)
Tell him, boy, bye, boy, bye, middle fingers up
I ain't thinking 'bout you

"H-h-h-h-holy shhh..."
Slow down, grab the wall
Wiggle like you trying to make yo ass fall off
Hella thick I wanna smash 'em all
Now speed up
Gas pedal
Gas pedal
Gas pedal
Gas pedal
Gas pedal (You already know me, S-A-G-E)
Now speed up
Gas pedal
Gas pedal

I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Not!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)
I'm hot 'cause I'm fly (Fly!), you ain't 'cause you not (Mims!)
This is why, this is why, this is why I'm hot (Hot!)

Got a booty like Hoopz I'm trying to make-it, woah

'Cause you're the next Drew Barry
And I want more, yeah (More)
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I **** with you for
'Cause you're the next Drew Barry, yeah (Barry)
And I want more
And all these other girls keep wonderin' what I **** with you for, yeah

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere
A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on
Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

3, 2, 1, Drop it!

Fortnite better gimme my kids back
Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my kids back
Fortnite better gimme my kids back
Gimme my, gimme my, gimme my kids back
Uh, I ain't wantin’ to do this, but I had to
Messin' with my life a million is such a bad move
Like the rocket boosters got your boy up in the bad mood
I promise, ya'll that I ain't wantin' to do this, but I had to
Whoo, I ain't wantin' to do this, but I had to
Messin' with my life a million is such a bad move
Like the rocket boosters got your boy up in the bad mood
I promise, ya'll that I ain't wantin' to do this, but I had to

Outro:

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I need your love, I need your time
When everything's wrong, you make it right
I feel so high, I come alive
I need to be free with you tonight
I need your love

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to, but I can't put
Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you

As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby


With a great big hug
And a kiss from me to you
Won't you say you love me too?

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I, I'll do anything I could for ya
Boy you're my only (See it deh girl!)
I, I'm gonna flip these beats on ya
You don’t even know me (Aha!)

When we were young, oh-oh, we did enough
When it got cold, ooh-ooh, we bundled up
I can't be told, ah-ah, it can't be done

A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I
Love you still
And you know I always will

As long as the sea is bound to
Wash up on the sand

You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye


I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby

You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh

And I love you like Kanye loves Kanye


I, I love you like a love song, baby
I, I love you like a love song, baby
