When the sins of my father weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother will not let me go
Well, I know there can't come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of canes
Even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, it's just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain

[Verse 2]
The seed needs the water for it grow out of the ground
It just keeps getting harder, the hunger more profound

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the clouds fill up with thunderous applause
The lightning be the veins
Fill that sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

[Chorus]
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain

The world's full of water
Stops by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
It never reach the port

[Pre-Chorus]
Let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
The lightning be the veins
Fill the sky with all that they can draw
And when it's time to make a change

[Chorus]
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Oh make it rain, make it rain down, oh
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
Make it rain, make it rain
