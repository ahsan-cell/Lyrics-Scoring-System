Dressed up like penguins
Spinning like whirligigs
A big chocolate fountain
Gurgling extravagance
More like three months of rent
And no one's even taken a dip
The guest's are ashamed
They've forgotten the name of the host's lovely wife
But oh, what a sight she is

[Verse 2]
On the veranda
The stanzas just write themselves
Indentured servers
Toking up in the corner
Where no one else lurks
They write me off like some kind of jerk
And maybe I am
I most certainly am
I'm complicit in this
It wouldn't exist without the likes of me

[Chorus]
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?
You might also like[Verse 3]
Jumped in a taxi
A man from Afghanistan
Drives for his family
Sending home every paycheck
He lives with ten men
Taking shifts
Sharing one bed
On Mulholland Drive
He points toward the sky
See the fireworks spill
Over the rooftops of Beverly Hills

[Chorus]
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
What are we doing here?
