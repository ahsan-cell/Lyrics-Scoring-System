Get money
Don't give no fuck what they say about you
Stay down
You know I keep the haters watching
Run it up
I spend that shit, no problem, nigga
Fuck it up
You know it ain't no problem, nigga
Get money (cash)
Get money (money)
Get money (moolah)
Get money (gualla)
Get money (dinero, cash)
Get money (pesos)
Get money
Get money (moolah)

[Verse]
You know that we live or die by it
So much, make them [?] about it
Too much of it will make you rowdy
I'ma get this money, no doubting
Only VS1s, no cloudy
He got the money, but he not 'bout it
Did he shoot a nigga? Yeah, I doubt it
Sipping fours, I get drowsy
I'm smoking cookie, not drowsy
You not 'bout that money, stay from 'round me
We sipping, public service announcement
I'm covered in hundreds who drown me
Bitch rich neck fountain
Get you some money, they down you
Don't keep to them haters on around me
Above them, past the mountains
I know that they watching
I know that they plotting
Can't nobody stop me
But that nigga who watching
I talk to him in private
You know that he got me
He keep providing me
To get this money
You might also like[Chorus]
Get money
Don't give no fuck what they say about you
Stay down
You know I keep the haters watching
Run it up
I spend that shit, no problem, nigga
Fuck it up
You know it ain't no problem, nigga
Get money (cash)
Get money (money)
Get money (moolah)
Get money (gualla)
Get money (dinero, cash)
Get money (pesos)
Get money
Get money (moolah)
