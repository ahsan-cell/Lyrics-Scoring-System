Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hopin' for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not?

[Verse 2]
Let us die young, or let us live forever
We don't have the power, but we never say never
Sittin' in a sandpit, life is a short trip
Music's for the sad men

[Verse 3]
Can you imagine when this race is run?
Turn our golden faces into the sun
Praisin' our leaders, gettin' in tune
The music's played by the madmen

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really want to live forever, forever, forever?

[Verse 4]
Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody, some are the beat
Sooner or later they'll all be gone
Why don't they stay young?
You might also like[Verse 5]
It's hard to get old without a cause
I don't wanna perish like a fadin' horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever, forever, forever?

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever, forever, forever?
Forever young, I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever, forever?6
