Whoa-ah-ah-ah-oh

[Verse 1]
Goin' out on the weekend
Gettin' dressed with my girls
Put on my favourite lip gloss
Cherry Garcia swirl
Perfume, pleasure, and platforms
Livin' that kind of world (Ooh-ooh)
We're gonna live it up tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
So, if you're out with your girls
And if you feel on top of the world
Whoa-ah-ah-ah-oh
Out with your girls
I can't wait to live it up tonight

[Chorus]
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
It's a girls' night out
Let's have a girls' night out tonight
I can't wait to live it up tonight
It's a girls' night out
No boys, no boys
