To rest the weary nurse has gone:
       &nbspAn eight-day watch had watchèd she,
Still rocking beneath sun and moon
       &nbspThe baby on her knee,
Till Isobel its mother said
"The fever waneth—wend to bed,
       &nbspFor now the watch comes round to me."

II.

       &nbspThen wearily the nurse did throw
       &nbsp       &nbspHer pallet in the darkest place
Of that sick room, and slept and dreamed:
       &nbspFor, as the gusty wind did blow
       &nbsp       &nbspThe night-lamp's flare across her face,
She saw or seemed to see, but dreamed,
       &nbspThat the poplars tall on the opposite hill,
The seven tall poplars on the hill,
Did clasp the setting sun until
His rays dropped from him, pined and still
       &nbspAs blossoms in frost,
Till he waned and paled, so weirdly crossed,
To the colour of moonlight which doth pass
Over the dank ridged churchyard grass.
The poplars held the sun, and he
The eyes of the nurse that they should not see
—Not for a moment, the babe on her knee,
Though she shuddered to feel that it grew to be
Too chill, and lay too heavily.
III.

She only dreamed; for all the while
       &nbsp'T was Lady Isobel that kept
       &nbspThe little baby: and it slept
Fast, warm, as if its mother's smile,
Laden with love's dewy weight,
And red as rose of Harpocrate
Dropt upon its eyelids, pressed
Lashes to cheek in a sealèd rest.


IV.

And more and more smiled Isobel
To see the baby sleep so well—
She knew not that she smiled.
Against the lattice, dull and wild
Drive the heavy droning drops,
       &nbspDrop by drop, the sound being one;
As momently time's segments fall
On the ear of God, who hears through all
       &nbspEternity's unbroken monotone:
And more and more smiled Isobel
To see the baby sleep so well—
She knew not that she smiled.
The wind in intermission stops
       &nbspDown in the beechen forest,
       &nbsp       &nbspThen cries aloud
       &nbspAs one at the sorest,
       &nbsp       &nbspSelf-stung, self-driven,
And rises up to its very tops,
Stiffening erect the branches bowed,
       &nbspDilating with a tempest-soul
The trees that with their dark hands break
Through their own outline, and heavy roll
       &nbspShadows as massive as clouds in heaven
       &nbsp       &nbspAcross the castle lake
And more and more smiled Isobel
To see the baby sleep so well;
She knew not that she smiled;
She knew not that the storm was wild;
Through the uproar drear she could not hear
The castle clock which struck anear—
She heard the low, light breathing of her child.
V.

O sight for wondering look!
While the external nature broke
Into such abandonment,
While the very mist, heart-rent
By the lightning, seemed to eddy
Against nature, with a din,—
A sense of silence and of steady
Natural calm appeared to come
From things without, and enter in
The human creature's room.

VI.

So motionless she sate,
       &nbspThe babe asleep upon her knees,
You might have dreamed their souls had gone
Away to things inanimate,
In such to live, in such to moan;
And that their bodies had ta'en back,
       &nbspIn mystic change, all silences
That cross the sky in cloudy rack,
Or dwell beneath the reedy ground
In waters safe from their own sound:
       &nbsp       &nbspOnly she wore
The deepening smile I named before,
And that a deepening love expressed;
And who at once can love and rest?
VII.

In sooth the smile that then was keeping
Watch upon the baby sleeping,
       &nbspFloated with its tender light
Downward, from the drooping eyes,
Upward, from the lips apart,
       &nbspOver cheeks which had grown white
With an eight-day weeping:
All smiles come in such a wise
       &nbspWhere tears shall fall or have of old—
Like northern lights that fill the heart
       &nbspOf heaven in sign of cold.

VIII.

Motionless she sate.
Her hair had fallen by its weight
On each side of her smile and lay
Very blackly on the arm
Where the baby nestled warm,
Pale as baby carved in stone
Seen by glimpses of the moon
Up a dark cathedral aisle:
But, through the storm, no moonbeam fell
       &nbspUpon the child of Isobel—
Perhaps you saw it by the ray
       &nbspAlone of her still smile.

IX.

       &nbspA solemn thing it is to me
       &nbsp       &nbspTo look upon a babe that sleeps
       &nbsp       &nbspWearing in its spirit-deeps
       &nbspThe undeveloped mystery
       &nbsp       &nbspOf our Adam's taint and woe,
       &nbspWhich, when they developed be,
       &nbsp       &nbspWill not let it slumber so;
       &nbspLying new in life beneath
       &nbspThe shadow of the coming death,
       &nbspWith that soft, low, quiet breath,
       &nbsp       &nbspAs if it felt the sun;
       &nbspKnowing all things by their blooms,
       &nbspNot their roots, yea, sun and sky
       &nbspOnly by the warmth that comes
       &nbspOut of each, earth only by
       &nbsp       &nbspThe pleasant hues that o'er it run,
       &nbspAnd human love by drops of sweet
       &nbsp       &nbspWhite nourishment still hanging round
       &nbsp       &nbspThe little mouth so slumber-bound:
       &nbspAll which broken sentiency
       &nbspAnd conclusion incomplete,
       &nbsp       &nbspWill gather and unite and climb
       &nbspTo an immortality
       &nbsp       &nbspGood or evil, each sublime,
       &nbspThrough life and death to life again.
       &nbsp       &nbspO little lids, now folded fast,
       &nbsp       &nbspMust ye learn to drop at last
       &nbspOur large and burning tears?
       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspO warm quick body, must thou lie,
       &nbspWhen the time comes round to die,
       &nbsp       &nbspStill from all the whirl of years,
       &nbspBare of all the joy and pain?
       &nbspO small frail being, wilt thou stand
       &nbspAt God's right hand,
       &nbspLifting up those sleeping eyes
       &nbspDilated by great destinies,
To an endless waking? thrones and seraphim.
Through the long ranks of their solemnities,
Sunning thee with calm looks of Heaven's surprise,
       &nbspBut thine alone on Him?
Or else, self-willed, to tread the Godless place,
(God keep thy will!) feel thine own energies
Cold, strong, objèctless, like a dead man's clasp,
The sleepless deathless life within thee grasp,—
While myriad faces, like one changeless face,
With woe not love's, shall glass thee everywhere
And overcome thee with thine own despair?

X.

More soft, less solemn images
Drifted o'er the lady's heart
       &nbspSilently as snow.
She had seen eight days depart
Hour by hour, on bended knees,
       &nbspWith pale-wrung hands and prayings low
And broken, through which came the sound
Of tears that fell against the ground,
Making sad stops.—"Dear Lord, dear Lord!"
She still had prayed, (the heavenly word
Broken by an earthly sigh)
—"Thou who didst not erst deny
The mother-joy to Mary mild,
Blessèd in the blessèd child
Which hearkened in meek babyhood
Her cradle-hymn, albeit used
To all that music interfused
In breasts of angels high and good!
Oh, take not, Lord, my babe away—
Oh, take not to thy songful heaven
The pretty baby thou hast given,
Or ere that I have seen him play
Around his father's knees and known
That he knew how my love has gone
From all the world to him.
Think, God among the cherubim,
How I shall shiver every day
In thy June sunshine, knowing where
The grave-grass keeps it from his fair
Still cheeks: and feel, at every tread,
His little body, which is dead
And hidden in thy turfy fold,
Doth make thy whole warm earth a-cold!
O God, I am so young, so young—
       &nbspI am not used to tears at nights
Instead of slumber—not to prayer
With sobbing lips and hands out-wrung!
Thou knowest all my prayings were
       &nbsp'I bless thee, God, for past delights—
Thank God!' I am not used to bear
Hard thoughts of death; the earth doth cover
No face from me of friend or lover:
And must the first who teaches me
The form of shrouds and funerals, be
Mine own first-born belovèd? he
Who taught me first this mother-love?
Dear Lord who spreadest out above
Thy loving, transpierced hands to meet
All lifted hearts with blessing sweet,—
Pierce not my heart, my tender heart
Thou madest tender! Thou who art
So happy in thy heaven alway,
Take not mine only bliss away!"

XI.

She so had prayed: and God, who hears
Through seraph-songs the sound of tears
From that belovèd babe had ta'en
The fever and the beating pain.
And more and more smiled Isobel
To see the baby sleep so well,
       &nbsp(She knew not that she smiled, I wis)
Until the pleasant gradual thought
Which near her heart the smile enwrought,
Now soft and slow, itself did seem
To float along a happy dream,
       &nbspBeyond it into speech like this.

XII.

"I prayed for thee, my little child,
       &nbspAnd God has heard my prayer!
And when thy babyhood is gone,
We two together undefiled
By men's repinings, will kneel down
       &nbspUpon His earth which will be fair
(Not covering thee, sweet!) to us twain,
       &nbspAnd give Him thankful praise."

XIII.

Dully and wildly drives the rain:
Against the lattices drives the rain.

XIV.

"I thank Him now, that I can think
       &nbspOf those same future days,
Nor from the harmless image shrink
       &nbspOf what I there might see—
Strange babies on their mothers' knee,
Whose innocent soft faces might
From off mine eyelids strike the light,
       &nbspWith looks not meant for me!"

XV.

Gustily blows the wind through the rain,
As against the lattices drives the rain.

XVI.

"But now, O baby mine, together,
       &nbspWe turn this hope of ours again
To many an hour of summer weather,
When we shall sit and intertwine
       &nbspOur spirits, and instruct each other
       &nbspIn the pure loves of child and mother!
Two human loves make one divine."

XVII.

The thunder tears through the wind and the rain,
As full on the lattices drives the rain.

XVIII.

"My little child, what wilt thou choose?
       &nbspNow let me look at thee and ponder.
What gladness, from the gladnesses
       &nbspFuturity is spreading under
Thy gladsome sight? Beneath the trees
Wilt thou lean all day, and lose
Thy spirit with the river seen
Intermittently between
       &nbspThe winding beechen alleys,—
Half in labour, half repose,
       &nbspLike a shepherd keeping sheep,
       &nbspThou, with only thoughts to keep
Which never a bound will overpass,
And which are innocent as those
       &nbspThat feed among Arcadian valleys
       &nbsp       &nbspUpon the dewy grass?"

XIX.

The large white owl that with age is blind,
       &nbspThat hath sate for years in the old tree hollow,
Is carried away in a gust of wind;
His wings could beat him not as fast
As he goeth now the lattice past;
       &nbspHe is borne by the winds, the rains do follow
His white wings to the blast outflowing,
       &nbsp       &nbspHe hooteth in going,
And still, in the lightnings, coldly glitter
       &nbsp       &nbspHis round unblinking eyes

XX.

"Or, baby, wilt thou think it fitter
       &nbspTo be eloquent and wise,
One upon whose lips the air
       &nbspTurns to solemn verities
For men to breathe anew, and win
A deeper-seated life within?
Wilt be a philosopher,
       &nbspBy whose voice the earth and skies
Shall speak to the unborn?
Or a poet, broadly spreading
       &nbspThe golden immortalities
Of thy soul on natures lorn
       &nbspAnd poor of such, them all to guard
From their decay,—beneath thy treading,
Earth's flowers recovering hues of Eden,—
And stars, drawn downward by thy looks,
To shine ascendant in thy books?"

XXI.

       &nbspThe tame hawk in the castle-yard,
How it screams to the lightning, with its wet
Jagged plumes overhanging the parapet!
And at the lady's door the hound
Scratches with a crying sound.

XXII.

"But, O my babe, thy lids are laid
       &nbspClose, fast upon thy cheek,
And not a dream of power and sheen
Can make a passage up between;
Thy heart is of thy mother's made,
       &nbspThy looks are very meek,
And it will be their chosen place
To rest on some beloved face,
       &nbspAs these on thine, and let the noise
Of the whole world go on nor drown
       &nbspThe tender silence of thy joys:
Or when that silence shall have grown
       &nbspToo tender for itself, the same
Yearning for sound,—to look above
And utter its one meaning, LOVE,
       &nbspThat He may hear His name."

XXIII.

No wind, no rain, no thunder!
The waters had trickled not slowly,
The thunder was not spent
Nor the wind near finishing;
Who would have said that the storm was diminishing?
No wind, no rain, no thunder!
Their noises dropped asunder
From the earth and the firmament,
From the towers and the lattices,
Abrupt and echoless
As ripe fruits on the ground unshaken wholly
       &nbspAs life in death.
And sudden and solemn the silence fell,
Startling the heart of Isobel
       &nbspAs the tempest could not:
Against the door went panting the breath
Of the lady's hound whose cry was still,
       &nbspAnd she, constrained howe'er she would not,
Lifted her eyes and saw the moon
Looking out of heaven alone
       &nbspUpon the poplared hill,—
       &nbspA calm of God, made visible
       &nbspThat men might bless it at their will.

XXIV.

The moonshine on the baby's face
       &nbspFalleth clear and cold:
The mother's looks have fallen back
       &nbspTo the same place:
Because no moon with silver rack,
Nor broad sunrise in jasper skies
       &nbspHas power to hold
       &nbspOur loving eyes,
Which still revert, as ever must
Wonder and Hope, to gaze on the dust.

XXV.


The moonshine on the baby's face
       &nbspCold and clear remaineth;
The mother's looks do shrink away,—
The mother's looks return to stay,
       &nbspAs charmèd by what paineth:
Is any glamour in the case?
       &nbspIs it dream, or is it sight?
Hath the change upon the wild
       &nbspElements that sign the night,
Passed upon the child?
       &nbspIt is not dream, but sight.


XXVI.

The babe has awakened from sleep
       &nbspAnd unto the gaze of its mother,
       &nbspBent over it, lifted another—
       &nbspNot the baby-looks that go
       &nbspUnaimingly to and fro,
But an earnest gazing deep
Such as soul gives soul at length
       &nbspWhen by work and wail of years
It winneth a solemn strength
       &nbspAnd mourneth as it wears.
A strong man could not brook,
       &nbspWith pulse unhurried by fears,
To meet that baby's look
       &nbspO'erglazed by manhood's tears,
The tears of a man full grown,
With a power to wring our own,
In the eyes all undefiled
Of a little three-months' child—
To see that babe-brow wrought
By the witnessing of thought
       &nbspTo judgment's prodigy,
And the small soft mouth unweaned,
By mother's kiss o'erleaned,
(Putting the sound of loving
Where no sound else was moving
       &nbspExcept the speechless cry)
Quickened to mind's expression,
Shaped to articulation,
Yea, uttering words, yea, naming woe,
       &nbspIn tones that with it strangely went
       &nbspBecause so baby-innocent,
As the child spake out to the mother, so:—


XXVII.

"O mother, mother, loose thy prayer!
       &nbspChrist's name hath made it strong.
It bindeth me, it holdeth me
With its most loving cruelty,
       &nbspFrom floating my new soul along
       &nbspThe happy heavenly air.
It bindeth me, it holdeth me
       &nbspIn all this dark, upon this dull
Low earth, by only weepers trod.
It bindeth me, it holdeth me!
       &nbspMine angel looketh sorrowful
Upon the face of God.

XXVIII.

"Mother, mother, can I dream
       &nbspBeneath your earthly trees?
I had a vision and a gleam,
       &nbspI heard a sound more sweet than these
When rippled by the wind:
       &nbspDid you see the Dove with wings
       &nbspBathed in golden glisterings
From a sunless light behind,
       &nbspDropping on me from the sky,
Soft as mother's kiss, until
I seemed to leap and yet was still?
       &nbspSaw you how His love-large eye
Looked upon me mystic calms,
       &nbspTill the power of His divine
       &nbspVision was indrawn to mine?

XXIX.

"Oh, the dream within the dream!
       &nbspI saw celestial places even.
Oh, the vistas of high palms
       &nbspMaking finites of delight
       &nbspThrough the heavenly infinite,
Lifting up their green still tops
       &nbspTo the heaven of heaven!
Oh, the sweet life-tree that drops
Shade like light across the river
Glorified in its for-ever
       &nbspFlowing from the Throne!
Oh, the shining holinesses
Of the thousand, thousand faces
       &nbspGod-sunned by the thronèd One,
And made intense with such a love
That, though I saw them turned above,
Each loving seemed for also me!
And, oh, the Unspeakable, the He,
The manifest in secrecies
       &nbspYet of mine own heart partaker
With the overcoming look
Of One who hath been once forsook
       &nbspAnd blesseth the forsaker!
Mother, mother, let me go
Toward the Face that looketh so!
       &nbspThrough the mystic wingèd Four
Whose are inward, outward eyes
Dark with light of mysteries
       &nbspAnd the restless evermore
'Holy, holy, holy,'—through
The sevenfold Lamps that burn in view
       &nbspOf cherubim and seraphim,—
Through the four-and-twenty crowned
Stately elders white around,
       &nbspSuffer me to go to Him!

XXX.

"Is your wisdom very wise,
       &nbspMother, on the narrow earth,
       &nbspVery happy, very worth
That I should stay to learn?
Are these air-corrupting sighs
       &nbspFashioned by unlearnèd breath?
Do the students' lamps that burn
       &nbspAll night, illumine death?
Mother, albeit this be so,
Loose thy prayer and let me go
Where that bright chief angel stands
Apart from all his brother bands,
Too glad for smiling, having bent
In angelic wilderment
O'er the depths of God, and brought
Reeling thence one only thought
To fill his own eternity.
He the teacher is for me—
He can teach what I would know—
Mother, mother, let me go!


XXXI.

"Can your poet make an Eden
       &nbspNo winter will undo,
And light a starry fire while heeding
       &nbspHis hearth's is burning too?
Drown in music the earth's din,
And keep his own wild soul within
       &nbspThe law of his own harmony?
Mother, albeit this be so,
Let me to my heaven go!
       &nbspA little harp me waits thereby,
A harp whose strings are golden all
And tuned to music spherical,
Hanging on the green life-tree
Where no willows ever be.
Shall I miss that harp of mine?
Mother, no!—the Eye divine
Turned upon it, makes it shine;
And when I touch it, poems sweet
Like separate souls shall fly from it,
Each to the immortal fytte.
We shall all be poets there,
Gazing on the chiefest Fair.


XXXII.

"Love! earth's love! and can we love
Fixedly where all things move?
Can the sinning love each other?
       &nbspMother, mother,
I tremble in thy close embrace,
I feel thy tears adown my face,
       &nbspThy prayers do keep me out of bliss—
O dreary earthly love!
Loose thy prayer and let me go
       &nbspTo the place which loving is
Yet not sad; and when is given
Escape to thee from this below,
Thou shalt behold me that I wait
For thee beside the happy Gate,
And silence shall be up in heaven
       &nbspTo hear our greeting kiss."


XXXIII.

       &nbspThe nurse awakes in the morning sun,
       &nbsp       &nbspAnd starts to see beside her bed
       &nbsp       &nbspThe lady with a grandeur spread
       &nbspLike pathos o'er her face, as one
       &nbspGod-satisfied and earth-undone;
       &nbsp       &nbspThe babe upon her arm was dead:
And the nurse could utter forth no cry,—
She was awed by the calm in the mother's eye.


XXXIV.

"Wake, nurse!" the lady said;
       &nbsp"We are waking—he and I—
       &nbspI, on earth, and he, in sky:
And thou must help me to o'erlay
With garment white this little clay
       &nbspWhich needs no more our lullaby.


XXXV.

"I changed the cruel prayer I made,
And bowed my meekened face, and prayed
That God would do His will; and thus
He did it, nurse! He parted us:
And His sun shows victorious
The dead calm face,—and I am calm,
And Heaven is hearkening a new psalm.

XXXVI.

"This earthly noise is too anear,
Too loud, and will not let me hear
The little harp. My death will soon
Make silence."

       &nbsp       &nbspAnd a sense of tune,
A satisfied love meanwhile
Which nothing earthly could despoil,
Sang on within her soul.


XXXVII.

       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbsp       &nbspOh you,
Earth's tender and impassioned few,
Take courage to entrust your love
To Him so named who guards above
       &nbspIts ends and shall fulfil!
Breaking the narrow prayers that may
Befit your narrow hearts, away
       &nbspIn His broad, loving will.
