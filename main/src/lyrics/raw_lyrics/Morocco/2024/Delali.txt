All of these women tonight
They just came for the turn up
Got my drink in my hand
And my blunt I'm about to burn it, yeah

[Bridge: GASHI]
All of these women tonight

[Verse 1: GASHI]
Bad bitch in a coupe
Showing me the things that I never knew
Got me doing things that I never do (ah)
Cut off every bitch that went out for you
Push up on the gas now we on the move
Dodgin' all these haters hit 'em with the deuce
Always see me winning I can never lose
Call up all my women about rendez-vous

[Pre-Chorus: GASHI]
You want it, pushing upon it
Stuck in a moment, this what I'm wantin'
Wait in a minute, think in a minute
Now that we're in it, baby we're winning
