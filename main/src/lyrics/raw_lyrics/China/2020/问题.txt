这么一算也有十年了
Here we go (Yeah)
好吧，一起来！

[Verse 1]
Visualizin' and realizin' my life is fuckin' crazy
想象过才意识到我的生活如此疯狂
Poppin' like JAY-Z, Dirty Dancin' on the game like Swayze
炫酷得像JAY-Z，在这场说唱游戏里我就是和Swayze一样的花花公子
I'm one of the illest and bitch
我就是最不被看好的那个
I've been ready to kill it, it's so amazing
不过我已经准备好，呵
Bitch, I've been blazin', I'm talkin' grass, I ain't talkin' grazing
傻x，老子也曾站在顶峰、说着最牛的词，这可不是玩笑
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch
当我喝着洋酒，音乐随之响起
Let the haters kick rocks, my shit is tip-top
让他们嫉妒去吧
I never flip-flop, why? 'Cause my soul too strong
我从未失败，为何？都归功于我坚强的灵魂
Did this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long
尽管努力了很久，但你要知道这是我一人白手起家
The flow sophisticated
我的flow如此复杂
All these youngins do is whine like they inebriated
其他菜鸟唱我的歌估计连句都成不了
I'm hated, but yeah, that's how you know I made it
老子是被讨厌，但也正是这点让你明白我的强大
I'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this
我就是最屌的人之一，最真实的人之一，现在我蓄势待发
The people, they feel us, me and my team made millions
人群感受到了我的旋律
But you know we still us
即使赚百万美元我的初心仍不变
That's why they wanna kill us, that's why they wanna kill us
这就是为什么其他人如此嫉妒我、抱怨不停
RattPack, real all the time, we never phony
我永远都是最真实的存在，从来不搞欺骗
I'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony
我和索尼公司一样一人掌握大局、运筹帷幄
While the rest of these rappers is acting
而其他的说唱歌手都是虚假的演员
Pass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar
让他们得奖吧，颁几座奥斯卡
From the new school rappers, yeah I'm the illest on the roster
在这新派说唱中，我就站在顶峰！
Smoke like a rasta
老子吸大麻时和信徒一般虔诚
Black and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley
将会和Bob Marley 一样永垂不朽，是的，和他一样
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line
（我知道）这些种族歧视的傻x讨厌我说的上一句话
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain
不过这些网络上的喷子也因为我而哑口无言
Said I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the Garden
嘴上说着我一事无成，而老子刚把所有的一切都卖了出去

这就是为什么我们喝着英酿威士忌
Like Sinatra, screamin', "Motherfuck the cops"
像Sinatra一样嘴里大喊警察都是混蛋

[Verse 2]
They say they want the old Logic, the one that flow like a faucet
他们要我找回原来的模样，就那个说话像水龙头一样的
I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they agnostic
不过老子根本没变，他们就是不信非说我换了风格
If I spit over the boom-bap, then they perceive it as nostalgic
无知的人们看见我唱着硬核说唱，非觉得我是在追寻无谓的理想
But the truth is, my subject matter has been the same
不过事实是我从未改变
And my production selection is still flame
并且我的音乐永远最火
But they love you on the come up 'cause you ain't tainted by fame
可惜他们只会爱上那个没出名
And you still they little secret
保留着小秘密的我
That's the type of bullshit that they frequent

假装不是自己，驱散营苟之辈
Who you know worth 50 million, still rappin on break beats?

Thank you for the love and inspiration plenty

现在我得换下主题了，来揭开谜底
I was born in mint condition, I'm everybody's life's mission
我出生时一穷二白，而现在却受万众瞩目
