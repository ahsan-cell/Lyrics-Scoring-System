Waiting for your call

Just reflecting on it
Tell me why you won't believe it

Shit is fucking rough

You can see it from a distance
Yea I just keep on reminiscing

Oh he got no rights to be
I'm bouta flip the scenes
You best be running away running away

Ah he got no rights to be
I'm bouta change the scenes
You best be running away running away

Oh you let me live a lie
Just look inside
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like

Oh you let me live a lie

落地灯 百叶帘
Baby你的香味坐落南山边
睡莲 飘过来水中间
卷珠 散落到我的心里面
枫叶红 竹青绿
怎让我得不偿失让我不得已
人不归来可 看风已去
不醉不归不见不如意
Oh you let me live a lie
Just look inside
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like

Oh you let me live a lie
Just look inside
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like
