While you’re dreaming on the futon
And I’m playing Pokemon
We’re still not done
It is fun, until I’m gone
Cause it don’t last long, it won’t last long

We in a world that I could kill dragons
We on a mission that I’m not allowed to be passive
Too much talent on the team we can’t stay silent
You wanna question the kings, ay, that’s forbidden

I got my wand
Finna get some (kill dat pussy)
A hazard to the creatures Imma do it for fun
Flexing on my helmet and and the sword that I won
Pull up to the dungeon with a lotta ice in my trunk
Imma do it

Imma pick up one of these
Chop it into pieces
Peeling off thе scales
Clearing out the gut fеces
Tail stewed into stock
Slice and grill the brisket
Liver makes a good sauce
Dip it with the balls (in it)
You might also likeWings deep fried with lemon on side
Ribs with wine, girl, such a delight
Who keeps eyes? We can roll the dice
Imma treat you right like a bride tonight

Got a lotta preparation to impress your stomach
Gotta try out all the recipes and show you what is coming
Would you please lemme treat you right
Would you please lemme treat you…

Tonight I wanna show you what is love
Some ordinary shit’s just not enough
I could show you
Show you all the magic tricks and satisfy your lust
Tonight, I just wanna fuck

Appetite growing with the fame
I’ve been switchin’ up the flavors for a change
Told her meet me at the usual location
She tasty, Imma eat some and save the rest for later

Trapped like a rat in the maze
I got my feelings locked and put away in a cage
She a beast, took a minute just to tame it
A body like that, she def a little crazy
Sip on the blood of that dragon I slayed
Roast it up, Targaryen flame
Seasoned up with my favorite sauce
Sauce it up, just to satisfy my cravings

I made a mess from the juice that you making
Still drink it on a daily basis, I’m hydrated
Face bloated in the morning, Cathy don’t blame me
Dat pussy too good, you know what Im…

Tonight I wanna show you what is love
Some ordinary shit’s just not enough
I could show you
Show you all the magic tricks and satisfy your lust
Tonight, I just wanna fuck
Tonight

Hey, this might be a bit cliché
But after you I’m not the same
The thought of you can drive me insane
Ok, is there poison in my vein?
Or am I cursed to be your slave?
And only you can ease my pain

Hey, this might be a bit cliché
But after you I’m not the same
The thought of you can make my day
Ok, even though you’re miles away
Nothing’s getting in our way
Tonight we’re gonna misbehave
Hey, this might be a bit cliché
But after you I’m not the same
The thought of you can make my day
Ok, is there poison in my vein?
Or am I cursed to be your slave?
And only you can ease my pain

Tonight I just wanna
