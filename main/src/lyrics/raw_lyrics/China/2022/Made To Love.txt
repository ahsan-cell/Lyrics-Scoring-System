相信自己的直觉 从未曾改变
最初的那张脸
经历多少次更迭
太多无法预言
安静跨越
迎接未来不管多远
用特写放大着每一天
每一刻都要燃烧沸点

[Chorus]
That we've got one life, one world
So let's come together
We'll weather the storm
A rain of colors
Look up to the sky
We're all made of shooting stars
We are made to love, woah

[Post-Chorus]
We are made to love, woah
We are made to love, woah
We are made to love
We are made to love

[Verse 2]
散落着的彩笔 空白的画面
依旧在那边
Then I would
Oh, yes, I would, yeah
用笔描绘现实与回忆的关联
Then I would
Trust me, I would

有过超越极限的瞬间
经历过自己的改变
走过的痕迹变成光电
生命 渺小不可思议
生活 绝不轻易放弃

[Chorus]
That wе've got one life, onе world
So let's come together
We'll weather the storm
A rain of colors
Look up to the sky
We're all made of shooting stars
We are made to love, woah

[Post-Chorus]
We are made to love, woah
We are made to love (Love), woah
We are made to love
We are made to love

[Chorus]
'Cause we've got one life, one world
So let's come together
We'll weather the storm
A rain of colors
Look up to the sky
We're all made of shooting stars
We are made to love, woah
[Post-Chorus]
We are made to love, woah
We are made to love, woah
We are made to love
We are made to love
