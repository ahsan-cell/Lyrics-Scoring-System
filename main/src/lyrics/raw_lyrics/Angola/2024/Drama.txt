Whole lotta gang shit poppin
Bad bitch soft like cotton got me going hard all day ain't stoppin
Spent eight racks on drip niggas doing that discount shit ain’t shoppin
Niggas ain't writin no scripts but I load my clip just in case they plottin
I got three stripe all on my feet but I need my check as soon as I walk in
Late night I ain't gon sleep gotta put my work in fo’ they clock in
Last time niggas had beef hadda up my heat fo' we got shit poppin
Nine times in the last week had to tell my last bitch quit that stalkin

And I really ain't with that drama
Dolce and Gabana
Slim dominicana I just met in Caribana
Shawty want marijuana and she got some friends from Ghana
Linked up with her whole clique and the gyal look real hot just like sauna
And they really ain't with that rara
They just wanna smoke that lala
Take a few shots of the José too, made them hoes do tricks like tada
G strings all in my hotel room say Gucci, Fendi, Prada
Niggas wan' ride my wave and I sit back and laugh like haha

[Chorus: Mozardell]
Laughing to the bank
Limo smell like dank I'm in Europe contain Francs
I just spilled some drink on my brand new cuban link
But my diamonds came from Africa so they already pink
And I got some rank, shawty tell me what you need
She know I'm a dog, bitches on me like some fleas
Ice all on my neck they should call me Mr.Freeze
Foreigns overseas let me touch her ovaries

Nine times in the last week had to tell my last bitch quit that stalkin

And my diamond they hit like bling bling blow
Diamond they bling bling bling
Shawty wan feel this ting right now hit me like ring ring ring
Heard he got hit with a bid off loud, prolly gon sing sing sing
Forty round clip to his chin like bow, they ain't get not one thing
Doing donuts in the Rolls Royce truck and the guts on KrispyKreme
Soon as I get done counting this green, ima get in between
I ain't gon hold my nut Irene, Plan B fifty beans
She say fuck you mean, boy you been knew my routine

[Chorus: Mozardell]
Laughing to the bank
Limo smell like dank I’m in Europe contain Francs
