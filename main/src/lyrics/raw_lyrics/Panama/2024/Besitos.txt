Do you all remember Barbara
And her renowned rhubarb bar?
Yeah, in Barbara's rhubarb bar
Back then, the rhubarb never became scarce
'Cause in Barbara's rhubarb bar, they had, as you know
A rhubarb pie that you won't forget in a hurry
It has been very popular with three barbarians for years
'Cause barbarians know what a good rhubarb is
Barbarians know what a good rhubarb is
Kn-, kn-, know what a good rhubarb is
Th-, th-, then there was also the Barbarian Beard Barber
With him, the barbarians spent almost every evening here
And drank with him after work their
Rhubarb Barbara Bar barbarian beard barber beer
And since the beard barbеr was really here еvery night
Soon, Barbara needed for the Rhubarb Bar Beer Bar
Additional staff
So that she didn't have to do it all alone behind the counter
And so the next day, Bärbel was suddenly standing at the counter
She was smart, charming and very well-read
Instantly, it was all over for everyone in the rhubarb bar
As soon as they had seen this beautiful creature standing behind the counter
The beard barber shouted: "Bärbel
You're the woman I'm selling all my possessions for
I wish you were my Rhubarb Barbara Bar
Barbarian beard barber beer bar Bärbel"
The three barbarians were also busy wooing
They would die for a smile from Bärbel
But all their wooing was ignored by Bärbel
'Cause Bärbel was mainly interested in Barbara
And there was clear sympathy on both sides
Obviously, besides Bärbel, Barbara was also bi
A rainbow appeared in the brightest colors
When Barbara and Bärbel said "I do" to each other
The party then took place in the Rhubarb Bar (Of course!)
And was to be second to none
The beard barber was there, the barbarians were there
And of course, there was plenty of rhubarb pie
The three barbarians served
A rhubarb Barbara barbarians barbecue
And later on, to dance, there sang the not at all bland
Baden-Baden rhubarb bar balladeers
So they both said "I do" to each other
Rhubarb Barbara and her Bärbel—hurray!
And soon, the stork Master Adebar came quickly
And brought a child to the Rhubarb Bar
Apart from Bärbel and Barbara
Of course, the beard barber and the barbarians were also there for the baby
They were all like a giant family
And they named the child Emily (Beautiful!)
Will it later take over the barbershop
Or stand behind the counter at Barbara's?
Maybe!
