Eddie Flagrante reporting for Expos√© Magazine! Shocking news this week, America -- small-town rebellious teen, Jonny Warner, committed suicide early the morning of the fourteenth by hurling himself headlong into the main waste treatment silo of the Francis Gary Powers Nuclear Plant. Jonny, who spelled his name without the customary "H," was said to have taken his life in the name of teen love. A tragic case of a hormonal imbalance resulting in a Class Three nuclear disaster!

[CANDY, spoken]
Hey, Toffee. Why the grumpy face?

[TOFFEE, spoken]
Oh, no reason...

[COCO, spoken]
You didn't seem yourself today at pep squad

[GINGER, spoken]
And you dropped your baton three times at twirling practice!

[TOFFEE, spoken]
Sorry, girls, I guess I just have my mind on... other things

[GIRLS, spoken]
Tell us about it, Toffee!

[TOFFEE]
Three weeks ago I told him we were through
I did what my parents said to do
They said "enough,"
Said he was "no good"
He wasn't bad
He was just misunderstood
Three weeks ago
We said our good-byes
I saw there were tears in his eyes

But he shook his head
(Aah)
And he drove into the night...

[TOFFEE]
And buried his body deep at sea

[GIRLS]
Down, down below

[TOFFEE & GIRLS]
As he sailed off
(Ooh)
I knew my dreams were through
(Ooh)
The sun, it set
(Aah)
Upon my ocean blue...
