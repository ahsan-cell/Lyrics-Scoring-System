We're living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good
We got everything we need in our neighborhood
No fancy cars

[Verse 1]
Remember when we were fifteen
Smoking in the park
Never really noticed you
But I was falling hard
Remember Jimmy's pick-up
From driving in the dark
If I think about it now
We didn't think at all
Oh

[Chorus]
We're living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good
We got everything we need in our neighborhood
No fancy cars
Everything's gon' be good
I don't wanna know where it's gonna go, it's crazy living this life
Oh oh
Living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good

Remember getting busted
Graffiti on the wall
You left me rebelliously
With the hands tied up and all
I wonder what you've been up to
Jimmy's still the same
The old tree in our backyard's still scarred by our names

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm hanging on to everyone I know that we did at the time
I don't wanna know if it's gonna go, it's crazy living this life
Oh oh

[Chorus]
We're living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good
We got everything we need in our neighborhood
No fancy cars
Everything's gon' be good
I don't wanna know where it's gonna go, it's crazy living this life
Oh oh
Living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good
[Bridge]
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good

[Chorus]
We're living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good
We got everything we need in our neighborhood
No fancy cars
Everything's gon' be good
I don't wanna know where it's gonna go, it's crazy living this life
Oh oh

[Outro]
Living in our own little Hollywood
We're washed up stars
Everything's gon' be good1
