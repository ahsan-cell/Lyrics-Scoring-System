What would Iron duke do?
Ride around the city in a new coupe
All blorck, amBhakajuju
Batman, pull up in a master Bruce suit
Hard cash, that's the only thing I’m used to
God’s hand feeding me the sghubu, Amen!
You know you know the story well well
They call me crazy, yah vele

[Post-Chorus: AKA]
We ain't trippin' when the party close
If you ain't with it then it's adios
Am I Supa Mega a Super Mario?
Are you a pretender, are you a solid oke?

[Verse 1: AKA]
I'm the plug, all my shit go number one
Too many hits, sucker punch, upper cut
I'm in the mix, double cut, bubble butt
I'm the shit, Motorsport BM dub
Galácticos cav' us with a telescope
Real shit, two hundreds in an envelope
In the states, they think I'm from Mexico
In Western Cape, I'm swimming in these yellow bones
Yellow tape, I see dead rappers
Gucci bandanas, MC Hammers
Kiss the ring, escape the planet
(Get the fuck out of here, oh)
How you gon' live this life alone?
Without you I ain't shit and that's all I know
I'm a survivor, I'm not gon' give up
Kilimanjaro, Kap show my spirit
Touch down in Lagos, got jungle fever
I think I need, sexual healing
You might also like[Chorus: AKA]
What would Iron duke do?
Ride around the city in a new coupe
All black, amBhakajuju
Batman, pull up in a master Bruce suit
Hard cash, that's the only thing I’m used to
God’s hand feeding me the sghubu, Amen!
You know you know the story well well
They call me crazy, yah vele

[Verse 2: AKA]
Money machine yeah
Top of the pyramid scheme yeah
This my dream yeah
R.I.P Linda Mkhize
I don't mean no disrespect, but in my humble opinion
Supa Mega, musical-musical genius
I am the reason, all of y'all rapping in English
Tumi is king yeah (But y'all ain't bought none of his CDs)
Take her to the hood and buy her a kota
Take her to the mall, that's Richard Maponya
Take her to the north and feed her Mimosa
Wake up in my bed, you feel like a pornstar
I aim for your head, you feel like it's conjure
This dick in your chest, you feel it makoya
Pussy magic, pussy tragic, huh
[Verse 3: L-Tido]
Straight from Alex, snakes and ladders
Well established, raise my status
Mind your manners, find your balance
Who want the smoke?
Who want the fame?
Who want the cameras?

Loots and the broads, I shoot for the stars
Body tatted cause we can't remove all the scars
So we drink away the pain
And think of ways to gain
Profits, and make deposits, say my name
Guap is gon' give me options, Ace of spades

[Refrain: AKA]
(Get the fuck out of here, oh)

[Chorus: AKA]
What would Iron duke do?
Ride around the city in a new coupe
All black, amBhakajuju
Batman, pull up in a master Bruce suit
Hard cash, that's the only thing I’m used to
God’s hand feeding me the sghubu, Amen!
You know you know the story well well
They call me crazy, yah vele
[Post-Chorus: AKA]
We ain't trippin' when the party close
If you ain't with it then it's adios
Am I Supa Mega a Super Mario?
Are you a pretender, are you a solid oke?
