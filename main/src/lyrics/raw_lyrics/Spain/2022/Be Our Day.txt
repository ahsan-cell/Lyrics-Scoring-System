What’s out there
I wanna feel everything I can
I wanna go
On a trip where
I can see everything there is, whoa

There’s nothing worse than feeling like you missed the boat
When all your friends keep telling you to take the jump
No better time to cut the ties that hold us back
This’ll be our day, this’ll be our day

Taking it slow
As we get there
No living fast and no dying young
Life is a show
And every blink is
Another missed opportunity
Yeah life will never slow

There’s nothing worse than feeling like you missed the boat
When all your friends keep telling you to take the jump
No better time to cut the ties that hold us back
This’ll be our day, this’ll be our dayYou might also like
