Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
Nobody better
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!

You tell me it’s a fantasy
You say he’ll never look at me;
But he’s already liked a picture on my Instagram
(Not to mention -)

In the middle of the night he comes to me in my wildest dreams
Reveals to me years and years its seemed
Life was going nowhere arе history
Cause the air, it shifts, when wе’re together
Olly Alexander
And Me

I wanna marry
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
I wanna marry
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
Monogamy’s a stranger
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
But not forever
(or with) Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
You might also likeYou tell me that he’s awful busy
Got no time for a guy like me
But he already liked a picture on my Instagram
(And don’t forget that - )

In the middle of the night he comforts me, makes me feel pretty
We speak only complex poetry
And our love surrounds us, somehow tangibly
While the earth’s core cools when we’re together
Olly Alexander

He comes to me in my wildest dreams
I get on one knee,  look up at my King
Propose sweet nothings  I’ve been told may mean
"Can I be with you, my dear, forever
Olly Alexander"?

In the middle of the night we drive away
“Don’t look back,” he’ll say
He loves me so,  we're never letting go;
Dreams accelerate, yet all of time stands still
Cause it’s “Clockstoppers” when we’re together
Olly Alexander
And me
