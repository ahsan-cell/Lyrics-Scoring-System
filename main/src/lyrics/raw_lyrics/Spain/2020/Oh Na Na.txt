Lord, I know You see there's water on my boat
But look, today, I won't be agitated
Promised I would trust You even through the storm
Now it's time to prove that I meant it
Ooh la-la
I will keep my eyes on the blue sky
Fingers on the strings, and find a new rhyme
I know it's not much, but it feels right
Oh, na-na
I haven't forgot what You've done for me
Always taking care of my every need
You do what You say and You say what You mean

[Chorus]
Jesus, as long as I'm breathing I'll praise Your name
Thanksgiving even when it's grey
Yeah, yeah, long as I'm breathing I'll praise Your name
Thanksgiving evеn when it's grey

[Verse 2]
O seu nomе è o mais maravilhoso do mundo
Je veux que tout le monde sache
Comme je t'aime, je t'aime
I don't have enough words, no
Lord, I know that all my verses will be cheesy
If I try to say all that You mean to me
You're in the rays of sunshine every morning
In the twinkling stars when I am yawning
You're the one I need when I'm tucked in bed
My pep talk before every set
You're my savior, father, my greatest friend
You said You'd be with me until the very end
Peace beyond all understanding
Everyday You have me singing
You might also like[Chorus]
Jesus, as long as I'm breathing I'll l praise Your name
Thanksgiving even when it's grey
Yeah, yeah, long as I'm breathing I'll praise Your name
Thanksgiving even when it's grey
Yeah yeah, long as I'm breathing I'll praise Your name
Thanksgiving even when it's grey (Thanksgiving even when it's grey)
Yeah, long as I'm breathing I'll praise Your name (I'll praise You)
Thanksgiving even when it's grey (Oh)
Yeah yeah, as long as I'm breathing I'll praise Your name
Thanksgiving even when it's grey
Yeah yeah, as long as I'm breathing I'llpraise Your name
Thanksgiving even when it's grey
