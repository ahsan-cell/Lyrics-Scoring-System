Welcome to the magic show
PREP cypher, we in here
Let's go

[Pre-verse sample]
You better watch your step
[Verse 1: J Dubs]
I been tryna make it on the radio; they still won't play me though
Rap about getting faded out in Vegas, that's they favorite show
Wish I could get some time like Steven, don't even know
The reason that these peeps committing treason on that classic flow
Raps still elastic yo, that elasticity
Cause these lyrical gymnastics, my competition history
Allergic to my flow, well they could pop an antihistamine
I could get this mint and then I'll cleanse their mouths like listerine
Listen to me, you know I spit that truth
Not yet getting blasted by the media, still in my youth
Am or fm, I pop em like exum
Balling like Australia, male Iggy Azalea
All I got is this mic cause that's my rap paraphernalia
Step to me, I'll make you cover up like genitalia
Radio rappers blow up? I'm soon to be derailing ya
Check, check, uh
You know these bars ain't for sale, but y'all eat em up kit kats
Quick to categorize me with Eminem or RiFF RAFF
Due to my pigment, that's just a figment
Of your imagination, connecting ish like ligaments
Guess you ain't in my class like girls obsessed with Asian station
Amazing
You might also like[Verse 2: Thamal]
Uh huh, I agree, you better watch your step
Before you slip, trip, dip, quick, and see just how inept
You are when it comes to text, I'm always first, never next
Forever blessed, and ???
Alpha, beta, gamma, my grammar hammer
I hit you with the strength of a verbal samurai ??? my head
Fill it with words, phrases, bricks I lay on the cypher foundation
My life without patience
And I hate it, but, I also love it
??? needing Hubble to see me through the perfect bubble
Then I left my shovel, verses found and buried
And I ain't leaving in a hurry, in fact
I think Imma go find my pen and paper sit myself down and write another rap
Man, I spit them 24 karat facts, so take another crack
I'll throw another molotov and show you why they call you wack

[Verse 3: Kendall Screen]
Yeah, dressed up to fine dine
Don't mind if I rhyme
Cuz these rap times and crimes hurt your body like Grime... -r
Like the Pok√©mon, you know I'm about to ??? like magic
Cover up like Johnson like a baby bottom got beat
When I was ???
Now I got no self-esteem, my whole life is blotted
Now I'm back and I gotta fly high
Started like a rich kid, in a rich school
Thinking that I'm so cool, but I'm not, I'm a fool
Acting like a tool, headphones playing so loud
You could rock me on cloud... 9
The main dish is served, you got what you deserved
I've never used a gun, should I make another pun?
Nah man, I'm done, and I would show you something
But I'm about to give ???
This shit was never rehearsed, you heard first
[Verse 4: Archduke Redcat]
I have to laugh, this cat asked for raps
I'm grinning like a winner, man, I bring class to class
Mind heads to the future, I've been past the past
But the flow is 90s like Jam Master's back
Acknowledge my knowledge and respect the intellectual lyrics
When you hear it you should fear it and what comes next
Nevertheless, get nothing less than the best
I'm blessed with the text, that vexes the rest
Man, who would've guessed that me-
I would rap with the raddest of cadence
So funky ingest the fragrance
Take the bait and get overtaken
Undertow'd by undertones and my spectacular vernacular;
Hold the Holy Grail and pour out my flow for these amateurs
Rap, killing it, bringing it back
Smack, you never look at me like that
You're wack, and all of your moronic raps
Are smelling like bad booty crack and that is a fact
Like how I'm the dapperest rapper straight off the crapper
I'm crafting these platinum tracks that'll capture me racks on racks
So call me Future... or someone with actual talent
Rap stallion: horsepower like cars from Italia
Gold medal level, whatchu got, a knock-off medallion?
Check your best s-word verse my verbal battalion
Get it? Because like, "S-word" that's a sword, yo
These lines tight like a cornrow
I make classics when I'm bored yo
Watch my flow capsize your lowly boat and know
That my mind explode with lines like my mentos and coke
[Verse 5: Yahya]
See, thanks for the tip but I make my earning in slips
Waiting on journey in red robes and gold bars
Since rap is gold chains and fast cars, ha
They never caught my attention because this is redemption no hype or pretending
Screw happy endings in verse the truth hurts a lies worse
Slip a red pill first
I lie cursed my self worth dispersed reversed then lost unearthed
In two seas of green eyed seen through light beams my life streams my one dream
Deferred
See once a coward
I lacked the power in my darkest hours
My blood ran in showers then chose the lightest flower
Fell off the tallest tower
Shoulda tripped and made the fall shorter but chances are that's a tall order
Live life no applause since fames a feckless cause
Toss the gauze off the wound there's no room for improvement
My bars are already the tightest and all my verses are righteous they got that rhythm and movement
Fans grooving and haters bruising if they snooze they lose and choose a quick descent
Before the flame quick repent to make a winged ascent
Lack of faiths for the brainless ill just face this reality
Because combat's mortal, fatality, but id do it again
That's dedication to my inspiration
She had me down bout my place in society and then they lied to me and then they tried to side with me
Burning inside of me resides ash from mistakes made decidedly
My lonely soul is filled with riches and I'm willing to split them to me no chances are given
Richly made poor decisions self made self staged so match is met and made remissive
Reminiscent of a constant threat thought I could safely bet
It wasn't setting in... odds are I wasn't betting to win but
Spotted next level with Jake and Jahmir and look im willing to share
But their my only competition most of yall are broke records
Repetition up and coming in the wrong position but look
The recognition I thought I earned I'll never deserve as I lie broken and burned
With my smoking token of regret I say hold your breath
Whoevers next
Maybe stop and rest cuz ya better watch your step


[Verse 6: Jah Aurum]
Seriously, girls is either feeling on me, or they're cheering for me
Everyone else is steering clear or they're fearing, it's me
The realest MC in this vicinity, me and this mic be giving off a synergy
Almost as hard as the Holy Trinity
You're giving me everything, don't you ever try to limit me or mimic me
Keep talking crazy, get your wig split like lickety
At your show, bro, that's where the crickets be
I should call you Jiminey, picture me in Sicily
Sipping tea, while the epitome of symphonies is sent to me from a higher entity
The crazy part is that's something you could probably begin to see cause how else would it be so frequently be ripping the beat
It's either that or Biggie's living through them vicariously and that facade man its scary to see
Cause you are a mere veneer for what is really sincere
What really is there is not nearly what you make it to be
Imma take what I need and leave, no need to make it a scene
You can't relate, homie, sorry, you wasn't the heat
Taking a beat if you caught the shakier knees
Yo, the tar matched the skin cause we was paving the streets
So basically, you're wasting your breathe but I give ya an E for effort and your girl she be taking the well, uh, you know what I mean
Yo, they wondering "You sure this just a hobby?" if i wasn't caught school, clothes and girls you prolly wouldn't have a job
See, I'm hotter than wasabi, don't you worry about where I be I mean I thought that it was obvi but I guess I gotta make things clear
I'm a trendsetter with a vendetta, better send better, all the do is make my pen redder
I'm the start of something great like the tenth letter
At this point I think I'm the greatest MC in a ten thou mile radius
For all of us who jaded threw shade at us the mark I'll leave in your cranium is craterous. Here, let me help you make a buck
Imma throw a party you can cater us brah
Yeah until they realize the common knowledge that they kid is Dalai Lama when his rhyming, yeah, shaman with the stars aligning ain't no signs of stopping now, even room for commas and the line of bull they be feeding you you will constantly be gobbling and swallowing many problems that me and my comrades are in all arising cause they don't like us chiming in
Its sickening to me, but hey what can I say man 16 year a slave homie you could call me Solomon6
