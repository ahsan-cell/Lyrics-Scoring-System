[Verse 1: Young Adz]
Grown man, I ain't in my feelings on the 'Gram (Nah)
Slowed down, now I'm only schemin' for the fam (Yeah)
We both rap, but I ain't competin' with you, gang
Tryna cop a crib and yard so when you see me, got a tan
I'm glad you came, I felt so lonely
Glad you came, I felt so lonely (Lonely)
So glad you came (So glad you came)
Yeah, and you be snappin' what I got you, showin' people what I bought you (Yeah)
All your hatin' cousins better watch the way I spoil you (Yeah)
All them jealous bitches that was hopin' that you leave
Hope they see them diamonds on you and it makes them weak
'Cah your friend got a man that beats her up and fuckin' cheats (How?)
But tryna give my lady advice, she got a cheek
Toast to them bitches, toast to them niggas (Yeah)
Not a tweet, driving lessons, hundred grand Jeep (Ski, ski, ski)

[Chorus: Young Adz]
Fast car like Lewis Ham', Ham', Ham' (Ha)
Thirty-two degrees, golden tan, tan, tan (Aha)
I think I'm your number one fan, fan, fan (Aha)
How you so elegant and so gang, gang, gang? (Aha)
Two hundred on the dash, autobahn, bahn, bahn
So elegant and still gang, gang, gang
So elegant and still gang, gang (Ski)
Don't worry 'bout your ex (Ski)
No nigga fuck my lady but me, that's my biggest flex

And he can't put his pole down, that's all he knows (Brrt)
Sort your mummy issues out 'cause when you grow, they'll show
Some of the realest niggas I know end up breedin' some hoes
Stayin' on my feet, I been standin' on my own
Rich nigga shit, I will never fold
If I hit the bitch, she ain't never told (Yeah)
Fast life, I been reapin' what I sow

[Chorus: Young Adz]
Fast car like Lewis Ham', Ham', Ham'
Thirty-two degrees, golden tan, tan, tan

No nigga fuck my lady but me, that's my biggest flex (Ski)

[Verse 3: Dirtbike LB]
Body count, I love the bitch, that's why I'm with her (Why I'm with her)
Malibu, we on the beach, we eatin' dinner (Eatin' dinner)
Kind of crazy you been changin' how I think
I'm just watchin' Sky Sports in this Rangey that I'm in
Made a mill' and all the patience was a thing (Yeah)
Said you with me, but you wasn't fully in (Fully in)
Said that you're glad that I came, I know (I know)
Said that you're glad that I came, I know (I know, you dig?)
Off a Perc', remember me that night? I was feelin' vulnerable (yeah)
Off a thirty, should've took a five, irresponsible
Ate that pussy on the dirty Sprite, I was honourable (That's right)
Grip the dirty nine, I feel those niggas comin' close (Close)
Pretty bitch with confidence, I love it when you moan (Uh-oh)
You thought you saw LB, that was Beezo, that's the clone
I pull up Lewis Ham', Ham', thousands on your skin tan, I won't let you go

[Outro: Young Adz]
Grown man, I ain't in my feelings on the 'Gram
Slowed down, now I'm only schemin' for the fam
We both rap, but I ain't competin' with you, gang
Tryna cop a crib and yard so when you see me, got a tan
I'm glad you came, I felt so lonely
Glad you came, I felt so lonely
So glad you came (So glad you came)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So glad you came (So glad you came)3
