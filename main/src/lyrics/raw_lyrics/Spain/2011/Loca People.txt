[Verse]
When I came to Spain and I saw people partying
I thought to myself, "What the fuck?"
All day, all night – all day, all ni-, all ni-, all night
Viva la fiesta, viva la noche
Viva los DJ's
I couldn't believe what I was living
So I called my friend Johnny and I said to him

[Chorus]
"¡Johnny, la gente está muy loca!"
What the fuck?
"¡Johnny, la gente está muy loca!"
What the fuck?
