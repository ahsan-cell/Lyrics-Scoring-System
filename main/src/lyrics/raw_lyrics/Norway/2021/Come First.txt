I've been sitting pretty in the passenger seat
So no one gets offended
I've been getting bitter always tryna be sweet
When I was just pretending

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna compromise
I'm not letting you get in my way, way, way
I don't wanna apologize
Gonna take my time, you gotta wait, wait, wait

[Chorus]
I don't care if your ego gets hurt
Baby, you should know I - I come first
I don't care if I get on your nerves
Baby, you should know I - I come first

[Post Chorus]
I come, I come, I come first
I come, I come, I come first

[Verse 2]
Know I said that I should think before I talk
But I'm just gonna say it (I, I, I, I)
I'd be good for millions if I got a dollar for
Every timе I faked it (I, I, I, I)

I don't wanna compromise (Nuh-uh)
I'm not letting you gеt in my way, way, way
I don't wanna apologize
Gonna take my time you gotta wait, wait, wait

[Chorus]
I don't care if your ego gets hurt
Baby, you should know I - I come first
I don't care if I get on your nerves
Baby, you should know I - I come first

[Post-Chorus]
I come, I come, I come first
I come, I come, I come first
I come, I come, I come first (Mmh, I come first)
I come, I come, I come first

[Outro]
Need you to impress me, interest me
Give me more than just words
No, I can't help it, call me selfish
But I, I - I come first
