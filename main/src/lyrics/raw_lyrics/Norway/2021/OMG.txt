Oh my god
I'm crashing into the sky
And it feels so good
The way you take me higher

[Verse 1]
You pull me in, I run away
But I can't see you with somebody else
You ruin it, I make mistakes
But I just wanna have you to myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Almost made it out'a, out of hell
And I was close to healing
Now I think I'm on my way again
Got me levitating

[Chorus]
Oh my god
I'm crashing into the sky
And it feels so good
The way you take me higher
Oh my god
I'm craving the way you lie
And it feels so good
You making me feel alive yeah

You le', you let go
You le', you le le let go
But never let me go

[Chorus]
Oh my god
I'm crashing into the sky
And it feels so good
The way you take me higher

[Verse 2]
Intoxicate, I try to leave
I cut my teeth on all the memories
About to break, you're killing me
But without you it's getting lonely

[Chorus]
Oh my god
I'm crashing into the sky
And it feels so good
The way you take me higher
Oh my god
I'm craving the way you lie
And it feels so good
You making me feel alive yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Almost made it out'a, out of hell
And I was close to healing
Now I think I'm on my way again
Got me levitating

[Chorus]
Oh my god
I'm crashing into the sky
And it feels so good
The way you take me higher
Oh my god
I'm craving the way you lie
And it feels so good
You making me feel alive yeah

[Bridge]
You le', you let go
You le', you le le let go
But never let me go

[Chorus]
Oh my god
I'm crashing into the sky
And it feels so good
The way you take me higher
