Asa, I gotchu
Look
I’m unleashin’ fear and the sheep in folks
Y’all better humbly revere the whole Fleece as GOATs
We the anomaly, I swear
Can only properly be compared
To shit like Monopoly; with the guap on me
They surrender they properties
When I pop the piece on these squares
And I never squash the beef
When I’m cockin’ the Glock, it’ll speak;
Call it a talk of peace
And embarrassing lil mockеries
Tryna stop the Fleece not prеpared
And that’s as ill as it gets
Shit will really get real
If you can’t deal with a diss you can get killed with a fist
He’ll get the gist when his wig’s peeled
Through the windshield of his whip
When I grip steel, it don’t miss
Stealin’ ya miss - said “Lips sealed.”
Then the shit sealed with a kiss
“Let the Beat Build” then I just-

(6 Foot 7 Foot)
-switch the beat up on up yo ass
Into Weezy since a lad
His Louisiana swag
Breathed new meaning into Rap
He’s the reason why I snap
US media’s a gag
Shit they’re feeding us is trash
I just see this shit and laugh
Stay mistreatin’ us and steady seein’ us as bad, then say BLM
It’s sad
Then they start stackin’ digits
Anti-corp, that means we back to business
Tap your bitch and then I drill her mouth to send her back with feelings like she at the dentist
That’s the past now
I used to wanna run in FashionFitted just to blast up in it
I’m more relaxed now, so if I go in MACs out (go and max out) then I’m at my limit
I’m like Hulk Hogan when I’m chokin’ a mic
Tho in the ‘yo I don’t write
Bow, gun or knife, foes gonna fold in a fight
Hoes wanna die
Dig a fuckin’ hole then I might-
You might also like(I’m Goin In)
-bury you in
I’m cold at League, but a casket about the only thing I’ll carry you in
And no, I don’t mean on Youtube, but I got a clip you can share with your friends
Behind the scenes we shoot crews, extend the clips then we air it again
Little snitch, he scared of the pen
When your place gettin’ hit
I take what I wanna take and I dip
They raisin’ the bar, but we breaking the shit
Ain’t painting ya car, but I’m spraying your whip
I came with my dogs in a rage in this bitch
Who break in a mall and go straight for the kicks
Like Cosmo and Wanda when they give a wish
I get what I want when they raisin’ the stick

(Burn)
You was supposed to be macho
You was a gangsta, I thought so
You pussies couldn’t compare, I run the underground like I’m Chapo
Better keep it movin’, don’t stare
Gon’ fuck ‘round and get popped hoe
This shit is musical chairs
Sit the fuck down or get your spot stole
Now I’m rockin’ with GF
Chopper that’s my BF
I’ll spray the scene and leave
With A, B, C’s, and Z’s you ain’t elite as me
And PS: this ain’t a Weezy beat
But taking Weezy’s lead, I claim to be the king of beat theft
L-double-E-C-E, don’t forget the F
Now let that bitch burn-
(Fireman)
-and when we spray, it don’t take long to cool off
And you ain’t buzzin with the fly shit, you hoes just oughta shoo off
When I bring her back, Thanos finger snap;
Half her clothes’ll start to fall off
Everything I’ve rapped’s
Like a finger trap
Shit I’ve woven’s hard to pull off-

(Steady Mobbin’)
-bitch
And that’s for certain
I beat the beat up when attacking verses
I’ll approach ya bitch to put the mack on her then get to stuffin pussy like a taxidermist
Til I smash I her cervix
Why you actin’ nervous
You were cool online but hella wack in person
And ya GAT ain’t burstin’
Man, you full of shit
Couldn’t pull a bitch
If you was snatching purses
‘Cause you lack the courage
I ain’t stopping til your pack is burnin’
Bitch, I’ll hook your posse up with matching hearses
Then come piss on coffins when I’m at your service
Come and try me bitch, we ain’t just rappin’ verses
And If you think I’m itching, you ain’t scratched the surface
I’ll set the stages once the MAC is purchased
So I’ll make this play and after that it’s curtains-
(Mona Lisa)
-and please do not compare this fuckin writin’ with these tyrants
I just opened a spiral and just wrote it in a song
He put that on the Bible
If he pull up on a rival then it’s on arrival
Turn his middle school to Viet Nam
It’s turned into a title, then he’s turned into an idol;
Plus he’s suicidal, it could be the movies or the mall
And all they ever do is turn an eye tho
Turned into a cycle
Turn on news and psychos try to tell us nothing’s even wrong
Mind’s open, seems my heart’s totally shut
These global leaders supposedly upholdin’ peace, while
Us normal people must leave our homes with heaters?
Abbott and the GOP knows, but he folds
How people on the East coast hold they pizzas
Golden Fleece is kings of dope releases
These Mona Lisa’s of vocal pieces
It's K
