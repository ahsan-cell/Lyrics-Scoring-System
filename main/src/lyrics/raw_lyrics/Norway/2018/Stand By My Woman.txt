There were times I wasn't kind
And there were times I wasn't even around
And there were times I made you cry
So many times I had to say goodbye
When you want to talk
I'm on the phone
But now baby, yeah, I am here for you alone

[Chorus]
I'm going to stand by my woman now
I'm going to stand by my woman now
Because I can't live my life alone
Without a home

[Verse 2]
There were times I didn't understand
And there were times I wouldn't hold your hand
But baby now I'm here for you
Because baby, yeah, I am so in love with you

[Chorus]
I'm going to stand by my woman now
I'm going to stand by my woman now
Because I can't live my life alone
Without a home
I'm going to stand by my woman now
I'm going to stand by my woman now
Because I can't live my life alone
Without a home
I'm going to stand by my woman now
I'm going to stand by my woman now
Because I can't live my life alone
Without a home
I'm going to stand by my woman now
I'm going to stand by my woman now
Because I can't live my life alone
Without a home
