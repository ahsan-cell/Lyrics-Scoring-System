All my life I been bottled up
Always living by that half full cup
Afraid of people saying I'm fucked up
I know that I'm fucked up

I like my coffee with a vodka shot
Drink it with a spliff to calm my thoughts
I ain't talking cotton candy stuff
You know shit gets rough

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need your prayer for luck
I'm just fine with what I got
I be up all night, firefly, working hard enough
I don't need to prove you wrong
You will see soon I know
'Cause I be up all night, firefly, working off the clock

[Chorus]
A shot across the bows I been telling you love
I do my own shit with that I want it done so
I don't need ya throes I've been telling you no
I'd rather smoke a joint than get on with you ah

[Verse 2]
What's saying mister Lancelot
You happy 'bout the fancy things you bought
Just lemme tell you that don't mean a lot
When that's all you got
'Cause when you talking I hear blah blah blah
You might also likeLike my coffee little bit stronger
Likе my nights a little bit longer
Like mе better little bipolar
I like a trip in the morning I keep on it

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need your prayer for luck
I'm just fine with what I got
I be up all night, firefly, working hard enough
I don't need to prove you wrong
You will see soon I know
'Cause I be up all night, firefly, working off the clock

[Chorus]
A shot across the bows I been telling you love
I do my own shit with that I want it done so
I don't need ya throes I've been telling you no
I'd rather smoke a joint than get on with you ah

[Bridge]
I get way too high I never sober up
You seen the shit I been doing ya it's a lot
I'm twenty something aiming for the top
You can say just what you want in your white fenced prop
Big ol' house and a Volvo car
A partner you don't even love
Well does it matter huh?
Pointing finger just 'cause I'm a dreamer
So I dyed my hair pink inked up to remind ya
[Chorus]
A shot across the bows I been telling you love
I do my own shit with that I want it done so
I don't need ya throes I've been telling you no
I'd rather smoke a joint than get on with you ah
