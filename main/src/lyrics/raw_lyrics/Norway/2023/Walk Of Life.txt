Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

[Verse 1]
Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
"Be-Bop-A-Lula," baby, "What'd I Say"
Here come Johnny singing "I Got a Woman"
Down in the tunnels, tryna make it pay

[Pre-Chorus]
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play
Dedication, devotion
He turnin' all the night-time into the day

[Chorus]
He do the song about the sweet loving woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life
Woo-hoo

[Verse 2]
Here come Johnny gonna tell you the story
Hand me down, my walking shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat, the talking blues
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh, yeah, the boy can play

He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Mmm, they do the walk of life
