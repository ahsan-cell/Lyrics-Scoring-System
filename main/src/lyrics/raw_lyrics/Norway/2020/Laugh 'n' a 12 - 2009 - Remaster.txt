I learned by uprightness my number of friends should increase
When I think about the things I've done
I laugh out loud to no one
Yeah to no one

Chorus:
Coz it's so hard to meet
The eyes that I see
When I try to open up my heart
There's something inside me 'n I know it's good
But understanding is misunderstood
At the end of a smile; there's a laugh 'n a 1/2
But I became honest Mr. Mistaken
In spite of the curves my smile was makin'
Bumpers and kickers in one big stream
I grew up in a life size pin ball machine
Yeah they're mean
Chorus
On my behalf
There's something inside me 'n I know it's good
But understanding is misunderstood
At the end of a smile; ther's a laugh 'n a 1/2
I tried to fill some silence
Coz the silence feels so long
I knew the ice was gettin' thinner
But I kept skating on
My mother threw me into this world as a winner
But by the light of the yellow beer
They tell jokes I'll never get to hear
On my behalf
There's something inside me...You might also like
