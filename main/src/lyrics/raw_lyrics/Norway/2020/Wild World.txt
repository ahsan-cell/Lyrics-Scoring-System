La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la

[Verse 1]
Now that I've lost everything to you
You say you wanna start something new
And it's breaking my heart you're leavin'
Baby, I'm grieving

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you have a lot of nice things to wear
But then, a lot of nice things turn bad out there

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
I'll always remember you like a child, girl

[Verse 2]
You know, I've seen a lot of what the world can do
And it's breakin' my heart in two
'Cause I never wanna see you sad, girl
Don't be a bad girl
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
Just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
Yeah

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la, la-la
Baby, I love you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But if you wanna leave, take good care
Hope you make a lot of nice friends out there
But just remember there's a lot of bad and beware

[Chorus]
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl, oh yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
It's hard to get by just upon a smile
Yeah, yeah
Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world
And I'll always remember you like a child, girl
