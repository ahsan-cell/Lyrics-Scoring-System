Daddy's in the jungle by the coconut tree
Momma wanted milk for her red Indian tee
Children read aloud form an old Edgar Rice
Grandma Knits a sweater wanna try it for size
Loves a holiday! Loves to get away!
And a lucky parrot criessssss

[Chorus]
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!

[Verse 2]
As the sky let's down all her night on the camp
Daddy's face looks funny in the light form the lamp
Grandma knows a tune thet she hummes in the tent
A little orphan from the strange orient
Children are all ears, Momma takes to tears
And this is how it weeeent

[Chorus]
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!

[Chorus]
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!

[Verse 3]
Daddy hears the sound of a dark distant drum
Granny says he's had to much dark navy rum
All the children laugh as they make it for bed
Momma looks amazed like an old knuckledhead
She can hear it to, and if it all is true?
This is what they sassssiiid

[Chorus]
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!

Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
Bomb bomb bomb! bomb Bomdadilla Life!
