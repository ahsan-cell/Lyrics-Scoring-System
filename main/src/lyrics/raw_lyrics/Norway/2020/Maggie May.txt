Wake up Maggie
I think I got somethin' to say to you
It's late September and I really should be back at school

[Chorus]
I know I keep you amused
But I feel I'm being used
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my heart and that's what really hurts

[Verse 2]
The morning sun when it's in your face
Really shows your age
But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything

[Chorus]
I laughed at all of your jokes
My love you didn't need to coax
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
Just to save you from being alone
You stole my soul and that's a pain I can do without

All I needed was a friend to lend, a guiding hand
But you turned into a lover
And mother what a lover, you wore me out

[Chorus]
All you did was wreck my bed
And in the morning kick me in the head
Oh Maggie, I couldn't have tried anymore
You led me away from home
'Cause you didn't want to be alone
You stole my heart, I couldn't leave you if I tried

[Verse 4]
I suppose I could collect my books and get on back to school
Or steal my daddy's cue and make a living out of playing pool

[Chorus 4]
Or find myself a rock and roll band
That needs a helpin' hand
Oh Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
You made a first-class fool out of me
But I'm as blind as a fool can be
You stole my heart, but I love you anyway
[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
Maggie, I wished I'd never seen your face
I'll get on back home, one of these days
Ooh, ooh, ooh12
