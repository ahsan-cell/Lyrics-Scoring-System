Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine
Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we're leaving broken hearts behind

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

I need perfection
Some twisted selection
That tangles me
To keep me alive
In all that exists
But none have your beauty
I see your face
Yeah, I will survive

Mystify
Mystify me (Yeah)
Mystify
Mystify me
You might also likeEternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Well, they kiss you every night

All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine
Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we're leaving
Yeah, we're leaving broken hearts behind
Mm hmm

You mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
You mystify me

You're eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Well, they kiss you every night

Mystify
Mystify me (Oh)
Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me
