You close your eyes
And leave me naked by your side
You close the door so I can't see
The love you keep inside
The love you keep for me
It fills me up
It feels like living in a dream
It fills me up so I can't see
The love you keep inside
The love you keep for me

[Chorus]
I stay to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I wish by God you'd stay

[Verse 2]
I stay awake
I stay awake and watch you breathe
I stay awake and watch you fly
Away into the night
Escaping through a dream
You might also like[Chorus]
I stay to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I wish by God you'd stay

[Post-Chorus]
Hey...
Stay...

[Chorus]
I stay to watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
It gives me time to stay
To watch you fade away
I dream of you tonight
Tomorrow you'll be gone
I wish by God you'd stay
[Post-Chorus]
Stay
Stay...
Stay...

[Outro]
I wish by God you'd stay
