Hey, what did you hear me say
You know the difference it makes
What did you hear me say

But I don't think so no more
I said it's fine before

[Pre-Chorus]

Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
I've changed my mind

[Verse 2]
So where did you see me go?
It's not the right way, you know
Where did you see me go?

It's not that I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
I've changed my mind
I take it back

[Chorus 2]
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind
Erase and rewind
Cause I'll be changing my mind

[Outro]
Erase and rewind

Erase and rewind
Hmm-hmm
I've changed my mind5
