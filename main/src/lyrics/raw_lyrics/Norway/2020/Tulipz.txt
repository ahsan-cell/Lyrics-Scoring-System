I try to forget
True love's in my head
I try to forget

What's that?

I'm collecting butterflies
Every colour, every size
I keep them in a glass jar
So I know where they are

And this one is a Silver King
And this one's got a broken wing
Tulipz in my head
I try to forget
Tulipz in my head
I try to forget

What's that?

Then make sure you're the chrysalis
The chrysalis is good to squeeze
My collection isn't big
I'm thinking about selling it

Onto someone without a brain

Tulipz in my head
I try to forget
Tulipz in my head
I try to forget

Tulipz in my head
I try to forget
Tulipz in my head
I try to forget

And this one's from America
I paid for it fifty dollars
Netted by the Sioux Indians
Near the Rocky Mountains

Butterflies take all my time
I wish I was a butterfly
Fly fly fly fly... Dance!

My collection isn't big
I'm thinking about selling it

Onto someone insane
Onto someone without a brain
True love's in my head

True love's in my head

True love's in my head
