"Guy back there called you Jésus"
"He didn't say Jésus. He said, 'Hey, Zeus!'
My name is Zeus"
"Zeus?"
"Yeah, Zeus! As in, father of Apollo? Mt. Olympus?
Zeus! You got a problem with that?"

[Verse 1: Vordul Mega]
Fascinated in the discovery of recovering components
Of a certainly instants analyzing captivating moments
From going through it, searching for restitution
Find a refuge inside a vest whose design will wreck ruins
Out of a bomb combining resolutions
Coming in incredibly adaptive, seeing it happen
In a set of movements to relaxed and very active
Sometimes subtle interferes
Gathering an intermission of images in a savent
Vicious synonyms in events of diligence
With conviction willing, given with precision

[Interlude:]

[Verse 2: Vast Aire]
I came up on a shitty block
Son, you might your snot box rocked over a skully top
And if she knows something then I want some top
But if she get around, I don't want that box
I rather watch Ralph McDaniel's
And bit your finger if you touch the channel
Too hot to hold, too cold to handle
You still half steppin' in your Clerenda sandal
My knowledge of Popeye, I'm strong till the finish
And I won't trip myself after I smoke spinach
I ain't no average rap god
Hanging onto my halo just won't fly
Lean in so you can feel this
My dragon palm is the realest
The pigeon that screams is distinguish
The order of the phoenixYou might also like2
