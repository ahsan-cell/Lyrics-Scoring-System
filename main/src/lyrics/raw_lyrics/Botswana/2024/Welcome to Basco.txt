[Verse 1: OneTake 267]
Welcome to Basco
The only place that I know
Where your girlfriend is another man's hoe
She gon' check the professor before exams and give him head on the low
When she with him, she prolly call you her bro
Double texts and no reply
Just know she's getting hit from the back
And that allowance, ain't cutting the check
She wants the latest iPhone
And besides you ain't giving her jack
Part of the reason shе ain't reply to your app
She's getting prеssure from all angles and sides
Her best friend is doing the most
And hooking up with influential guys
And to be honest dawg, I'm never surprised
The lifestyle of pool parties is flashing right in front of her eyes
Whatchu expect from a shawty like that
She's never had this way
Back in high school the come up was rough
She was bullied and skinny
And nobody ever showed her some love
So now she's switching 'cause she's thickening up
And that's her way of life
You might also like[Chorus: FAYE & OneTake 267]
Don't get carried away
And that's her way of life
Don't get carried away
Welcome to Basco
Don't get carried away
Welcome to Basco
Don't get carried away

[Verse 2: OneTake 267]
Welcome to Basco
The only place that I know
Where your homie can switch up for a hoe
He can go from becoming your brother's keeper
To someone you don't know
Like on the real, from a friend to a foe
He keeps forgetting the moments y'all niggas shared, from the bottomless pit
He's getting bitches now, he thinks he the shit
Very excited and looking for validation from them nigga he with
How many bitches do you think he done hit?
But now the danger is looming
He's bout to reap the benefits of his action
Hit it raw without no form of protection
How stupid, 'cause niggas be really thinking HIV is just fiction
Now he's bout to hit the ARV section, think about it
Ain't no form of degree could ever save you from this
You just another number put on the list, yeah
Ain't no form of degree could ever save you from this
I'll repeat, if you niggas insist man
Welcome to Basco
[Chorus: FAYE & OneTake 267]
Don't get carried away
Welcome to Basco
Don't get carried away
Welcome to Basco
Don't get carried away
Real life, welcome to Basco
Take care
Don't get carried away

[Outro: OneTake 267]
