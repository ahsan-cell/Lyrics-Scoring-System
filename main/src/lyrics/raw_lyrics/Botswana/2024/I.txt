Yah
Kgale ke tsaya dinepe
Di’fan di nkopa di bell
Mathata ba letsa magare masigo ba mpotsa ‘ntwana are you well?’
Of cause ntwana ke well
Everything sabawell
2010 neke ghaola beef stew shabela ka mabele
My whole life nkare scam
People stab me in the back
It’s kind of sad that I care for people but bone they care less
I got a hype can’t you tell
I can be Samuel L. Jackson
Indeed
I’m too deep
Kego betsa o tsеnye bandage
Motsetsеrepa se ba neele
Sukunyetsa till bana ba utlwa
Ba kue
Ba sie
From there oba tlogele
Heelang
Siang koo
Y’all are not safe for my glory
When I say tshasa mello
I pray so hard for madlozi

Everytime when I’m in the spot it’s a vibe
No I’m not lying
I got the vibe
Yeah I’m moving smooth super weird like Mordecai
I, I

Yah
I got the vibe everywhere I go
Betsa short shaya ding dong
When I get the money I stay indoor
Lot of people want to see me broke
I got the balls not regular size
Sometimes di ntlhabisa kgala
O ntshwara mapele kego roba letheka, molala coz gake batle go kwata
Bare ‘William Last too basic’
In that case then y’all are classic
I live my life ka masiki
Hope that part you get it
If you read a bible and you need some answers I’ll get them for you ke Bartholomew
Thousand people ke ditsala tsame when it gets staff I only see a few
People busy making fun of me
If they knew what I been through
Nna ke podi
Nna ke kgosi
My résumé is very neat
If you sniff me I smell good
And my voice sounds pretty cool
Ke ratwa hela jaaka Bull and Bush
Ooouuu
I, I

Everytime when I’m in the spot it’s a vibe
No I’m not lying
