25=Welcome to the Dinosaurchestra commentary!
90=The tick-tock sound that underscores this track is 120 beats per minute, which means that every "tick" is exactly one second apart.
230=This track is called 'Dinosaurchestra Part One' and it's about going back in time to form a band with all the dinosaurs.
331=200,000,000 B.C. was around the start of the Jurassic Period.
429=My name is Neil but I do play some instruments.
468=The first of many outright lies on this album. This ALBUM of LIES.
596=The word 'Dinosaurchestra' was invented by me, but has also been invented by several other peoplе.
800=Fun fact: This is my first musical referencе to the cannibalism of children.
920=The backwards loop featured in this song is part a later track on this CD.
1078=Several track transition segments on the CD were recorded in the junk drawer of my desk.
1120=Two spoons tapping 'Shave and a Haircut'.
1163=The distorted 'I'm bad!' clip at the beginning of this song is from the game Bad Dudes.
1290=I've never actually played that game.
1410=This song is about a visual cliche often used in action movies.
1487=I don't actually watch many action movies.
1566=I've definitely seen this cliche several times, though.
1692=The cliche: A character casually walking towards the camera in slow motion, as a gigantic explosion occurs behind them.
1782=Never batting an eye. Just looking cool even though their back is probably catching on fire.
1993=This is one of my few songs featuring real maracas!
2050=Many others have featured tofu maracas.
2185=It's also my only song using the word 'spiffy', which is odd because I love that word.
2447=Time to take it to the bridge.
2539=I like the crazy piano in this part. That's my Roland JV-80 doing its thing.
2622=I didn't bother trying to synchronize the stereo singing in this bit, because the narrator is supposed to sound slightly off his rocker.
2703=Cue sizzling wick.
2733=Then... KABOOM!! / GUITAR SOLO!!
2780=Most of my guitar solos are usually very intricately stitched together, instead of played in one take.
2835=I'm more of a Milhouse Van Houten than an Eddie Van Halen.
2925=I wish more action movie blooper reels included stunts gone tragically wrong.
3040=And so ends another happy story in Lemon Demon Land.
3249=Everything slows down, and in fades a pretty little synth...
3482=This song is half cheery optimism, half ironic denial.
3580=It is also three quarters retro, and one quarter Gonzo.
3749=That's a high pitched speech synthesizer saying 'One. Two. Three. Four???'
3919=Despite the song's hip surfy new wave feel, an accordion still found its way into the mix.
4073=The hi-hats are fake, but I still like to imagine a drummer focusing every ounce of his attention on them as he taps the ever loving hell out of them.
4218=Here the song's key changes from C to G, but continues using chords compatible with C.
4296=(Obligatory songwriting nerdery.)
4337=The references to the sun and moon marrying don't really have anything to do with anything.
4397=I just liked the subliminal solar eclipse imagery.
4525=This verse also doesn't have much connection to the rest of the song, but I nonetheless liked the sound of it.
4610=I hope this commentary isn't ruining the mystique too much.
4683=Oh boy, there are those hifalutin' hi-hat hijinks again!
4843=I like the subtle slow-wah effect on the bass notes in this part.
4958=It's hard to think of good trivia for this song. I'm sorry.
5114=Oh, here's this part. This part is quite a part, indeed! Oho!
5195=please shoot me
5210=Fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine fine.
5445=There's that slow-wah again.
5492=And the 'One. Two. Three. Four???' as well! Full circle!
5573=Yeah.
5679=Here's the breakdown. I combined the melody from the choruses with the melody from the bridges.
5837=And that about does it. I think it ends pretty soon.
5974=Fine, ladies and gentlemen!
6000=This song is about mowin' the lawn.
6055=It's called 'Lawnmower'.
6145=Once, when I was young, the grass in our back yard grew to be a couple feet tall.
6213=My father mowed it into a maze.
6288=I am still lost in that maze.
6350=I've actually only mowed the lawn once in my life.
6414=I did such a bad job that I was banned from ever mowing again.
6531=But I still think lawnmowers are cool, so I wrote this song.
6685=I want to take a lawnmower all around town.
6811=My great-great grandfather invented the lawnmower.
6864=But trimming lawns was not his original intention.
6913=He invented it to assassinate the President.
6964=He succeeded, took over the President's identity, and nobody ever knew.
7047=Except for his children, of course. The story has been passed down from generation to generation.
7186=Fun fact: Lawnmower fuel is made of cookies.
7239=Try some, it's delicious.
7327=Funner fact: The world's fastest lawnmower was capable of mowing a lawn in negative five hours.
7400=It would not run on regular cookie fuel. It required a special french toast fuel imported from Canada.
7540=Funnest fact: If you tickle a lawnmower's tummy it will go to sleep.
7660=Funnerest fact: Pope Pius XI owned a flying lawnmower.
7788=Bonus fact: The word 'lawnmower' appears in this song exactly 4,000,000 times.
7899=This song is called 'Stuck'.
7980=Because it's about being stuck.
8078=In a song.
8138=See?
8163=I can't whistle very well at all.
8216=That's my whistling with distortion added.
8359=This is the second track on this CD to mention my own name.
8430=Other than that, I have no other songs containing my name...
8481=Other than 'Hyakugojyuuichi 2003', in which my name is mentioned by a guest rapper...
8534=And 'Musical Chairs', in which I name check Neil Armstrong.
8639=I recorded the vocals first thing in the morning, so they sound really groggy and annoyed.
8703=Everyone just says I sound stoned.
8850=(I'm not.)
8970=If the character in this song DID have a name, it would be Carlos.
9066=And his middle name would be Betty.
9125=No last name though.
9341=I don't know anybody who actually skips this song. Poor Carlos Betty.
9445=It's not like anything interesting happens after that part.
9595=...
9787=....
9821=.....
9844=......
9851=.......
9874=!
9936=?
10010=Oh no.
10047=I screwed up another song's commentary.
10094=I'm really sorry, kids.
10286=Here's some more junk drawer noise.
10341=This time, police sirens fade in...
10397=And explosions and gunshots.
10459='The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny' is a very high concept song.
10510=It's also my 'hit' song.
10555=I came up with the idea with Shawn Vulliez, an animator with whom I'd worked previously on a song and video about Eric Bauman.
10659=Shaq Fu is a 90's video game, starring Shaq.
10702=One of Aaron Carter's biggest hits is a song called 'How I Beat Shaq'.
10755=Other than that, he has no place in this song, so I killed him off quickly.
10800=I wish I'd made Abraham Lincoln act a little less evil. He should be cooler than that.
10868=Shawn Vulliez, who animated the video for this song, wished I had picked someone easier to draw than Optimus Prime.
10975=The animation had over 6 million views, and was the #1 rated movie on Newgrounds.com for over a month.
11054=Got me a nice amount of CD sales too ^_^
11094=oh jeez, I'm sorry I wrote ^_^
11139=I bet Scruff McGruff was named after a real guy.
11200=At this point the fight starts becoming a free-for-all.
11336=Batman doesn't use guns.
11355=Jackie Chan's magical bullet deflection is my favorite thing in the song.
11444=When I was little, I used to lift my shirt and expose my stomach and yell 'CARE BEAR STARE!' at people.
11515=It worked too. I could shoot rainbows until I turned 8, when it suddenly stopped.
11615=Now... Chuck Norris shows up. When I first wrote this, Chuck Norris jokes were still cool.
11698=By the time the song was released, they were getting a little too played out.
11788=Luckily, Chuck ends up getting his ass handed to him.
11841=So this sort of serves as the symbolic tombstone for Chuck Norris humor.
11920=I still want to see more Walker: Texas Ranger clips on Late Night, though.
11969=I like the idea of Gandalves the Grey and White fighting side by side.
12014=The Blue Meanie from Yellow Submarine, not the wrestler.
12064=Lo Pan: Villain from 1986's Big Trouble in Little China.
12174=See? Chuck Norris was killed. It can be done, by the right combination of attackers.
12263=The final winner of the battle is Mr. Rogers. Some foreign listeners may not know who he is.
12306=He was the host of a famous children's show here in North America.
12349=A very nice, if vaguely creepy, old man who lived halfway in between reality and a horrible fantasy puppet world.
12404=Sadly, he passed on in 2003.
12440=In the animation, he commits seppuku after winning the battle.
12502=I'm sorry, Mr. Rogers.
12545=Forgive me.
12594=Now for 'Vow of Silence', a song about the art of willing mutedness.
12652=Throughout the song, there are actually very few points where I'm not saying anything.
12863=For some reason, I see playing violin as the best method of nonverbal communication.
12946=Mentalese is what you think in if you don't have a language. Babies and cavemen probably think in Mentalese.
13100=In real life, I wish I could be more talkative.
13166=I'm shy.
13202=I guess being silent would make me seem a little more intriguing.
13255=Of course... It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open one's mouth and remove all doubt.
13313=Abraham Lincoln said that. Or maybe Mark Twain. Or Benjamin Franklin.
13358=Actually, it was probably Edgar Bergen.
13418=Silence.
13469=This commentary was originally going to be an audio commentary.
13526=There wasn't enough room on the disc, however, so I went with text instead.
13584=That sort of has something to do with silence, I guess.
13804=The whistling in this part is me. I added a slight modulation so it would sound cooler.
13928=Teller of Penn and Teller. Silent Bob of Jay and Silent Bob.
13976=Both have been known to break out of character and utter lines in their films and shows.
14023=Harpo Marx, however, stayed true and never once spoke in any of the Marx Brothers films.
14075=He had a tongue, though.
14146=But Chico had no knees.
14231=I stole them.
14337=Okay, I lied.
14442=There's the silence! Hear it?
14495=This song is about the subconscious.
14542=I don't remember writing or recording it.
14602=I imagine that there are probably noises that we've heard our whole lives, and are so used to we cannot notice them.
14676=If not neverending hums, perhaps the sound of monkey screams, or elevator music.
14745=The point is... [memo to self: invent point]
14832=This song's sound is somewhat inspired by Japanese band Polysics, and the band that inspired them, Devo.
14930=Here I begin to expose the true inner workings of the human mind.
14996=Massachusetts is known as the 'Self-Aware Chowder State'.
15040=This is my take on scat singing. Just blabbering and spitting everywhere.
15118=The personalized critter I sing of is similar to a spirit animal, or totem.
15193=Historically, Native Americans carved 'totem poles' to serve as album liner art for their rock bands.
15267=Many of the songs performed by Kiss are in fact unauthorized covers of Native American rock.
15348=Corey the Armadillo, by the way, has successfully thwarted over 800 nightmares in my lifetime.
15427=By mind-critter standards, that's quite good. I owe it to my genes.
15500=This is more or less a 'breakdown' segment.
15547=But I see it as more of a 'remember the drums?' segment.
15621=Hmmmmmm.
15647=This is the part where I suddenly realized that I own a guitar.
15779=More insane person scat.
15828=Then the rocking fully commences.
15948=Writing this song taught many things about the subconscious...
15995=All of which I have forgotten.
16042=Perhaps it's better that way.
16114=Hmmm.
16163=Oh! Hear that ticking? You know what that means...
16214=Go away, 'Neverending Hum'. It's time for...
16269='Dinosaurchestra Part Two'! Sequel to the smash hit Part One.
16314=Featuring TRIANGLE, and ACCORDION.
16390=Guest starring HARSPICHORD, and JEW'S HARP.
16437=This is the simplest of the three Dinosaurchestra parts.
16480=Just some lalas, dodos, and a few lyrics.
16540=And my Stephin Merritt-ish impression.
16595=La la la la la la la?
16632=Bongos, accordion, backwards chipmunk gibberish...
16670=Do do do do do do do do do do do!
16713=And of course, my old friend Mr. Kazoo.
16770=Let's see what's in the old junk drawer.
16814=A couple of wooden sticks! I think I'll click them together and whistle!
16870=This track is backed by a squeaky birdcall sample which I stitched up to match the rhythm.
16938=It's one of my few recorded songs featuring a real bass, which was lent to me by my friend Alora Lanzillotta.
17000=She's good at the bass, but for this track I played it myself because I was developing the bassline throughout the recording.
17089=The lyrics do not have any particular meaning, they're just an assortment of words which I hope compliment the melody and mood in an interesting way.
17194=It might even seem like cute love song, if not for the Gollum-esque pluralization the narrator applies to himself... themself.
17298=I kinda like to think of this as being sung by the immortal old people from the film Being John Malkovich.
17382=Actually, the 'take your place' line refers to something so incredibly dorky I won't say what it is.
17488=No, I'm not telling.
17561=Forever a mystery may it remain.
17601=I never had any imaginary friends when I was young.
17661=I was such an uncool kid.
17708=Though I did really build a time machine once.
17748=No one believes me that it worked.
17798=The entire arc of this album is based on a true story. You'll see.
17870=The melody of this bridge was in my mind for a long time before I used it in this song.
17947=Actually, most of the parts of this song were unfinished songs before I scrapped them and remade them.
18022=The accordion here is the most prominent it gets on this album. Sorry fans.
18079=Fun accordion fact: Mine is named Cap'n Crunch, and has cut-out bits of a Cap'n Crunch box taped to it (including the Nutrition Facts.)
18207=I like the backwards echo on the guitar here.
18256=I vow to apply that to something odder someday.
18312=Maybe a bagpipe solo.
18354=Because a bagpipe solo simply won't be weird enough unless it has that trippy backwards echo.
18412=If You Give A Scotsman Acid
18440=Breakdown alert!
18461='Every wish that you've burned' refers to my favorite method of wishmaking, Bonfire Witchcraft.
18514=I don't worship Satan if you're wondering.
18563=Satan's an overrated hack.
18626=Better than Yanni, though.
18691=Imaginary what?!
18734=Oh.
18813=Anyway, what was I talking about... Yanni?
18864=Ah jeez, another lame commentary. Sorry.
18920=Why won't this song end?!
18952=I have nothing else to say about it!
19001=There, thanks. Okay.
19058=I put these two songs next to each other just so I could make a segue using bird sounds.
19118=This song reuses the theme of going back in time to prehistoric times.
19178=But despite its pretty tone, the lyrics are about jealousy and murder.
19257=No, that's not a joke.
19287=Backwards thunder on the right channel.
19310=I'm not sure why I used the doorbell melody throughout the song, but I like it.
19479='Fossils' and 'apostles', one of music history's least appreciated couplets.
19532=On the other hand, 'time' and 'alive' is a pretty piss poor rhyme.
19583=And 'jealousy' has absolutely no match in this rhyme scheme. Oh well.
19678=I hope the psychedelic backwards guitar effects make up for the rhyming inconsistencies.
19733='I Can't Get No Aviation' - Guess the classic rock reference, win a hug!
19810=Time to explain the lyrics... The narrator has a deep jealousy of birdkind's ability to fly.
19874=So he blames it all on the earliest known bird, the Archaeopteryx.
19942=(The hidden irony is that modern birds are probably not directly descended from the Archaeopteryx, which may not even have been capable of flight.)
20023=(I Wikipedia too much when I write songs.)
20082=Oh, now the song's hopping. Meow.
20130=I mean... squawk.
20192=Or whatever noise an Archaeopteryx is supposed to make.
20326=When I first recorded the singing for this song, I couldn't hit that high note without using my falsetto.
20379=For some reason, when I tried rerecording it later, I was able to. So I mixed both recordings of that part together.
20454=My recording methodology is so very dropoutish. Pray I never become a producer.
20550=Here's where the time travel comes in again. Mr. Narrator is about to head back in time to have a word with the bird.
20635=I'm really not sure why this stuff comes out of my head.
20714=Here are some words that can be spelled with letters in the word 'archaeopteryx':
20752=TREACHERY
20762=PROCREATE
20772=ARCHETYPE
20782=TAXPAYER
20792=APOTHECARY
20802=EYEPATCH
20812=APATHY
20828=OPRAH
20855=Like the Archaeopteryx, whether or not Oprah can fly is under debate.
20895=Now, the narrator snaps.
20934=He hopes he can alter the course of history...
20987=...and rid himself of the birds which taunt him in the present...
21045=...by busting a cap in Mr. Archaeopteryx.
21096=Yay!
21256=Now for an Archaeopteryx joke.
21305=An Archaeopteryx walks into the pharmacy...
21358=He says, 'I'd like to buy some lip balm.'
21420=The pharmacist says 'Will that be cash or credit?'
21461=Okay, here's the funny part.
21488=The Archaeopteryx responds, 'Just put it on my toothed, primitive beak!'
21542=Get it?
21580=Don't look at me like that.
21614=That joke knocked 'em dead in 65,000,000 B.C.
21706=(See... 'cause... that's when the dinosaurs went extinct. Ahehe...)
21757=Why does every song's commentary have to end in such an awkward fashion?
21819=This one's not even over yet.
21870=But it will be in a few seconds.
21922=Thank heavens.
22015=That sound was made with a pink toy keyboard I bought for ten dollars.
22077=The title of this song is 'Eyewishes', a pun of sorts.
22108=It features 5/4 verses, trichotillomania references, harpsichord, and disco rock.
22178=Eyelashes are my second favorite method of wishmaking.
22224=When one falls out, you blow it off your fingertip and make a wish.
22274=I imagined that someone very desperate for wishes might develop a compulsion which leads to yanking out all of their eyelashes.
22374=When arranging the drums, I used realistic bass and snare, and cheesy synth hi-hats.
22507=The harpsichord sound was filtered through an old-record emulator.
22600=Check out the seeeeeliiiiiiiide geetar.
22682=Again, most of the lyrics aren't about anything specific.
22752=Except when they are.
22799=Also: Paul is dead
22846=This song's really too idiosyncratic to dance to.
22895=Unless that's your style anyway, which I hope it is.
22987=Breakdown...
23031=It never breaks back up again, of course.
23095=My humming is about as bad as my whistling.
23315=Sort of a forced rhyme there, since the expression is 'followed in my footsteps.'
23394=Goodbye?
23430=Good bystanders.
23458='Bystanding' isn't a word.
23501=This short track is based around a slowed down version of the riff the last track ended with.
23554=It features a digitally distorted Little Tikes Tap-A-Tune from 1985.
23599=Each line of lyrics includes a play on a numerical prefix: bi, tri, quad, and quint.
23693=Ripley knew a Chinese dude with quadruple pupils. Odd.
23780=Ooh, there's some accordion again.
23846=Smoothest song transition on the CD, in my opinion.
23893=This is 'Indie Cindy & the Lo-Fi Lullabies'.
23954=A fictional one-girl band. I thought of the name before the rest of the lyrics, of course.
24082='Moe Is We' is a Spoonerism of 'Woe Is Me'.
24141=The lyrics are about a self-made musician with rather inconsistent confidence.
24218=Poor Cindy :(
24257=Whether or not her songs are good, she never lets anybody but herself listen to them.
24365=And she is rather down on herself.
24419=I have a Yamaha CS15 with a few broken keys. I may never know what they truly sound like.
24502=The backup vocals were originally in unison with the leads, but I discovered that they sound quite nice half a measure late, like an echo.
24645=An earlier version of this song included accordion, and a bizarre tangential rock ending.
24713=I like this version much better.
24796=Always sad when a solo project breaks up.
24869=One nice thing about working alone is the lack of 'artistic differences' issues.
24937=My studio looks like it's already been torn down a few times over.
25005='Cyclonic' and 'displacement' are both handy words for everyday use.
25074=Unlike Cindy, I do my recording upstairs, not in the basement.
25131=The basement is where I sleep. If I kept recording stuff down there, I might never leave.
25204=Sad but true. The music must be made.
25242=The rarely heard harmonica.
25293=Another instrument I can play, just not very well.
25351=I rock the lalas, though.
25426=And the F minor chords.
25483=This song features real bass, again.
25513=Amidst a clearly fake snare drum.
25571=This song's about asymmetry, an underappreciated characteristic if there ever was one.
25648=The narrator is singing to someone who is focused on being symmetrical and perfect.
25738=Okay, this first verse is sort of on the arcane side, but the theme is in there somewhere.
25815=I guess 'all you gotta do is just hit the switch' could be about plastic surgery.
25894=Yeah, that makes sense now that I think of it.
25983=Wizard of Oz references are hard to get out of me, but there you go.
26092=I do not use the word 'methinks' in everyday English, if you're wondering.
26162=I like the harmony here.
26209=If you slow down footage of somebody blinking, you'll notice that their eyes never close at the exact same moment.
26271=The muted guitar here also goes out of sync with the rest of the music.
26345=Ooeeoooooo...
26399=I kinda wish I'd made the stereo panning in this song more distinct and random.
26452=One thing I like about a lot of old Beatles recordings is the very uneven, asymmetrical stereo panning.
26527=Let your ears grow up independent of each other.
26580=The lyrics of this verse are probably my favorite on the whole CD.
26642=Probably the most violent, too.
26736=Gouge both eyes out and you WON'T see, actually.
26796='Self abyss': a pun on 'self abuse' and a Nietzsche allusion sorta.
26866=Filling one's eye sockets with mercury would probably hurt.
26916=Ooeeoooooo?
26988=Though subtle, this song does feature my trademark 'modulating square wave' sound.
27075=Astronomy lesson: The Earth has a 23.45° axial tilt.
27184=But do they make a sound?
27223=Oh look, direct Beatles reference. No monkeys in sight, however.
27289=I do not, in fact, have a suitcase, and if I did it would be full of old copies of 'The Onion'.
27346=And now for a very distorted electric piano solo!
27455=Totally wailing on it!
27511=Yep. Final chorus.
27575=But with extra lyrics!
27619=I saved the titular line for last.
27707=Ah, what else is in the junk drawer...?
27788=Oh look, synth!
27907=This is 'This Hyper World', a song about getting off your butt and hopping around and enjoying life.
28020=Once again, it's sung toward an unknown person.
28063=Might as well be toward myself, though!
28123=Lethargy is my blankie, sometimes.
28208=yeah
28349=eh commentary writing is hard
28424=brb
28558=Okay okay. Let's see. Something interesting about this song.
28622=The word 'oh' appears 7 times in this song.
28686=Its tempo is 172 beats per minute.
28767=Um... hmm
28818=Seriously no good trivia for this song. I give up.
28884=...
28970=I wonder if this song is really hyper enough.
29016=Rooftop marathons are probably quite difficult.
29080=I'm actually getting really tired just trying to think of things to say.
29151=This part's cool sounding.
29204=If a little annoying.
29242=This song changes to three different keys: C, A#, and G.
29308=This is the A# part.
29390=And this is the G.
29451=I use falsetto a lot in my songs, but usually as part of the backup vocals. This is the only part of any song I can think of where I used it solo.
29532=People say they can hear female vocals in some of my songs.
29584=No, that's all man.
29618=What can ya do about it?
29686=Claps are neatoriffic.
29737=As is the 'Tubular Bells' MIDI patch.
29793=And backup vocals.
29857=Oh!
29875=I don't know...
29895=what else to say.
29940=Oh well!
29998=brb
30132=Back.
30166=What's that? Creepy underwater sounds?
30209=And bubbles?!
30283=I recorded myself blowing through a straw into a pot full of water for this song.
30362=It's called 'Deep in the Ocean' and it's about... I don't even know.
30448=Well, it starts off about some human technology inadvertently dropped into the land of fish.
30548=This is a magical wristwatch, you see. It represents our souls or something.
30655=That's right, love.
30727=Tempo change!
30770=The ocean is tranquil, ancient, and completely unlike the land.
30842=Simply not our cup of tea.
30947=Ah, but time marches on... evolution occurs!
31011=Aquatic features are in store for us! What does this mean?
31066=Expansion, that's what. Overpopulation isn't such a problem when we can live underwater!
31164=We may not realize that we are lowering the property values.
31250=No matter, we must colonize the deep blue.
31288=And piss off the original inhabitants...
31386=Oh dear!
31457=An army of fish will manage to escape the ocean and invade our homes on land.
31521=Yes, the old switcheroo!
31570=And so, we will become scaly prisoners as the fish roam the land and cast the fishing poles. What irony.
31670=The big problem with living in the ocean is it's too dark to read books, and books tend to fall apart in the water anyway.
31749=So while we're still dry, do yourself a favor and read a book from your local library.
31834=Any book will do.
31892=This harmonica solo is courtesy of Dr. Harmonica, my harmonica.
32064=And his friend, Nurse Plastic Recorder.
32156=And Old Man Whistlie Lips.
32246=Shhh...
32295=It's the quiet part again. With bubbles.
32361=Bubblywubbly.
32476=Low synths and the sound of a fist smashing a piano in reverse...
32562=This part's kinda loud, I'm turning down my headphones, hang on.
32609=That's better.
32690=This part of the song is 120 beats per minute, meaning every other beat is exactly one second apart.
32788=Furthermore, if you play the chord loop backwards it becomes the Dinosaurchestra loop!
32850=This last little section describes some of the perils of sea life.
32954=Basically, getting eaten.
33014=Oh yeah, frigging whales will still be there. Now, they're pure evil.
33091=I just had to have a nice nautical ditty on this CD.
33161=No, the lyrics weren't written under the influence of anything.
33161=They're simply the truth as I forsee it.
33295=The tick-tocks return, for 'Dinosaurchestra Part Three'...the FINAL REVENGE.
33363=That's my voice put through a vocoder emulator.
33478=And without vocoder.
33638=This is the closest thing to a concept album I've ever done.
33693=Okay, most of the tracks are unrelated, but the overall arc is based on my adventures through time.
33794=You see, when I was about six years old, I created a working time machine out of various toys and furniture.
33872=I found myself in prehistoric times, among friendly dinosaurs!
33930=We started a wonderful band, called The Dinosaurchestra.
33971=Until one fateful day...
34032=Discovering my time machine had stopped working, I was left with no choice but to be hit by the meteor that destroyed the dinosaurs!
34114=I was only six, of course, and this upset me quite a bit.
34212=But I knew there was no way out, so know what I did?
34266=I wrote this song.
34436=My dinosaur friends were also quite upset, so I gave this song to them as a gift.
34495=I carved all the notes out on large stone tablets and passed them to everybody...
34591=Staring up at the ever-growing meteor, we all nervously picked up our instruments.
34672=Our audience, the giant insects and early mammals, began to cheer for us.
34747=And we played.
34830=We played louder than the loudest volcano!
34914=The sound was so loud that many of the dinosaurs began to 'freak out' and roar in tongues.
34988=Many nearby animals held lighters above their heads.
35059=Somehow, the rocking energy of the music was enough to fix my time machine!
35110=Not only that, but it seemed to have slowed the meteor down. I suddenly had a plan!
35182=One at a time, I quickly brought each dinosaur with me into the time machine.
35236=Each one I would bring far into the future, drop him or her off safely, and then return to the past to get another.
35312=By the time I got to the last dinosaur, a Monoclonius playing tambourine, the meteor was mere miles away.
35376=But we escaped, and finally I had the entire band safe and sound in a new era.
35438=I had to say goodbye to them, however, and return to my own time.
35513=When I arrived in my room, my parents came back and scolded me for making a mess.
35588=They took apart my time machine, and did not believe my story!
35696=However, I will be proven right in just a few days...
35758=...when The Dinosaurchestra suddenly appears on top of my roof...
35831=...playing the grand finale of a song that began millions and millions of years ago.
35970=The end.
36074=True story.
36132=I hope you enjoyed it.
36302=Just kidding. Dinosaurs can't play instruments.
36347=All they can do is stomp around and eat cavemen.
36400=Sorry to ruin the magic.
36443=...
36530=WAKE UP!!
36578=Mwuhahaha
36659=This is 'The Too Much Song'.
36752=Very simple, repetitive, dreamy kinda song.
36921=Rather mushy, too.
36996=Much too mushy.
37098=Each verse or chorus takes the last verse or chorus and adds new words to it.
37186=I tried to make it somewhat grammatical throughout.
37275=I just hope the lyrics don't come across as too cliche.
37343=I'm surprised to find that drawing from actual emotional experience tends to produce less imaginative lyrics than just pulling random crap out of my head.
37444=I guess maybe that says something about emotionalishness. It says 'Been there, done that.'
37520=But some songs ask to be written so politely, with puppy eyes, and it's impossible to say no.
37600=This is one of those songs.
37695=I hope it's catchy enough to make up for the whininess, at least.
37802=Maybe you should just turn it off.
37868=The last track was a pretty awesome finale, wasn't it? Why spoil the experience with this?
37973=Pretend this is the end credits music of a movie, and your friends are telling you there are no surprises at the end so let's go before the mall closes.
38075=Really, there are no surprises, the CD just ends after this song.
38150=I know, you'd think a wacky guy like me would just have to put something wacky there.
38222=Like seven minutes of silence followed by a short song about turkeys.
38286=But alas, there is no such song.
38374=Sigh...
38480=You probably think I was using reverse psychology, huh?
38562=This IS the end song!
38600=A mushy song about a girl, then it's all over!
38672=Well, I won't push it anymore. You've been warned.
38749=Actually, I like this song.
38832=I could've easily left it off the album, but I didn't.
38939=I don't know if anybody else will like it, but there are eighteen other tracks for that. Let me have this one.
39061=I was sad when I wrote it, but now it makes me happy.
39150=Happy and sorta sad.
39208=Bittersweet?
39283=Well, I'm a dork for listening to my own music, in any case.
39372=If it helps, I'll probably be sick of these songs for a while, now that the CD is done.
39470=But I hope you're not sick of them already!
39524=I've put over a year's work into this CD. Many folks have been waiting very patiently.
39593=For sitting through my laziness, I would like to thank everybody.
39690=And Especially You.1
