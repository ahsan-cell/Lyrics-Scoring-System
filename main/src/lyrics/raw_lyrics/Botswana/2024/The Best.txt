Always moving, started movements, lot has changed with what I’m doing
On the wave I started cruising, Hard to say I’m not improving
She like “baby how you do this? How you killing every verse
And always make the hottest music?” She afraid I’m not a human

How you have my number making rumors? You should stop assuming
I say don’t sleep on this, I told em they should stop the snoozing
Niggas don’t believe in the maneuver, til you start to prove it
She like Lemon Squeeze he ain't a boomer but he always boomin

Yeah told em not sleep, I told them stop the snoring
I don’t have no room for all the bullshit l’ve run out of storage
I need BTC, or maybe Mascom for that large endorsement
But as Lemon Squeeze It makes more sense for me to partner Orange

Yeah bring that cash deposit, need to khop a foreign
Need that Aston martin, and some profit, for that car insurance
Got the brand acknowledged, as iconic, You cannot ignore it
You know Tabz is charming, and a comic, he like Martin Lawrence

Yeah, Martin Lawrence, but no this is not a movie
Who you think the best outta the city if we’re honest, truly
I pick up the pen and when I do it’s like I’m rocking jewelry
Cause on every track, I’m dropping gems I be dropping rubies
You might also likeYeah I be dropping gems I be dropping rubies
I pick up the pen and it’s like I’m rocking jewelry
I see her intention by the way that she be talking to me
She turn on the Netflix but she know that we ain’t watching movies

Damn I got a massive ego
Partly cause I’m nice on every track, its always gang Umlilo
Sorry if I don’t fuck with you, the thing is I got bad libido
I just want it all, I want the whole thing, I’m like Frank Casino

Niggas at my neck, they feel like gang mosquitos
I wonder how this shit will be when I’ll be Bankin C-notes
Massive Zeros, Cash casinos, Black Tuxedos
Matching Chinos, gang Dineros, talking bout the cheese, nigga gang Doritos

Yeah album dropping, you know every track is Lethal
I’m not your favorite but your favorite couldn’t rap with me though
And how this shawty all on me although she has a negro
She prolly want me cause she hear I got a track with Veezo

Keep on talking green, cause that’s the language we know
You see my come up on the scene, I feel like Al Pacino
Shawty she a queen, yeah her skin tone on some cappuccino
She goin fuck with me, we’ll make a movie yeah I’m Tarantino

(Veezo View Verse)
Too many bars
(Outro)
I pick up the pen and when I do it’s like I’m rocking jewelry
Cause on every track, I’m dropping gems yeah I be dropping rubies
I pick up the pen and when I do it’s like I’m rocking jewelry
Cause on every track, I’m dropping gems yeah I be dropping rubies
I pick up the pen and when I do it’s like I’m rocking jewelry
Cause on every track, I’m dropping gems yeah I be dropping rubies
I pick up the pen and when I do it’s like I’m rocking jewelry
Cause on every track, I’m dropping gems yeah I be dropping rubies
