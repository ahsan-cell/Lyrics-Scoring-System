In the faded light you touch my body
I can feel your hands on my skin
Think you got me right where you want me
But you're just in my way

[Pre-Chorus: Theresa Rex]
I came to party on my o-o-o-own
Don't need nobody in my zo-o-o-one
I get down to the beat, I lose contro-o-o-ol
Eh-oh, I go so-oh, solo

[Chorus: Theresa Rex]
Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

[Post-Chorus: Theresa Rex]
(Dance, dance, dance)
Dance, dance, dance
(Dance, dance, dance)

In the shade of night, you're moving closer
We're on our way to cross a line
Think you got me right where you want me
But it's all in your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Theresa Rex]
I came to party on my o-o-o-own
Don't need nobody in my zo-o-one
I get down to the beat, I lose contro-o-o-ol
Eh-oh, I go so-oh, solo

[Chorus: Theresa Rex]
Boy, you can cool it down
Not here to fool around
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
I know you want me
But I don't care, baby
Just wanna dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance

[Post-Chorus: Theresa Rex]
(Dance, dance, dance)
Dance, dance, dance
(Dance, dance, dance)7
