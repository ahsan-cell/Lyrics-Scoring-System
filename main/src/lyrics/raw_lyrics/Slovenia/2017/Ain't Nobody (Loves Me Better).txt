[Verse 1: Jasmine Thompson]
Captured effortlessly
That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

[Pre-Chours: Jasmine Thompson]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh-whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

[Verse 2: Jasmine Thompson]
I've been waitin' for you
It's been so long
I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
You gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone
You might also like[Pre-Chours: Jasmine Thompson]
And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh-woah-oh-oh

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

[Bridge: Jasmine Thompson]
I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever
I make my wish upon a star
And hope this night will last forever

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
[Verse 3: Jasmine Thompson]
At first you put your arms around me
Then you put your charms around me
We stare into each other's eyes
And what we see is no surprise
Got a feeling most would treasure
And a love so deep we cannot measure

[Chorus: Jasmine Thompson]
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you
Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you27
