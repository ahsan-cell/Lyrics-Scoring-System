When pillow talks turn to pillow fights
Remember before you say goodnight
To make up before you go to sleep
So pillow fights turn to pillow dreams

[Chorus]
I'll go to sleep
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep tomorrow

[Break]
(I'll go to sleep)

[Verse]
When pillow talks turn to pillow fights
Remember before you say goodnight
To make up before you go to sleep
So pillow fights turn to pillow dreams

[Chorus]
I'll go to sleep
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
I'll go to sleep
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
(I'll go to sleep tomorrow)
I'll go to sleep tomorrow
