Turn your bed into my grave
Touch me, say goodbye
'Cause you know I'll never be the same
After tonight

[Chorus]
Put that poison on your lips, baby, take it slow
Lyin' in your arms, what a way to go, ooh
Might as well be my last breath
You wore that little black dress to my funeral

[Post-Chorus]
(Funeral)
(Funeral)

[Verse 1]
Put those masochistic kisses on my neck
Are you a devil or an angel? I forget
'Cause when we're skin to skin, I can't remember how it ended
Amnesia, baby, keep it so committed
Got my eyes on you, maybe aimin' too high (Funeral)
Trigger-happy, wanna watch it all back (Funeral)
When you let me in, I swear I'll only stay a minute
Singin' famous last words, baby, listen

Touch me, say goodbye
'Cause you know I'll never be the same
After tonight

Put that poison on your lips, baby, take it slow
Lyin' in your arms, what a way to go, ooh
Might as well be my last breath
You wore that little black dress to my funeral

[Verse 2]
Oh, give me love, lay with me until the morning (Ooh)
I wanna feel the warmth of your light
Here as a man (Ooh), a fool for you (Ooh)
Don't make me wait at Heaven's gate, just let me through

[Pre-Chorus]
Turn your bed into my grave
Touch me, say goodbye
'Cause you know I'll never be the same
After tonight
[Chorus]
Put that poison on your lips, baby, take it slow
Lyin' in your arms, what a way to go, oh
