Oh, I remember how you were
You were every shade of perfect
And then the colors blurred
And you'll never love me like you did
You'll never love, you'll never love me like you did
And I see your ghost from time to time
When I'm driving through the Rockies
And I feel this little knife in my heart
And it bleeds me out
Don't wanna love, I don't wanna love you now

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, how come all the best things fall apart?

[Chorus]
And it startеd pretty slowly
Oh, when you asked about thе old me
"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?" Oh, I don't know
I think I left him somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge
And, darling, now there's nothing left
And it started out so slowly

Oh, as I lay here by myself
And it's 4 a.m., I wonder
Did I put you through hell? Oh no
I need to know if you're okay
I wanna know, I need to know if you're okay, mm
And I hope that you're so damn sure that leaving me was right
Best thing you ever did, it was leaving me behind
Oh, woo-ooh-ooh, I couldn't blame you if I tried

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess even the best things fall apart

[Chorus]
And it started pretty slowly
Oh, when you asked about the old me
"Oh, is he gone? Oh, is he gone?" Oh, I don't know
I think I left him somewhere I no longer go
And I watch you run away now
From all the lovely things we hate now
Where did we go? Where did we go? Oh, I don't know
But I know it feels like somewhere far away from home
And it's falling into pieces
No, there's not a way that we can stop this now
One thousand miles an hour, we're driving off the edge
And, darling, now there's nothing left
[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Somewhere deep in you
Somewhere deep in me
Oh, there's still two lovers
So who the hell are we?
When I look at you
And when you look at me
Oh, there's still two lovers
So who the hell are we?
When I look at you
And when you look at me
Oh, there's still two lovers
So who the hell are we?
When I look at you
And when you look at me
Oh, there's still two lovers
So who the hell are we?

[Outro]
Who the hell are we?
(Oh, who the hell are we?)1
