And I just stand there
It's been a while since I heard my own voice
I just stand there
Just before she says that she loves me
She loves me
She loves me
(How I made you f—)
I sit with the night in appreciation
Of this ability to hear a world
I'm alive
I'm alive and I can feel it
(I just wanted to be safe)
She loves me
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just stand there
And my one-bed apartment feels like a coliseum
I feel prеtty, but in a handsome way
(I just wanted to be safе)
She loves me
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just stand there
And she looks at me like she's taking photos
Just stood laughing
At full lung capacity
And the first crunch of Tayto cheese and onion crisps
I'm wide-eyed at the window
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just stand there
(I just wanted to be safe)
And I just
And we spent sunrise to sundown in my room
Glued to the window, watching all the people go about their lives
And we decided their futures for them and ugly laughed
And I remember thinking to myself
"Don't you dare get used to this"
"Don't you dare" (Don't you dare)
Felt like all four seasons happened in one day
And I just stand there laughing at you
'Cause I can't believe this is real
And I just stand there
And I just
And I just
I just stand there
I just stand there
I just stand there
She loves meYou might also like
