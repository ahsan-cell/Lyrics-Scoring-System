I'm so lost, I'm so lonely
Maybe it's what I need to be
Saw the signs, let 'em lead me
To the ocean past your eyes
I'm so lost, I'm so lonely
Water rising to my head
Saw the signs, let 'em lead me
The unknown is all that's left
'Cause nothing's sure in between the sea and land
Everything's [shore/sure] in between the land and sea
I've been gone for so long in the in between
Mmm, in the in between
In the in between

[Verse 1]
Loneliness
Ain't a place to go, but one you gotta be left
On the edge
Afraid of the fact you might actually find yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
If you can wade out
To the deep and hold your head down
Underneath
Didn't know that I'd already drowned
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna scream, let the water rush in
It's the only place you left for me
If the ocean is lonely
Finally found myself in the deep
Been gone for so long in the in between
In the in between

[Verse 2]
I'm a storm
And the waves are crashing around me like a choir
Who'd have known
Drowning in loneliness brought me back to life

[Pre-Chorus]
And so I wade out
To the deep, unleash myself
Like a symphony
Might not like it, but welcome to the show

[Chorus]
I wanna scream, let the water rush in
It's the only place you left for me
If the ocean is lonely
Finally found myself in the deep
Been gone for so long in the in between
In the in between
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I wanna scream, water rushing
Drowning in me and in the between
I wanna scream, water rushing
Drowning in me, in between

[Outro]
I wanna scream, let the water rush in
It's the only place you left for me
Finally found myself in the deep
Been gone for so long in the in between
