So much hatred
Disillusion with this world
Betrayal is the focal point of my dissension
I tried to keep it right
With no remorse
I was left to die in the gutter
Nothing remains to strive for

No more
Consumed by the binds of failure
No more
Where the fuck did I go wrong?
Lies, lies
Repulsed by all you stand for
Lies, lies
Faith failed me

Stabbed in the back
The blood's still warm, the blood's still warm
These fallacies, they've claimed the best and shown the worst
They've shown our worst
They all strive to make their mark
It's still Impostors Kingdom
You failed me
Now I will fail you
You might also likeNo more
Consumed by the binds of failure
No more
Where the fuck did I go wrong?
Lies, lies
Repulsed by all you stand for
Lies, lies
You fucking failed me

No more lies

So much disdain
So much hatred
Disillusion with this world
Betrayal is the focal point of my dissension
I tried to keep it right
With no remorse
I was left to die in the gutter
Nothing remains to strive for

No more
Consumed by the binds of failure
No more
Where the fuck did I go wrong?
Lies, lies
Repulsed by all you stand for
Lies, lies
Faith fucking failed me
