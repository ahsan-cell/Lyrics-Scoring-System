I can spot a fake from a mile away
Oh, I can spot the bag and the girl that you date
She's playin' with your, playin' with your heart 'til it breaks
Oh, ah, ah

[Verse 1]
I got a sixth sense when it comes to a bitch
She's just a demon blowin' a kiss
Oh, god (Mm, mm)
Oh, god (Mm, mm)
She's like a white sheep, what could she ever do?
She's just a bad wolf comin' for you
Oh, god (Mm, mm)
Oh, god (Mm, mm)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh) I know you're lost in her eyes
And everything underneath
Her body makes you go blind, but
Not me, not me

[Chorus]
I can spot a fake from a mile away
Oh, I can spot the fake in her beautiful face
Yeah, she could put thе, she could put the devil to shamе
Oh, ah, ah
I can spot a fake from a mile away
Oh, I can spot the bag and the girl that you date
She's playin' with your, playin' with your heart 'til it breaks
Oh, ah, ah

Her little hairband hiding her horns

Oh, god (Mm, mm)

And everything underneath
Her body makes you go blind, but
Not me, not me (Oh)

[Chorus]

Oh, I can spot the fake in her beautiful face
Yeah, she could put the, she could put the devil to shame
Oh, ah, ah

Oh, I can spot the bag and the girl that you date
She's playin' with your, playin' with your heart 'til it breaks
Oh, ah, ah
