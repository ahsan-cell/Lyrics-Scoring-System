How could you love somebody like me?
Tryna be cold, but it's making you weak
I couldn't hurt somebody so sweet
But it's turning me on just watching you leave

[Post-Chorus]
How could you love somebody like me? Ah
Could you? Could you?
How could you love somebody like me?
Could you? Could you?

[Verse]
How could you love somebody like me?
I'm not worthy (Worthy, worthy)
I haven't touched your body in weeks
'Cause I'm not worthy (Worthy, worthy)
And though you try, you could never fix me
I know you wanna believe
I couldn't hurt somebody so sweet
But, baby, won't you rot with me? (Rot with me, rot with me)

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna feel good when I'm makin' you scream
I wanna feel pretty, baby, can you teach me?
Don't wanna be dramatic, but I swear if you lеave
I'd be broken
You might also like[Chorus]
How could you lovе somebody like me?
Tryna be cold, but it's making you weak
I couldn't hurt somebody so sweet
But it's turning me on just watching you leave
How could you love somebody like me?
Tryna be cold, but it's making you weak
I couldn't hurt somebody so sweet
But it's turning me on just watching you leave

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah (Could you?)
How could you? (Love somebody like me)
Could you? Could you?

[Outro]
How could you love somebody like me? (Ah)
Could you? Could you?
How could you love somebody like me?
Could you? Could you? (Ah)
Worthy, worthy, worthy
