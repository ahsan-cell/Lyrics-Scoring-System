This fire in my lungs is burning slow
Like tupelo and whiskey
If you had half a heart, you'd let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
I hate how much I still need you
To be the one to save me from this hell
You keep putting me through
I try to run, but always come back
I’m stuck on it

[Chorus]
Hot honey
Always have to wonder what you want from me
Guess it's not enough to stick around (Oh no)
Ooh
It's like you love to let me down
I need that sweet something
I’m stuck on your lips, that's why I keep coming
But you never want to stick around (Oh no)
Ooh
It's like you love to let me down

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing sweeter than the way you lie
The second you think I'm gone
You show up in the middle of the night
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know that I still want you
To be the one to save me from this hell
You keep putting me through
I try to run, but always come back
I'm stuck on it

[Chorus]
Hot honey
Always have to wonder what you want from me
Guess it's not enough to stick around (Oh no)
Ooh (Oh no)
It’s like you love to let me down
I need that sweet something
I’m stuck on your lips, that's why I keep coming
But you never want to stick around (Oh no)
Ooh (Oh no)
It’s like you love to let me down

[Post-Chorus]
It's like you love to let me down
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
It's like you love to let me down, oh
It's like you, it’s like you, it's like you love to let me down
Let me down, down, down, down
It's like you, it's like you, it's like you love to let me down
Let me down, down, down, down
[Outro]
This fire in my lungs is burning slow
