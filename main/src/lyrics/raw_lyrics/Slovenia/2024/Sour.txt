They said her beauty was beyond compare
With auburn hair, and fiery stare
But the mirror tells a different tale
I don’t see her standing there

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I lost myself, for a minute there I suppose
Oh, but now I'm back
Feeling the rhythm taking a-hold

[Chorus]
I can be sweet
Or I can be sour
Making you daydream about me for hours
I can be cool
Or I can be karma
Don’t need your love no more, I’m empowered

[Post-Chorus]
Broke my heart but now my eyes are dry
Thoughts of you will never cross my mind
Please, pleasе, believe whеn I say (I say)
I'm the one that got away

[Verse 2]
My revenge was walking door to door
There ain't nothing like a woman scorned
And I ain’t nothing like the girl you knew
I'm so much better than before
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I lost myself, for a minute there I suppose
Oh, but now I'm back
Feeling the rhythm taking a-hold

[Chorus]
I can be sweet
Or I can be sour
Making you daydream about me for hours
I can be cool
Or I can be karma
Don’t need your love no more, I’m empowered

[Post-Chorus]
Broke my heart but now my eyes are dry
Thoughts of you will never cross my mind
Please, please, believe when I say (I say)
I'm the one that got away

[Bridge]
Ooh-ooh, I wanna got away
Ooh-ooh, I wanna got away
Ooh-ooh, I wanna got away
Ooh-ooh, I wanna -

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I lost myself, for a minute there I suppose
Oh, but now I'm back
Feeling the rhythm taking a-hold
[Chorus]
I can be sweet
Or I can be sour
Making you daydream about me for hours
I can be cool
Or I can be karma
Don’t need your love no more, I’m empowered

[Post-Chorus]
Broke my heart but now my eyes are dry
Thoughts of you will never cross my mind
Please, please, believe when I say (I say)
I'm the one that got away
