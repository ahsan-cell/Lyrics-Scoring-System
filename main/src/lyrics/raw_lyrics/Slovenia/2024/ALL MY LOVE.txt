We've been through low
Been through sunshine, been through snow
All the colours of the weather
We've been through high
Every corner of the sky
And still we're holding on together

[Chorus]
You got all my love
Whether it rains or pours, I'm all yours
You've got all my love
Whether it rains, it remains
You've got all my love

[Verse 2]
And till I die
Let me hold you if you cry
Be my one, two, three, forever

[Chorus]
'Cause you got all my love
Whether it rains or pours, I'm all yours
You've got all my love
Whether it rains, it remains
You'vе got all my love

La-la, la-la, la, lay
Whether it rains or pours, I'm all yours
La-la, la-la, la, lay
That's all, all I can say

[Chorus]
Ooh, you got all my lovе
Oh, for now and always, till the end of my days
You got all my love
You've got all my love2
