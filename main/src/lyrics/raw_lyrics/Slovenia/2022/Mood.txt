Cut ties with everyone
'Cause I'm a disease
I wanna suffer in silence
Come and go as you please
'Cause I've seen this before
And I'm numb to it all
And I don't know who I am

[Chorus]
Dancing with desire
Lucid and dreaming in the night sky
Lost in illusion
I'm fading out, fading out, fading out
I fear my light is dimming out, dimming out, on me

[Verse 2]
The truth is that I wanna change
I may not make it another day unless I escape
From the places my mind likes to go to first
Thought I got through but I'm fucking cursed
I'm in my own way

[Chorus]
Dancing with desire
Lucid and dreaming in the night sky
Lost in illusion
I'm fading out, fading out, fading out
I fear my light is dimming out, dimming out, on me
You might also like[Bridge]
Cut ties with evеryone
'Cause I'm a diseasе
I wanna suffer in silence
Come and go as you please

[Breakdown]
Just leave!
Just leave!

[Chorus]
Dancing with desire
Lucid and dreaming in the night sky
Lost in illusion
I'm fading out, fading out, fading out
I fear my light is dimming out, dimming out, on me
Dancing with desire (Dancing with desire)
Lucid and dreaming in the night sky (Dreaming in the night sky)
Lost in illusion
I'm fading out, fading out, fading out (I'm fading out)
I fear my light is dimming out, dimming out, on me

[Outro]
Dancing with desire
