I took some time away
For understanding of what brought us here today
Oh-oh, you'll be the end of me
I'm never happy like we were happy
I'm never sad like we were sad
Oh-oh, you'll be the end of me

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause, oh-oh, you'll be the end of me

[Verse 2: Jeremy McKinnon]
I know I wasn't perfect, but I kept trying
'Til I forgot why I stayed
Oh-oh, you'll be the end of me
Yeah, we lost all meaning, we lost the magic
So good luck to you on your way
Oh-oh, you'll be the end of me

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause, oh-oh, you'll be the end of me
(You'll be the end of me)

I get it, no, I get it
Gave more than I took back, oh well
(Took back, oh well)
I get it, no, I get it
Can't help those who don't wanna be helped

[Chorus: Jeremy McKinnon]
You know me all too well
And I can't suppress the memories
You're gone and I can tell
That I've lost more than you'll ever see
Don't say that it's not fair
That you're not the person you wanna be
'Cause, oh-oh, you'll be the end of me

[Outro: Jeremy McKinnon & Kevin Skaff]
You'll be the end of me22
