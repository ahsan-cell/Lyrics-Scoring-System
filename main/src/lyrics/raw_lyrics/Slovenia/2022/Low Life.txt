Turn off your television
They're selling superstition
Criminals and victims, slaves to the system
Prisoners to the pain
The whole world's addicted, tangled up and twisted
Panic pumping through our veins

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, baby, they say I'm a low life
'Cause I sold my soul to the devil
Gave up my life for the right price
But I'll survive, I'm just a low life type
I'm a low, I'm a low, I'm a low life
I'm a low, I'm a low, I'm a low life type

[Chorus]
They'll drag you down into the dirt
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
They'll show you what it's like to hurt
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
Yeah, you're no better than me

[Verse 2]
If I'm on the wrong side of heaven
Then I know I won't be forgiven, ooh
Pray I'm accepted, plagued and infested
Preaching I'm the one to blame
Never said I'm perfect, I guess that makes me worthless
They tell me almost every day
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Well, baby, they say I'm a low life
'Cause I sold my soul to the devil
Gave up my life for the right price
But I'll survive, I'm just a low life type
I'm a low, I'm a low, I'm a low life
I'm a low, I'm a low, I'm a low life type

[Chorus]
They'll drag you down into the dirt
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
They'll show you what it's like to hurt
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
And they'll pull you 'til you come apart
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
To turn you into what you hate
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
Yeah, you're no better than me

[Bridge]
It's a shame that you think I'm a failure
I can still see a man with his head held high
But what can I do to make it right?
You're still gonna think I'm a low life type
I'm a low, I'm a low, I'm a low life
I'm a low, I'm a low, I'm a low life type
[Chorus]
They'll drag you down into the dirt
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
They'll show you what it's like to hurt
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
And they'll pull you 'til you come apart
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
To turn you into what you hate
(I'm a low, I'm a low life type)
Yeah, you're no better than me
