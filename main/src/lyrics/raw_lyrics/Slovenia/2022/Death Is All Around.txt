Death is all around
Death is all around

[Verse 1: Joel Birch]
I am either head in the clouds, or six feet underground
I just can’t get ahead of myself when no one is around

[Pre-Chorus: Ahren Stringer]
You wanna know what love is to me?
It’s barely holding on and gritting my teeth
Knowing what I hold, is more precious than gold

[Chorus: Joel Birch & Ahren Stringer]
I call, I call, I call, I call
And I hear you, can you feel me?
I am so down, can you feel me drown?
I fall, I fall, I fall, I fall
I don’t hear you, can you feel me?
There is no sound, death is all around

[Verse 2: Joel Birch]
I’m still thinking of the end most days
In my sleep, I call out your name
I hope you can forgive the shame
Of living with one foot in an early grave

You wanna know what love is to me?
It’s barely holding on and gritting my teeth
Knowing what I hold, is more precious than gold

[Chorus: Joel Birch & Ahren Stringer]
I call, I call, I call, I call
And I hear you, can you feel me?
I am so down, can you feel me drown?
I fall, I fall, I fall, I fall
I don’t hear you, can you feel me?
There is no sound, death is all around

[Bridge: Joel Birch]
There is not a sound, death is all around
Can you feel me drown? Death is all around

[Chorus: Joel Birch & Ahren Stringer]
I call, I call
And I hear you, can you feel me?
I am so down, can you feel me drown?
I fall, I fall, I fall, I fall
I don’t hear you, can you feel me?
There is no sound, death is all around
Death is all around, death is all around1
