Can you be next heartbreak?
I won't call it a mistake
I just want you right now
Love like this don't come often
So I'll just keep on talking
I've been dancing in circles
Hoping you'd fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so fixed on your lips
Time feels so frozen and I
Never wanna press play, so

[Chorus]
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer

[Post-Chorus]
Come a little closer
Don't be shy
Come a little closer
Let's get older tonight
Come a little closer
You might also like[Verse 2]
Yeah, we met in thе summer
Or maybe it was fall
I feel a connection
I'm gonna brеak down your walls
I wanna wake up in your arms
Count the beat in your heart
I've been waiting on someone like you from the start

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so fixed on your lips
Time feels so frozen and I
Never wanna press play, so

[Chorus]
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer

[Post-Chorus]
Come a little closer
Don't be shy
Come a little closer
Let's get older tonight

[Instrumental Bridge]
[Chorus]
Come a little closer
Come a little closer
Come a little closer

[Post-Chorus]
Come a little closer
Don't be shy
Come a little closer
Let's get older tonight
Closer

[Outro]
Maybe this time tomorrow
You'll at least want to stay
Maybe this time tomorrow
There won't a heartbreak
