Tell me how I'm supposed to beg when I'm
Feeling like I'm dead inside and living in a microscope
(Maybe I'm, maybe I'm fine)

Numb no feeling into me this time
You put your plug into me then it died and I forgot to choke
(Maybe I'm, maybe I'm fine)

[Chorus: Michael Barr, Myke Terry]
This time, it's too late
You tell me that it's your mistake, but
Everything that you say to me, you won't bend
Over and over again

You'll run, and I'll stay
Still wishing that you'll come back someday
Everything that you say to me, you won't bend
Over and over again
(Over and over again)

[Verse 2: Myke Terry, Michael Barr]
Hold my breath and tell you that you're right
Can't fake another feeling when you feed me with your antidote
(Maybe I'm, maybe I'm fine)
You might also likeTell me that I'm really on your mind
Tell me that Iâ€™m really not just living in your light alone
(Here I go again)

[Chorus: Michael Barr, Myke Terry]
This time, it's too late
You tell me that it's your mistake, but
Everything that you say to me, you won't bend
Over and over again

You'll run, and I'll stay
Still wishing that you'll come back someday
Everything that you say to me, you won't bend
Over and over again

[Bridge: Michael Barr, Myke Terry]
I wasn't worth it, it didn't work
We'll never make it past this moment
Lost in a memory, it never ends
You make me break but I won't bend

I wasn't worth it, it didn't work
We'll never make it past this moment
Lost in a memory, it never ends
You make me break but I won't bend
[Chorus: Michael Barr, Myke Terry]
This time, it's too late
You tell me that it's your mistake, but
Everything that you say to me, you won't bend
Over and over again

You'll run, and I'll stay
Still wishing that you'll come back someday
Everything that you say to me, you won't bend
Over and over again
Over and over again
(Here I go again)1
