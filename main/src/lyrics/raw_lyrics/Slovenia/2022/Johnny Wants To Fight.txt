Yo, Johnny, man, it's me
I heard some shit's been going down with your girl
I'm really sorry to hear that, man, that sucks
But hey, look, if you're not doing anything tonight
We're all going out, Hollywood Sunset Strip
We'll have some drinks, meet some girls
Start some fucking trouble, fuck, I don't know
Should be a good time, man
Maybe help you forget about your situation
I don't know, well hit me back if you wanna come out
Peace, brother

[Verse 1]
My best friend's home while his girlfriend's sleeping around
He's drunk and he's mad and he's looking for somebody to pound
He cheats all the time and he plays like hе don't even miss her
But now hе's fucking mad 'cause he knows that somebody was with her

[Pre-Chorus]
Something must've gave me away

[Chorus]
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him kick some fucking ass into the ground
Saying, "Hallelujah"
Taking fucking shots on the rocks
With the rockers and the freaks
That sell us the coke and ketamine
Shallow loser
Salvation is so far away, yeah
If Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him paint some fucking face all over the town
Saying, "Hallelujah"

But I'm guilty and it's starting to show
The truth is the girl told me everything I needed to know
Her clothes were on the ground
She was down, she was ready to go
Anybody would've done something so natural, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
How the hell'd we end up this way?

[Chorus]
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him kick my fucking ass into the ground
Saying, "Hallelujah"
Take your fucking shot
Give it everything you've got
Because the people wanna see it, baby
Shallow loser
Salvation is so far away
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him
Get it, I'm just saying I'm not holding the town
Hallelujah (Yeah)
Hallelujah (Oh-oh-oh)
Hallelujah

[Bridge]
And I'm wrong 'cause I slept with her a lot, and I
I wanna tell him, but I think I'd better not
'Cause I shoulda fucking run
But she's hotter than the sun
And every day she's fucking with me
Take this fucking halo from me
[Spoken]
Yo, it's Johnny, man
Next time, I see you
You're fucking dead!

[Chorus]
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him break my fucking nose until I'm barely breathing
Hallelujah
Take your fucking shot
Give it everything you've got
Because your girlfriend put her body on me
Shallow loser
Salvation is so far away
Yeah, if Johnny wants to fight, let him fight
Let him paint my fucking face all over the town
Saying, "Hallelujah"

[Outro]
Johnny wants to fight, yeah, uh
Johnny wants to fight, yeah, uh-uh
Johnny wants to fight, yeah, uh
Johnny wants to fight1
