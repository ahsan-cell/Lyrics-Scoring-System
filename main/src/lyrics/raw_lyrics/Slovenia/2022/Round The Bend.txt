Okay, you're gonna take my shot and miss?
Yeah
What're you doing?

[Verse 1]
I've been waiting in the parking lot
I've been living with a broken heart, you know
Been thinking since we fell apart
Am I okay? Am I okay?
So I keep driving somewhere in my car
I don't know where, I just know it's far
You didn't say, didn't say goodbye

[Chorus]
So keep your hands on the wheel
'Cause I'm going 'round the bend
And the way that I feel is hard to understand
But it's too broken to mend
So I'm going 'round the bend

[Verse 2]
I've been searching for your red tail lights
I've been looking in the dead of night, you know
You used to make everything alright
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
So I keep driving somewhere in my car (My car)
I don't know where, I just know it's far
You didn't say, didn't say goodbye
You might also like[Chorus]
So keep your hand on the wheel
'Cause I'm going 'round the bend
And the way that I feel is hard to understand
But it's too broken to mend
So I'm going 'round the bend
So I'm going 'round the bend
So I'm going 'round the bend

[Chorus]
Keep your hands on the wheel
'Cause I'm going 'round the bend
And the way that I feel is hard to understand
But it's too broken to mend
So I'm going 'round the bend
So keep your hands on the wheel
'Cause I'm going 'round the bend
And the way that I feel is hard to understand
But it's too broken to mend
So I'm going 'round the bend (Woo)

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm going 'round the bend
(And the way that I feel)
And it's hard to understand
But it's too broken to mend
So I'm going round the bend
