(1,2,3,4)

I feel a hunger
It's a hunger that tries to keep a man awake at night
Are you the answer?
I shouldn't wonder when I can feel you with my appetite

With all this power you're releasing
It isn't safe to walk the city streets alone
Anticipation is what I'm feeling
Let's find the key and turn this engine on

I can feel you breathe
I can feel your heart beat faster (faster, faster)

And take me home tonight
I don't want to let you go till you see the light
Take me home tonight
Listen honey
Its just like Ronnie sang
"Be my little baby"

I get frightened in all this darkness
I get nightmares and I hate to sleep alone
I need some company
A guardian angel to keep me warm when the cold winds blow!
