Let me take my fucking bracelet off

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do

[Verse 1: Machine Gun Kelly]
Damn
I saw you walk in the room and I tried my best
Not to panic while I'm lookin' for the back door
I smelled the perfume and it's obvious
I'm gonna stay and put my key in the bag more
I can't, I can't, I can't pretend to forget
You're the reason I punched a hole in the wall back home
And then, and then, and then a couple hours later
We're in room 29 at The Chateau

[Pre-Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
I left before you woke up
I don't feel right (Seeing you sober)

[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly]
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waiting
But I won't wait on you
Want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too

I've wasted so much time
Waitin' around for your phone calls every night
My bad dreams are silk-screened
'Cause I taste blood when you bleed
It's eating me alive
We'd both be better off alone
Still think I'd get you on the phone
With one last breath in me
I'd die before I let you leave

[Pre-Chorus: Halsey, Halsey & Machine Gun Kelly]
You left before I woke up
Why don't I ever see you sober?

[Chorus: Halsey]
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waiting
But I won't wait on you
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too

[Bridge: Machine Gun Kelly, Halsey & Both]
Hey you
Tell me why you do the things that make me
Hate you
It's an emotional kaleidoscope when I
Face you
Permanent calligraphy, I just
Tattooed
Your name on me forever, fuck
[Chorus: Machine Gun Kelly & Halsey, Halsey]
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too
You tell me you hate me, baby
Yeah, I bet you do
I'm keepin' you waiting (Waiting)
But I won't wait on you
You want me to forget you
Okay, forget me too28
