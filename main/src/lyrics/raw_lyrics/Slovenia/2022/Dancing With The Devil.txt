Oh-woah

[Verse 1]
It's just a little red wine, I'll be fine
Not like I wanna do this every night
I've been good, don't I deserve it?
I think I earned it, feels like it's worth it
In my mind, mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay, but I was lying

[Chorus]
I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil
Mm-mm-mm, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
It's just a little white line, I'll be fine
But soon, that little white line is a little glass pipe
Tinfoil remedy, almost got the best of me
I keep praying I don't reach the end of my lifetime, mm

Twisted reality, hopeless insanity
I told you I was okay, but I was lying

[Chorus]
I was dancing with the devil, out of control
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know
Playing with the enemy, gambling with my soul
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil

[Bridge]
Thought I knew my limit, yeah
I thought that I could quit it, yeah
I thought that I could walk away easily
But here I am, falling down on my knees
Praying for better days to come and wash this pain away
Could you please forgive me?
Lord, I'm sorry for dancing with the devil
Oh, yeah-yeah

[Chorus]
Dancing with the devil, out of control (Yeah, yeah)
Almost made it to Heaven
It was closer than you know (Closer than you know)
Playing with the enemy (Oh), gambling with my soul (Woah, woah)
It's so hard to say no
When you're dancing with the devil, mm
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, mm51
