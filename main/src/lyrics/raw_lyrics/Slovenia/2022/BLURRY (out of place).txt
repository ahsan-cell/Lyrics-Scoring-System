Take it all back
A little closer than I needed
So scared that I might be here alone
Take it all back now
To the places I tried leaving
Every map I follow leads to the unknown

[Pre-Chorus]
I should know, but I'm scared I’m right
Bend and break to see through the lines
Afraid to frame my life
I should know, but I'm scared I'm right
Bend and break to see through the lines
It’s easier than saying goodbye

[Chorus]
Why do I still feel so lost?
Why do I still seem out of place?
Everyone's out of focus
Everything blurry looks the same
Why do I still feel so lost?
I feel so far away
Why do I still feel so lost?
Everything blurry looks the same
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Why do I? Why do I? Why do I?
Why do I? Why do I?

[Verse 2]
When I look back
I never seem to see things clearly
I'm dizzy, yeah, I've spun out of control
'Cause when I look back now
To the lie I keep repeating
I'm so scared that I believe it
(I'm so scared that I believe it)

[Chorus]
Why do I still feel so lost?
Why do I still seem out of place?
Everyone's out of focus
Everything blurry looks the same
Why do I still feel so lost?
I feel so far away
Why do I still feel so lost?
Everything blurry looks the same
Everything blurry looks the same

[Bridge]
I should know, but I’m scared I’m right
Bend and break to see through the lines
It's easier than saying goodbye
[Chorus]
Why do I still feel so lost?
Why do I still seem out of place?
Everyone’s out of focus
Everything blurry looks the same
Why do I still feel so lost?
I feel so far away
Why do I still feel so lost?
Everything blurry looks the same

[Post-Chorus]
Why do I? Why do I? Why do I?
Why do I? Why do I? Why do I still feel out of place?
Why do I? Why do I? Why do I?
Why do I? Why do I? Why do I still feel out of place?7
