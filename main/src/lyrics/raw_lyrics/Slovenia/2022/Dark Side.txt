Been getting louder
Can’t drown
Them out

Kinda feels like I’ve
Lost all my power
Now it’s been replaced
With doubt

Whisper in my ear
Promise I’ll get comfort there
Can’t help but be scared

Oh dear it pulls me in
Temptation based on sin
Diving off an edge with no repair

I’m going to the
Dark Side
Where there’s
Peace of mind
I don’t need no company
I’m used to the lonely

Going to the
Dark Side
Maybe thеre
I will find
A sliver of my sanity
Don’t have much latеly
You might also likeI’m going to the
Dark Side
I think I’ve lost my mind

I’m going to the
Dark Side
Cause I’ve already tried being the

Good guy

Lately life hasn’t
Been very kind to me
The cards
Are stacked (stacked stacked stacked)

All my life breaking rules
Was the enemy
Now that’s under
Attack

Create your own luck
Fuck everyone else
They only give a damn
About themselves

And oh dear it pulls me in
Temptation based on sin
I think I could use some help
I’m going to the
Dark Side
Where there’s
Peace of mind
I don’t need no company
I’m used to the lonely

Going to the
Dark Side
Maybe there
I will find
A sliver of my sanity
Don’t have much lately

I’m going to the
Dark Side
I think I’ve lost my mind

I’m going to the
Dark Side
Cause I’ve already tried being the

Good guy

Pains me to say it
This world wasn’t built
With honesty as policy
It was built on guilt
And it pains me to admit
I’ve been playing the game wrong
Always played by the rules
And it made me a pawn

So now I’m going to the
Dark Side
Where there’s
Peace of mind
I don’t need no company
I’m used to the lonely

Going to the
Dark Side
Maybe there
I will find
A sliver of my sanity
Don’t have much lately

I’m going to the
Dark Side
I think I’ve lost my mind

I’m going to the
Dark Side
Cause I’ve already tried being the

Good guy
