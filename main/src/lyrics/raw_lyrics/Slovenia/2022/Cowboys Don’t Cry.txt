I'm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said cowboys don't cry?
Come on, baby, let's take one last ride

[Chorus]
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're ridin' 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
Gettin' dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end

[Verse 1]
It's too much, I can't take anymore
Stuck feelin' like we've been here before
But now the sun stopped shinin' here in the Wild West
My heart stopped beatin' and it sunk into my chest

[Chorus]
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're ridin' 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
Gettin' dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end

Just an outlaw who only had one friend
I wonder if I'll ever see her face again
Dark clouds hangin' over, they follow where I've been
My cowboy tears are still blowin' in the wind

[Chorus]
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're ridin' 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
Gettin' dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not good at goodbyes
I miss the sunshine in your eyes
Who said cowboys don't cry?
Come on, baby, let's take one last ride

[Chorus]
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
If you catch my drift
We're ridin' 'round this wagon wheel
She took me for a spin
We're ridin' 'round this carousel
Gettin' dizzy 'til we're sick
Love is like a circle
There's no easy way to end7
