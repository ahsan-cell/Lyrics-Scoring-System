Live for the mess, make me feel ageless
No pain, no gain
Teach me carelessness
And I'm about to see all that's made up
And everything they want from us
No pain, no gain
Once bitten, make way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't hide it
I won't fight this yearning feeling inside

[Chorus]
Gotta get better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)
Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)

[Verse 2]
There's nothing more to say to back it up when I'm unafraid
I've lost enough
Go on, hold on for dear life
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I won't hide it
I can't fight this burning feeling inside

[Chorus]
Gotta get better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)
Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love

[Bridge]
Won't you lean on me
You can lean on me
Let them look, don't know, don't care
Go deep with me (Hey)
Go deep with me (He-hey)
Go deep with me (He-hey)

[Chorus]
Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)
Better love, better love
All that we're after
Way to love, who you love (Who)
[Outro]
Who you waiting for? Who you waiting fo-or?

Who you waiting for? Who you waiting fo-or?
Who you waiting for? Who you waiting fo-or?
Who you waiting for? Who you waiting fo-or?
Who you waiting for? Who you waiting fo-or? (Better love, better love)
Who you waiting for? Who you waiting fo-or?
Who you waiting for? Ooh-ooh-ooh23
