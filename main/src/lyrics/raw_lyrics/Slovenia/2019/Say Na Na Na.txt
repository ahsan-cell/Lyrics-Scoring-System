[Verse]
You look sad and lonely
Is something wrong tonight?
Why this rush to run away?
Things will be alright
Just be strong and look at me
Hear me when I say
Who cares that you're outta love?
It happens every day

[Pre-Chorus]
All your dreams have gone away
No matter what you do
Love all colors of this life
And to yourself, be true
Don't forget my number
Call me anytime
I will always tell you life is beautiful and fine

Say na na na
On a dark deserted way, say na na na
There's a light for you that waits, it's na na na
Say na na na, say na na na
You're not alone, so stand up, na na na
Be a hero, be the rainbow, and sing na na na
Say na na na

[Post-Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
All your dreams have gone away
No matter what you do (Tell me)
Love all colors of this life
And to yourself, be true (Is it true?)
Don't forget my number
Call me anytime
I will always tell you life is beautiful and fine (Na na na)

Be a hero, be the rainbow, and sing na na na
Say na na na (Na na na)
[Bridge]
If you're feeling lonely (If you're feeling lonely)
We can take it slowly (We can take it slowly)
Think I'm going crazy (Think I'm going crazy)
Yes, I'm going crazy
We can all go crazy
Bir, iki, üç

Say na na na
On a dark deserted way, say na na na
There's a light for you that waits, it's na na na

You're not alone, so stand up, na na na
Be a hero, be the rainbow, and sing na na na
Say na na na, say na na na10
