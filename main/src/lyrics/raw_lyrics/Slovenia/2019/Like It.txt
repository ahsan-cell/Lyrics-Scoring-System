I guess I forgotten to turn my phone
Off I'm outside my comfort zone
I’m tired of being lonely, tam-tara-ram
Nobody gonna like this, no
Okay, I don't like these empty words
I'll go even if it really hurts
It’s making me stronger, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what should I do?
It's up to you, karma
Oh, I wish I knew
Give me a sign, karma
Just to remind you
I don't give up (Give up)
I won't give up, no
I'll always try

[Chorus]
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
Let me in your heart
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
Let's break the rules
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
I'll share what I’ve got
Yes, you gonna like it, yes, you gonna like it
Baby, repeat my moves

It feels crazy and a little wild
I know what is wrong and what is right

The universe is ours now
Okay, put your favourite sneakers on
And show your emotions on the floor
Add hashtag to find ya, tam-tara-ram
I know it's gonna be

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, what should I do?
