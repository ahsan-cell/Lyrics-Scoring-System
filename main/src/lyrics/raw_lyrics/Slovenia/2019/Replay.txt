You got a problem, 2AM I'm in your head
Let's just be honest tonight, yeah
Only I can solve it
You're twisting, turning in your bed
Them sheets need my body tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when you call me, that's when you call me
Say you're feeling lonely
Early in the morning, early in the morning
Time is moving slowly
We keep it undercover
I know you miss the taste
Heart beats like an 808
You need my love on replay

[Chorus]
Replay, replay, replay, yeah
You need my love on replay
Replay, replay, replay, yeah

[Verse 2]
You stuck on me darlin'
Like a love song on repeat
Yeah, you've got a problem, alright, yeah yeah
And I know I'm the one to blame
Because I make you scream my name
And baby, I'm all in tonight, mmm
