Hear these words that I sing to you
I will make it clear, it's me and you
We can have this love that we never lose
It’s bigger than us, mhm

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand and I'll lead you home
Can you understand?
You will never be alone

[Chorus]
It's bigger than us
It’s bigger than you and me
It's bigger than us
It's bigger than everything we see
'Cause I can feel the universe
When I'm feeling you breathe
It's bigger than us
And it's bigger than you and me
It's bigger

[Verse 2]
I won’t give up, and I won’t let go
'Cause this kind of love is gonna be our only hope
