No, I can't stay here longer
You cannot make me cry
So, I will leave you to wonder
What will become of our lives

[Pre-Chorus]
I’ll swallow hard, fall apart
Break and bleed but you won't see

[Chorus]
Tears won't fall
While pride stands tall
Maybe they can’t be heard or seen
But tears aren't quiet things
They scream, they scream, oh
They scream, oh

[Verse 2]
Though my throat is on fire
My eyes will be liars
And they'll try to stay drier
Until you turn away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll swallow hard, fall apart
Break and bleed but you won't see
You might also like[Chorus]
Tears will fall, I hear them all
They scream (Scream, they scream)
They scream, oh

[Bridge]
Not so silent and innocent
Acid rain from your fingerprints
Echoes, rivers of loneliness
Hitting the walls of my heart

[Chorus]
They scream, oh (Not so silent and innocent, acid rain from your fingerprints)
They scream, oh (Echoes, rivers of loneliness, hitting the walls of my heart)1
