I'm tired, tired of always losing
I tried to stop your fire
Turns out that I couldn’t
I'm tired, tired of competing
I tried to hold you under
But honey, you kept breathing

[Pre-Chorus: Carlotta Truman & Laurita Kästel]
When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me
But I left no room for you
Calling you my enemy, but my enemy’s right here
It was my mistake to try and break
That power that I feared

[Chorus: Carlotta Truman, Carlotta Truman & Laurita Kästel]
I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Oh, you gotta know I'm with ya
Now, shine like city lights
Torches in the sky
Don't you try to hide it

I'm sorry, sorry for the drama
I tried to steal your thunder
Turns out I don't wanna

[Pre-Chorus: Carlotta Truman & Laurita Kästel]
When you said you wanted the world
I said you couldn't too
You were walking right beside me
But I left no room for you
Calling you my enemy, but my enemy's right here
It was my mistake to try and break
Your power that I feared

[Chorus: Carlotta Truman, Laurita Kästel, Carlotta Truman & Laurita Kästel]
I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Don't you try to hide it
Sister, sister, sister
Don’t you try to hide it
Sister, sister, sister
Don’t you try to hide it
I see flames in your eyes
Damn, they burn so bright
Oh, you gotta know I'm with ya
Now, shine like city lights
Torches in the sky
Don’t you try to hide it
Don't you try to hide it
