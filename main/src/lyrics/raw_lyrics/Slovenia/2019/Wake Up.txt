I wake up every night
I can't find anyone to pray
Somewhere in the light
Changing all up
I'm afraid, on the side
Looking out for the lines to say
Someone has the light
Feeding our fire

[Chorus]
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
Don't want your lies
Don't want your lies, I need truth
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
No one will cry
No one will cry if it's true

[Verse 2]
I'll wait for the sign
I can't find anyone to stay
But there's something in the light
Saving our lives
You might also like[Chorus]
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
Don't want your lies
Don't want your lies, I need truth
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
No one will cry
No one will cry if it's true

[Bridge]
And I can't face you now
No, I won't break you down
If I can't find you, I won't hide you
It's not what I do

[Chorus]
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
Don't want your lies
Don't want your lies, I need truth
I came to fight
I came to fight over you
No one will cry
No one will cry if it's true5
