Hey, how you been?
I wonder, do you ever think of me?
Say, am I wrong
To wonder if it could be you and me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late for love? Hmm
Is it too late for love? I wanna know
Is it too late for love? I can't take no more
Is it?

[Chorus]
I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)
Hear me
I could make it burn for you and me

[Verse 2]
Days came and went
But nothing ever really felt the same
You left a space
Where everything reminds me of your face
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Is it too late for love? Hmm
Is it too late for love? I wanna know

[Chorus]
I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)
Hear me
I could make it burn for you and me
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?)

[Bridge]
We could be a storm that rages on
And maybe we would own the ocean carry on

[Chorus]
I could be the sun that lights your dark
Maybe I would lit your world with just one spark
I could make it burn for you and me
If I could be there, I would be there
Hear me
I could be the sun that lights your dark
(Is it too late for love? Is it too late for love?) Is it too late for love?
But is it too late for love?
Is it?5
