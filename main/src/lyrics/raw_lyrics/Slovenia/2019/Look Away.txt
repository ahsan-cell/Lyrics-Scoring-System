There's something you should know
I can't sing a love song anymore
There's something going on
And I can't turn my back on it anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
How can we go to sleep at night
And lay there in our beds?
When we know what's going on
With the world today

[Chorus]
Is it in my head?
Am I the only one?
Is it in my head?
Where the war has just begun?

[Drop]
We look away, look away, look away, look away, hey
Look away, look away, look away, look away
Is it in my head?
Is it in my head?
Look away, look away, hey, no

[Verse 2]
There's something in the air at night
That feels so different
And I don't understand
I didn't see this one coming

[Chorus]
Is it in my head?
