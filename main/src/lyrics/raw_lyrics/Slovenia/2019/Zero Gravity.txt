Hey you (Hey you, hey you)
It's me again
Hey you (Hey you, hey you)
Stone in my shoe

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been aching
Feeling low
You're so heavy
I have got to let you go

[Chorus]
I'm going where there's ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity
Ze-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-ero
Gra-a-a-a-a-a-avity
Zero gravity
I'm free

[Verse 2]
Hey you (Hey you, hey you, hey you)
Lock with no key
Hey you (Hey you, hey you, hey you)
Earth with no sea
