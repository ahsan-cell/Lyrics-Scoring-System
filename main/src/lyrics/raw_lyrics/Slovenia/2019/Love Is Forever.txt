Travel the world to see
The ruins of what has been
Learning our history
But still, we don't take it in

[Pre-Chorus]
Why we make it tough? The world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

[Chorus]
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love

[Verse 2]
Come over my long lost friend
And work on a happy end
Imagine what we could do
After what we've been through
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Why we make it tough? The world has had enough
Don't get too political
And who are we to judge? It doesn't take too much
Only just a miracle

[Chorus]
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Love is forever
Love is forever and everyone
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love

[Verse 3]
Venez découvrir la vie
Ce soir on va tous partir
Le beau temps n'est pas fini
Qu'en dites-vous, mon ami ?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hvorfor ska' vi slås? All we need is love
Liebe ist für alle da
Kærlighed er håb, alle ka' forstå
Kærlighed er samme sprog
[Chorus]
L'amour est pour toujours
L'amour est pour toujours et pour tout le monde
L'amour est pour toujours
L'amour est pour toujours et pour tout le monde
Just a taste of love, a taste of what
Could actually rule both me and you
A taste of love is all we got
So don't you never ever give up love23
