I see 22, oh, when I think of you
Lately, that's all I do
Don't you know that I, I'm always driving by
Wanna come home to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I've always been afraid to say
How I feel, but this's got to change

[Chorus]
Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you
Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue
At your house, number 22

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, where are you?
Number 22

[Verse 2]
I see 22, oh, it's like déjà vu
Boy, if you only knew
This time I messed it up, but I can't give you up
Your face is all I've got
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I know I've always been afraid to say
How I feel, but this's got to change

[Chorus]
Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you
Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue
At your house, number 22

[Post-Chorus]
Number 22, yeah
Baby, where are you?
Number 22

[Bridge]
All alone tonight
Wishing you were laying by my side
So I just keep on driving by
To pass the time

[Chorus]
(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you)
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do) Every time I'm with somebody
And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue
At your house, number 22
[Outro]
(Every time I'm with somebody I'm confusing him with you) Everybody, no, no, no
(Anywhere I go reminds me of the things we used to do) I remember you
(And I dream about the street where we kissed out of the blue) Number 22
(At your house) Number 228
