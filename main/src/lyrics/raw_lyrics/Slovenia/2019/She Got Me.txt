I noticed her when she arrived
Kind of lady that mama like
But mama, she ain't here tonight
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy
When she poured out a little spice
Got the whole place on a vibe
Monday night into Friday night
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy

[Refrain]
She let her body talk
She make the party stop
She gettin' naughty, ya
Droppin' it, droppin' it down

[Pre-Chorus]
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin'
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin', dirty dancin'
You might also like[Chorus]
Dirty dancin'
Dirty dancin'

[Verse 2]
Oh, she lightin' the fire now
We're goin' wild, like an animal
All in, gonna sweat it out
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy
Turnin' heads and turnin' up
Breakin' necks, she breakin' cups
Look at her, can't get enough
Gettin' rowdy, rowdy

[Refrain]
She let her body talk
She make the party stop
She gettin' naughty, ya
Droppin' it, droppin' it down

[Pre-Chorus]
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin'
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin', dirty dancin'
[Chorus]
Dirty dancin'

[Bridge]
All the boys go, yo-yo-yo
All the girls go, yo-yo-yo
Everyone go, yo-yo-yo
She got us dirty dancin'

[Pre-Chorus]
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin'
She got me dirty dancin', dirty dancin'

[Chorus]
Oh, she got me dirty dancin'
Yeah, she got me, got me, got me, dirty dancin'

[Outro]
When she go low, when she go low
She go so low, she go so low
Oh, she know, oh
Oh, she know, she got me dirty dancin', dirty dancin'16
