I'm bluer than the ocean
I'm golden like the rising sun and
I'm red with hot emotion, hmm-hmm, hmm

[Pre-Chorus]
And when they try to hold me down
Inside a box, I'll find my way out
I'm keeping it in motion, hmm-hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
When life brings me trouble, this I know
I never walk away, na-na
Walk away, na-na
We are technicolor, watch us go
We never walk away, na-na
Just stay with me now

[Drop]
Chame-chameleon, chame-chameleon, chame-chameleon
Yeah-la-la-la-la-la-la
Chame-chameleon, chame-chameleon, chame-chameleon
Yeah-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2]
The grass is always greener
When you love me deeper, darling
I can be your jungle, hmm-hmm, hmm
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So when they try to hold me down
Inside a box, I'll find my way out
I'm keeping it in motion, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
When life brings me trouble, this I know
I never walk away, na-na
Walk away, na-na
We are technicolor, watch us go
We never walk away, na-na
Just stay with me now

[Drop]
Chame-chameleon, chame-chameleon, chame-chameleon
Yeah-la-la-la

[Bridge]
Give me water, I'm a swimmer
Give me fire, I'm a fighter
Give me love, I'm your lover
Yeah-la-la-la
Make me cry, I'll be a river
Take my heart, I'll be a giver
I can change like the weather
Yeah-la-la-la
[Chorus]
When life brings me trouble, this I know
I never walk away, na-na
Walk away, na-na
We are technicolor, watch us go
We never walk away, na-na
I never walk away, na-na

[Post-Chorus]
Give me water, I'm a swimmer
Give me fire, I'm a fighter
Give me love, I'm your lover
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
When life brings me trouble, this I know
I never walk away, na-na
I never walk away, na-na
