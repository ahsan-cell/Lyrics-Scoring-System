Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Hey!

[Verse 1]
It’s 72 degrees
Zero chance of rain
It’s been a perfect day
We’re all spinning on our heels
So far away from real
In California-ey-ey
We watched the sunset from our car
We all took it in
And by the time that it was dark
You and me had something, yeah!

[Chorus]
And if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll stay the night
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

We’ve been singing Billie Jean
Mixin’ vodka with caffeine
We’ve got strangers stopping by-y-y
And though you’re out of tune
Girl, you blow my mind, you do
And I’ll say is I don’t wanna say good night
There’s no quiet corner to get to know each other
And there’s no hurry I’m a patient man
As your discover

[Chorus]
'Cause if this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll stay the night
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Just like the song on our radio set
We’ll share the shelter of my single bed
But it’s a different tune that’s stuck in my head
And it goes…
[Chorus]
If this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night
If this is what we’ve got, then what we’ve got is gold
We’re shining bright and I want you, I want you to know
The morning’s on it’s way
Our friends all say goodbye
There’s nowhere else to go
I hope that you’ll stay the night3
