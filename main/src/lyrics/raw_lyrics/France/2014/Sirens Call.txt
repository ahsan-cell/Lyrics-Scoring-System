If I could just see clearly, into you
The same face every day, the sirens calling away
This means so much more

The floating boat is carrying me and I can live my story differently
The greedy sirens chewing all around me while I sing oh, oh...
On the falling shoals, I wonder why me?
On my way to the falls, I hope you see
We are heading to the wall, even if you're sorry
While I sing oh, oh, oh...

In my sleep, nothing same, nothing according to plan
If I could be someone without you
The same smile everyday, the sirens calling away
This means so much more

The floating boat is carrying me and I can live my story differently
The greedy sirens chewing all around me while I sing oh, oh...

And in my sleep, nothing same, nothing according to plan
If I could be someone without you
The same smile everyday, the sirens calling away
This means so much more, this means so much more

The sirens call me... Hou... Hou... Hou...
The floating boat is carrying me and I can live my story differently
While I sing oh...
