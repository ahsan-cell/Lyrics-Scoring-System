You crossed this line
Do you find it hard to sit with me tonight?
I've walked these miles, but I've walked them straight lined
You'll never know what it's like to be
Fine

[Chorus: London Grammar]
And I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if, maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years

[Verse 2: London Grammar]
Don't you know that it's only fear?
And I wouldn't worry, you have all your life
I've heard it takes some time to get it right

[Chorus: London Grammar]
I'm wasting my young years
It doesn't matter if I'm chasing old ideas
It doesn't matter if, maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
Maybe, we are, we are
Maybe I'm wasting my young years
