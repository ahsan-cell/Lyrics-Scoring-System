When I met you
I didn't know what to do. I was tired
I was hungry, I fight
Now I'm away
I write home everyday
And I see you on the TV at night

[Pre-Chorus: Johansson & Yorn]
You can see that life's for us to talk about
You can leave whenever you want out
Whoa

[Chorus: Yorn]
You don't relate to me
No girl
You don't respect me
No girl
No girl. Oh yeah

[Verse 2: Johansson]
When I met you
I didn't know what to do
But I noticed that I didn't really feel
Now you're away
You write home everyday. I don't beg
I don't borrow, I steal

You don't think that life's for us to talk about
You can leave whenever you want out
You want out
Well, you don't relate to me
No girl. You don't respect me
No girl. (you can leave when ever you want out)

[Chorus: Johansson & Yorn]
And you don't relate to me
No girl. And you don't respect me
No girl. (You can leave whenever you want out)
No you don't relate to me
No girl. And you don't respect me
No girl. No girl. Yeah
