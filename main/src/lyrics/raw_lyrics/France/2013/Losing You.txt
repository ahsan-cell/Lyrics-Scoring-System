Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?
We used to kiss all night but now there's just no use
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?

[Verse 1]
I know you're waiting for the words that you can't get from me
Just treat me good and baby I'll give you the rest of me
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?
We used to kiss all night but now there's just no use
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?

[Verse 2]
There's nothing more, I know you're taking it away from me
I gave you everything and now there's nothing left for me
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy
I'm not the one that you should be making your enemy

[Chorus]
Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?
We used to kiss all night but now it's just no use
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?

Tell me the truth, boy, am I losing you for good?
Baby, you know I tried
Can't lose you from my life
We used to kiss all night but now it's just no use
Baby, you know I tried
How could you waste my time?
I don't know why I fight it, clearly we are through
Baby, you know I
Can't lose you from my life
Tell me the truth, boy, am I
Baby, you know I
Losing you for good?22
