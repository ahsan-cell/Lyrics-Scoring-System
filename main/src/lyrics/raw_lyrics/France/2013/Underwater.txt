Bursting through a blood red sky
A slow landslide
And the world we leave behind
It's enough to lose your head
Disappear, and not return again

[Pre-Chorus]
When I fall to my feet
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call
You shot and leaving me raw
Now I know you're amazing

[Chorus]
'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me
And I can live
Underwater, underwater, underwater (Ooh)
Underwater (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Flying through a bright blue sky
With a space boy high
From the world I leave behind
It's enough to lose my head
Disappear, and not be seen again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When I fall to my feet
Wearing my heart on my sleeve
All I see just don't make sense
You are the port of my call
You shot and leaving me raw
Now I know you're amazing

[Chorus]
'Cause all I need
Is the love you breathe
Put your lips on me
And I can live
Underwater, underwater, underwater (Ooh)
(Underwater) Underwater, underwater, I can live underwater
With your love I can breathe, I can breathe underwater
Underwater, underwater
I can live underwater
With your love I can breathe, I can breathe underwater
(Underwater) Underwater, underwater, we could live underwater
With your love I can breathe, I can breathe underwater
(Underwater) Underwater, underwater, we could live underwater
With your love we could breathe, we could breathe
