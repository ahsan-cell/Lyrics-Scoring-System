My life is like a wound
I scratch so I can bleed
Regurgitate my words
I write so I can feed
And death grows like a tree
That's planted in my chest
Its roots are at my feet
I walk so it won't rest

[Chorus]
Oh, baby I am lost
I said, "Oh, baby I am lost"

[Verse 2]
I try to push the colors
Through a prism back to white
To sync our different pulses
Into a blinding light
And if love is not the key
If love is not a key
I hope that I can find
A place where it could be

[Verse 3]
I know that in your heart, there is an answer to a question
Which I'm not as yet aware that I have asked
If that tree had not drunk my tears
I would have bled and cried for all the years
That I alone have let them pass
You might also like[Chorus]
And, oh, baby I am lost
I said, "Oh, baby I am lost"
And, oh, baby I am lost
I said, "Oh, baby I am lost"3
