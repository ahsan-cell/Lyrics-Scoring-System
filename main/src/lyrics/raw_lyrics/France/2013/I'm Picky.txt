I'm Picky

Hey man, it's not gonna work
It has nothing to do with you
I'm sorry, it's me, the thing is : I'm Picky !

[Couplet 1]
I'm Picky and all the girls I drive them crazy
I drive them crazy cos I'm sexy
They call me sexy cos I'm hot, catch my knot
Don't you know I am so hot cos I am picky
And everything is in the lack ?
The lack of me into you, thing makes you scream my name
Honey Holy Hole, that's the goal
To make you wonder why I'm cold and distant
I'm "cold and distant" yes I am
I'm Picky cos I'm all alone
You know that it's crimi, yes it's criminal..

[Refrain]
I'm Picky cos I'm all alone
Maybe I'm alone cos' I'm a picky one
I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call
Another Sunday morning on my own
Maybe I'm too good for you
Or maybe you don't know me cos you know nada
I got a lotta comics to read on the throne
Good looking you and I could get along

Oh Porque, porque siempre dices lo mismo
Lo mismo shiza shy I am, Bim Bam Bam
I fall down and shame again on me
Cos you are laughly with your friends
About my weirdo comportamiento
I'm Picky yo, freaky no dating
Modelo and woman consistent and too persistant
I'm cold and distant
Remember me all the girls I drive'em crazy
I drive'em crazy cos I'm lazy, I don't give a damn
You know I'm fuckin' lazy, I don't give a damn


[Refrain]
I'm Picky cos I'm all alone
Maybe I'm alone cos' I'm a picky one
I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call
Another Sunday morning on my own
Maybe I'm too good for you
Or maybe you don't know me cos you know nada
I got a lotta comics to read on the throne
Good looking you and I could get along

[Outro]
Hey, Hey, Hey..
Hey hey hey..
Talk to me, walk with me, Talk to me, Walk with me
Talk to me, Walk with me, Talk to me you picky !

I'm Picky, I drive them all crazy
I drive them all crazy
You know that i'm HOT, HOT, HOT, HOT


I'm Picky cos' I'm all alone
Oh maybe I'm alone cos I'm a picky one
I got a lotta girls waiting for me not to call
Another Sunday morning on my own
