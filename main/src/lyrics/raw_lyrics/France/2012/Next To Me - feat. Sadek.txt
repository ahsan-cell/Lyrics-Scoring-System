Rolling dice and staying out 'til three
You won't ever find him being unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You won't find him trying to chase the devil
For money, fame, for power, out of grief
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me
When the skies are gray and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
I will find him, I'll find him next to me
When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
Next to me, oh
You will find him, you'll find him next to meYou might also like
