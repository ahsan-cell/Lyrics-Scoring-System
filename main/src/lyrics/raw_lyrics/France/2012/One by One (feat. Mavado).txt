Ladies!
Woah oh, woah oh oh oh
Girl, put your body on me
Woah oh, woah oh oh oh
Yeah!

[Verse 1: Laza Morgan (Mavado)]
Baby girl, you look so good tonight
Good tonight, good tonight
Seeing you dance in the flashing lights
Flashing lights, flashing lights
Dance floor packed full of people (people)
You and I in the middle
And the DJ is playing our favorite songs

[Chorus: Laza Morgan (Mavado)]
One by one
I'm feeling your heartbeat pulling me closer, closer
One by one
With every touch I'm feeling it stronger, stronger
One by one
I believe you and me, we're falling in love
'Cause all the faces are fading around us
One by one
Woah oh, woah oh oh oh
One by one
Woah oh, woah oh oh oh
Girl, put your body on me!
