Stop where the sign
Hollywood skyline
Mulholland drive
If you gonna ride by
Stop where the sign
Hollywood skyline
Mulholland drive
Up this planet then you'll see
Six-feet beneath
Our energy fleets
Oh ye we
And your love is so sweet
Get a hold on me
Same crew we kickin'
Can't trust them motives
I don't want nobody (no one else but you)
Just another night here
Something to believe in
Harder to be free (when you look me)You might also like
