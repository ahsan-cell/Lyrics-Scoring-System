For now I wouldn't mind with just living in the back of your mind
You know I'll think of you when I lay my head down tonight
And I couldn't talk 'bout forever, but ever is here and now
This time won't leave the city, still big time dreaming
With a couple of friends got my back
Feelings come and go
And we might not be our last
But you know for you (you know, you know)
I'd cry, with a thousand eyes (thousand eyes, thousand eyes)
Like tonight
Such a beautiful city, when you're right here with me
And I couldn't talk bout forever, but evеr is here and now
So sad so sad you're lеaving leaving leaving
