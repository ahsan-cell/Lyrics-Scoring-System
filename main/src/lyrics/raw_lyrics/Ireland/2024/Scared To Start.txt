She's wearing an old dress, walking it out
Waiting for someone to turn her around
But she won't believe you
When you fall down on your knees
She fell asleep listening to my friends
Talking on and on about how the world ends
Then she wakes up
And climbs in my front seat

[Chorus]
And she said
"Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?"

[Verse 2]
Let's lay in the dead grass, stare at the stars
Run away and live out of cars and bars
Let's just leave here
'Cause there's nothing left to see
And if that's wrong, let's make it right
And if you leave, just give me one more night
'Cause there's no one
That you'll find that's quite like me
You might also like[Chorus]
And she said
"Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Are you scared to start?"

[Bridge]
You don't need the paycheck, don't need the rent
You can take it all 'cause it's already spent
We can burn out, just as long as we burn bright

[Chorus]
And she said
"Don't you wait to try it
Are you scared to find it?
And do you wanna take my broken heart?
Will you ever heal from all these scars?
Did you ever take it all so far?
Are you scared to start?"
