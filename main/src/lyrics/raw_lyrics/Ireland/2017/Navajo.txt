[Pre-Chorus]
I know you see it, girl
This ain't sittin' real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle, ah
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

[Chorus]
I thought she was an Indian (Navajo)
She be slangin’ thangs like a simian (Now I know), uh
All my life I wanted me an Indian (There she goes)
Now she’s far away
But I had to know

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen, I know you see it, girl
This ain't sittin' real good in my soul
Everywhere this little girl goes
She pick up another obstacle, ah
She was my heart
I don't know the tribe or the fall
But by default she don't think of me

I thought she was an Indian, woo (Navajo)
Now she be slangin’ thangs like a simian (Now I know)
All my life I wanted me an Indian (There she goes)
Ooo girl lemme in (Oh-oh)

[Verse]
In the street
With a wedding ring
And she hit the bar
City babe, are you down to cheat?
He looked in her eye
Chivalry is it really dead?
He pulled out a tip? (Pay up)
Jumpin’ right on him
Thinkin’ when’s it good to intervene
Then I lost her
Lost her to the world and the girls and impostors
Entertain? I doubt it'll pay and it cost her
I ain't mad at me but it hurts

[Chorus]
And I thought she was an Indian (Navajo), uh
Now she only worried 'bout the Benjamin’s, eh, ah (Grab the gold)
She been lurking’ in my dreams (There she goes)
I swear that eye's on me
And now she goes
[Post-Chorus]
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me
I swear that eye's on me

[Outro]
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean33
