Go back, I want
So bad to hold you back
It’s all I've said and done
Fall in, be gone
I will stand, as I've won again
The reason for no more
Overnight

[Chorus]
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight

[Verse 2]
Slow down, never
I know now, I know better
I need it more than ever
Go back under
Hope that I fall on the track
It’s all I've said and done
Overnight

The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight
It’s overnight
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing
The minute I was thinking to hold you back
The moment I was wishing, it’s overnight10
