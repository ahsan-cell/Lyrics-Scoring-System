Tonight with me
Tonight with me

[Verse 1]
There's mountains on Mars and riverbeds too
Infinite stars and there's me and you
There's nothing needs doing, just keep on moving
And be here now with me
Won't you be here now with me?

[Pre-Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance, let it be, be, be
Dance all over me
C'mon and dance, dance, dance, let it be, be, be
Dance all over me

[Chorus]
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?

[Post-Chorus]
Cut it up and dance all over me
Cut it up and dance all over me

If you walk through the desert and fall to your knees
You're perfectly sick, you got that mover's disease
It's a one-stop shop for that hot sweat drop
And be here now with me
Won't you be here now with me?

[Chorus]
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?

[Post-Chorus]
Cut it up and dance all over me
Cut it up and dance all over me

[Bridge]
Dance, dance, dance, let it be, be, be
Dance all over me
C'mon and dance, dance, dance, let it be, be, be
Dance all over me

[Chorus]
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?
Tonight with me, tonight with me
Won't you cut it up and dance all over me?1
