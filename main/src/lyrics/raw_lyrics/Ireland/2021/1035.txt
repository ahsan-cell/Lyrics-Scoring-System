All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let ’em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thankin’, thankin' God you found me
That you found me

[Verse 1]
Every day, I go places in my head
Darker thoughts are harder now
They look like monsters under my bed
And every time, it's like a rocket through my chest
The TV make you think the whole world's about to end

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know where this night is goin' (Goin')
But I know that you and me got somethin' (Somethin’)
So many things that I’m afraid of (I'm afraid of)
But right now, I ain’t scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know it's, ’cause all I know it's, all I, all I)

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thankin', thankin' God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry, just pass the bottle
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me

Every night, I go places in my dreams
So many never-endin' alleyways
I don't know what it means
But this is it, I know the sun'll wake me up
Tell me I'd be dumb to not get what I want

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know where this night is goin'
But I know that you and me got somethin'
So many things that I'm afraid of
But right now, I ain't scared of nothin'
('Cause all I know it's, all I, all I)

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me
All I know it's 10:35
And I'm thankin', thankin' God you found me
That you found me
So don't you worry about tomorrow
Don't you worry (Yeah), just pass the bottle (Oh)
All I know it's 10:35
And I can feel your arms around me
Let 'em drown me (Oh-oh, oh)
[Outro]
It's 10:35, oh-ooh
10:35, oh-oh-oh
Know it's 10:35, oh-oh-oh
Know it's 10:35, oh-oh-oh34
