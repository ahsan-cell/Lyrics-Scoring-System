As I’m getting older, chip up on my shoulder
Rolling through life, to roll over and die
[Scat Singing]
Missing Hippie Jon, salad days are gone
Remembering things just to tell ‘em so long
[Scat Singing]

[Chorus]
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year

[Verse 2]
Always feeling tired, smiling when required
Write another year off and kindly resign
[Scat Singing]
Salad days are gone, missing Hippie Jon
Remember the days just to tell ‘em so long
[Scat Singing]

[Chorus]
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another year
Oh mama, actin’ like my life’s already over
Oh dear, act your age and try another yearYou might also like33
