I've been tryin' to keep my grip
Yeah, I think I'm over this
I can hear it now, oh no, oh no-o
Yeah, my tongue will let it slip
Why'd I do those things I did?
I can taste it now, oh no, oh no-o

[Chorus]
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss

[Verse 2]
My innards turn, your eyes, they roll
I'll be there to take the fall
I can feel it now, oh no, oh no-o
Same old story since day one
But I've got no place to run
I can see it now, oh no, oh no-o

[Chorus]
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss
You might also like[Bridge]
(Oh, woah)
High voltage in her lips, they catch me when I slip
(Oh, woah)
High voltage in her lips, they catch me when I slip

[Chorus]
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss

[Outro]
(Oh, woah)
(Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips)
(Oh, woah)
(Like cardiac arrest, high voltage when we kiss)
I'll try my best, how much do I invest?
Like cardiac arrest, high voltage in her lips, I'll try my bestâ€¦30
