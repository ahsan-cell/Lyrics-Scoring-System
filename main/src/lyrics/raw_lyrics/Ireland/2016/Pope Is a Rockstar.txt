Now he wants to start talking
"Go ahead," when I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
"No, don't wanna, won't happen"

[Chorus]
Pope is a rockstar
You take your clothes off
Heading for the last fight
Before our worlds part

[Verse 2]
We can wait forever for the world to untrack
We can wait forever for the worthwhile track
And, oh, you want to start talking
Fall together, I'm walking
Face the lie that I'm hawking
We can always fight

[Bridge]
You can be the highlight
Pope is a rockstar
Hoping on a late night

[Verse 3]
How you wanna start talking?
How you wanna start walking?
We can make a landslide, dive-in
We can let it all go, cave-in
You wanna start talking
You know what I'm walking
Hoping that I— hoping that I won't cry
Hoping that I— hoping that I won't tryYou might also like12
