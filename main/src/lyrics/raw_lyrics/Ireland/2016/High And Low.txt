Now we are running in a pack to the place you don't know
And I want you to know that I'll always be around
Down where the summer and the late nights last forever
There's a house on the hill and we can't travel now

[Pre-Chorus]
Alice D, you're on your way up
Way up
Way up

[Chorus]
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go)

[Verse 2]
Let's get together and forget all the troubles and just float
I don't want you to go
I need to be closer to now

[Pre-Chorus]
Alice D, you're on your way up
Way up
Way up

I feel both sides, babe, high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go)

[Bridge]
Alice D is on her way home
She's been out all night again
She don't want nobody's help now
She sees stars and rocket ships

[Chorus]
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe, high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe (I feel both sides, babe), high and low (High and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (Never let you go, never let you go)
I feel both sides, babe3
