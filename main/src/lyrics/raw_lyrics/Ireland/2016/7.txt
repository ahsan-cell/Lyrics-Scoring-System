Larry, call a load of smoke in, I wanna lose a couple days
We've probably never struggled coping, but I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though, but I always want to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

[Chorus]
And I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

[Verse 2]
Larry, call a load of smoke in, I wanna disappear for days
We've probably never struggled sleeping, but I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though, but I always want to

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through
I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another second to myself
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close

[Chorus]
(I don't think through things, I never get time)
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
('Cause I don't think things through)
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
(I don't think through things, I never get time)
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
('Cause I don't think things through)
But I never come close21
