She sold her love to a modern man
Good solid currencyâ€™s the hardest to land
All of that money helps you cover your ass
Don't let the ladyfinger blow in your hands

[Chorus]
Did it all, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 2]
Just like a whiskey bottle drained on the floor
She got no future, just a life to endure
This good samaritan is shaking her hand
Too late to leave here now, the songs in the can

[Chorus]
Give it up, for that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Verse 3]
You call it chivalry
Never pull a punch for free
You ever wonder why they had to move on
This phony honor code
That put you on your throne
A double-standard you invoke when you want
You might also like[Chorus]
For that dollar
She's a star tonight
Without warning
She gave up the ghost inside

[Bridge]
Was it all for show?
Don't turn into one of them
Turning another page
Trust me darling
I'm carving a moat through the dust in your town
Crawling over the rubble
Just to serve you
Tend to wonder why

[Chorus - Instrumental]12
