[Verse 1]
Hello again
Friend of a friend, I knew you when
Our common goal was waiting for the world to end

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up, every time
Everyone, ooh, ooh
Pulls away, ooh, ooh
From you

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Got balls of steel
Got an automobile for a minimum wage
Got real estate, I'm buying it all up in outer space

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that the truth is just a rule that you can bend
You crack the whip, shape-shift and trick, the past again

[Chorus]
I'll send you my love on a wire
Lift you up, every time
Everyone, ooh, ooh
Pulls away, ooh, ooh
It's a mechanical bull, the number one
You'll take a ride from anyone
Everyone wants a ride
Pulls away, ooh, ooh
From you
[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh29
