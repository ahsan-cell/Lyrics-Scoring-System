Down by the river by the boats
Where everybody goes to be alone
Where you won't see any rising sun
Down to the river we will run

[Verse 2]
When by the water we drink to the dregs
Look at the stones on the river bed
I can tell from your eyes
You've never been by the riverside

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Down by the water the riverbed
Somebody calls you somebody says
Swim with the current and float away
Down by the river everyday

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

[Verse 3]
When that old river runs past your eyes
To wash off the dirt on the riverside
Go to the water so very near
The river will be your eyes and ears
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I walk to the borders on my own
To fall in the water just like a stone
Chilled to the marrow in them bones
Why do I go here all alone

[Chorus]
Oh my God, I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

[Chorus]
Oh my God I see how everything is torn in the river deep
And I don't know why I go the way
Down by the riverside

[Outro]
Down by the riverside
Down by the riverside10
