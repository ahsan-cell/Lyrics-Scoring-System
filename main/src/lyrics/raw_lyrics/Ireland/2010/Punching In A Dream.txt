All the lights go down
As I crawl into the spaces
Fight, flight, or the screams
Life tearing at the seams

[Chorus]
Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
If it falls apart
I will surely wake it
Bright lights turn me green
This is worse than it seems
You might also like[Chorus]
Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
They'll get through, they'll get you
In the place that you fear it the most
In the corner, where it's warmer
In the face that you wish was a ghost
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
[Chorus]
Wait
I don't ever want to be here
Like punching in a dream
Breathing life into my nightmare

[Outro]
Wait (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't ever want to be here (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Like punching in a dream (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
Breathing life into my nightmare (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)11
