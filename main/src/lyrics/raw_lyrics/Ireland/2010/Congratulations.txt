Dead in the water, it's not a paid vacation
The sons and daughters of city officials attend demonstrations
It's hardly a sink or swim when all is well if the ticket sells

[Verse 2]
Out with a whimper, it's not a blaze of glory
You look down from your temple as people endeavor to make it a story
And chisel a marble word, but all is lost if it's never heard

[Chorus 1]
But I've got someone to make reports that tell me how my money's spent
To book my stays and draw my blinds so I can't tell what's really there
And all I need's a great big congratulations

[Verse 3]
I'll keep your dreams, you pay attention for me
As strange as it seems, I'd rather dissolve than have you ignore me
The ground may be moving fast but I tied my boots to a broken mast

[Verse 4]
The difference is clear, you throw it in your cauldron
Rust and veneer, dusk and dawn, Steinways and Baldwins
You start with a simple stock of all the waste and salt to taste

[Chorus 2]
But damn myï»¿ luck and damn these friends that keep on combing back their smiles
I save my grace with half-assed guilt and lay down the quilt upon the lawn
Spread my arms and soak up congratulationsYou might also like6
