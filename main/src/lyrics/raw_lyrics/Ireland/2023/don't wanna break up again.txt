Mm

[Verse 1]
I fall asleep cryin'
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby

[Verse 2]
I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again)

[Bridge]
We both know it's time
So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly of our little life

[Chorus]
I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby
[Outro]
(Hah, hah, hah)
(Hah, hah, hah)
Don't wanna break up again (Breakin' my heart)
I don't wanna, baby
Situationship has to end (Know it has to end)
Just can't refuse
Ooh1
