How can it be? You and me
Might be meant to be, can't unsee it
But I don't wanna cause no scene
I'm usually so unproblematic
So independent, tell me why
'Cause the boy is mine, mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
Thе boy is mine
Watch me take my timе
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine

[Verse 2]
Please know this ain't what I planned for
Probably wouldn't bet a dime or my life on
There's gotta be a reason why
My girls, they always come through in a sticky situation
Say, "It's fine" (It's fine)
Happens all the time
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Somethin' about him is made for somebody like me
Baby, come over, come over (Over)
And God knows I'm tryin', but there's just no use in denying

[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is—

[Bridge]
And I know it's simply meant to be
And I, I take full accountability for all these tears
Promise you, I'm not usually like this
Shit, it's like news to me, to me
But I can't ignore my heart, boy

[Chorus]
The boy is mine
I can't wait to try him (Oh, yeah)
Le-let's get intertwined
The stars, they aligned
The boy is mine
Watch me take my time
I can't believe my mind
The boy is divine
Boy is mine9
