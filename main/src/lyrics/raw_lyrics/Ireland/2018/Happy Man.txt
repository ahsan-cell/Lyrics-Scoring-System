I'm a troubled man, changed by the things I do
True, but it's funny how they all remember you
It all could be different, time to do something new
Giving everything, oh, to be a happy man too
Gotta understand, blamed by the friends I lose
Who's getting out of hand? Do you think they depend on you?
It all could be different, try to do something new
Giving everything, oh, to be a happy man too

[Chorus]
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing

[Verse 2]
Gonna run it 'round, strange, but it just won't do
Know when it's coming down, taking a hold on you
It all could be different, try to do something new
Giving everything, oh, to be a happy man too

[Chorus]
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing

Closer
Telling it over
It all could be different, it's time to do something new
(Closer)
Giving everything, oh, to be a happy man too
(Over)

[Chorus]
Buy yourself a dream, how's it looking?
Buy yourself a car and a house to live in
Get yourself a girl, someone different
Buy yourself a dream and it won't mean nothing

[Outro]
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on
No, I won't let it tame or twist me
I just got told that I gotta move on8
