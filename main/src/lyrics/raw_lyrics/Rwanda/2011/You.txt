[Chorus: Kanda]
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
'Cause love always comes to my mind when I think about you
Aye
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
Just one call away, I no dey lie, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there for you)

[Verse 1: GEOGRAPHY MeNd$]
Tell me, are you liking how I'm moving?
You're liking all vibes to the music?
Wanna ride? Then, let's do it
Lose our minds, go stupid
Fly like a cupid
Our time, it goes booming
Right now, just gotta move it, oh
This world's not much longer
Just wanna put your lifetime on quadra
The ladies see mе and be acting like, "Uh-uh"
But it's alright 'cause right now, I'm just 'bout to turn up, yo
Yuh just haffi еase yuh mind, plus yuh attitude
Mek yuh twist it ow yuh should, wah mi sey tuh duh
Ave a likkle feeling dat yuh cud become mi boo
Kinda sounding like a fool
I just wish to keep it cool
You might also like[Refrain: GEOGRAPHY MeNd$]
There's no one around to kill the fun
Di hottest gyal dancing through di sun
Got nothing but fire to my drum
Got nothing but fire on the run

[Chorus: Kanda]
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
'Cause love always comes to my mind when I think about you
Aye
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
Just one call away, I no dey lie, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there for you)

[Verse 2: GEOGRAPHY MeNd$]
Look what you started
Mi haffi long time go retarded
You always see me near the ocean just swerving
But I'll kick it with you, no matter who's lurking, oh
Party's at the top, show me all your skills (All your skills)
Look just like a girl worth a hundred bills (Hundred bills)
Always dance like no one's watching, it just gives me chills
Thinking if it's something real
I just don't know what to feel
We ought-a get a hundred bands for the runner up
I always like to break it down until the sun is up
And that doofus who did you wrong is always talking tough
Acting like he's out here running stuff
Gon' F around and call his father up
[Refrain: GEOGRAPHY MeNd$]
There's no one around to kill the fun
Di hottest gyal dancing through di sun
Got nothing but fire to my drum
Got nothing but fire on the run

[Chorus: Kanda & Jazzy Rhodes]
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
'Cause love always comes to my mind when I think about you
Aye
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
Just one call away, I no dey lie, I'll be there for you (Kitoko Sound)
(I'll be there for you)
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
'Cause love always comes to my mind when I think about you
Aye
Would you be my princess?
(Princess)
Just one call away, I no dey lie, I'll be there for you
(I'll be there for you)
