[Chorus: 5Much]
I love the life I live, we go tit for tat
Opposition sendin' shots, they get hit for that
They stupid if they blitz, we got sticks for that
I was taught to keep it active, well, I did that
Catch a nigga lackin', put his shit back
Body bag, toe tag and I'm with that
Catch a nigga lackin', put his shit back
Body bag, toe tag and I'm with that
I love the life I live, we go tit for tat
Opposition sendin' shots, they get hit for that

Body bag, toe tag and I'm with that

Body bag, toe tag and I'm with that (Look)

Comin' from the bottom to the top, I swear the shit a blessin'
Read the message, leavе her ass on seen, then delеte the message
Beat the bitch and then I gotta leave before I catch domestic

I'm a gangster, lil' baby, I keep a gleeky with extension
It's the hood, ask about us, we them niggas bringin' tension
I ain't never turned down a fade, did I mention?
It's some molly in my system so my jaw probably clenchin'
Dude just a poodle, Sleazeball the big dog, aye
Run into me in the mall and catch paws
Nigga, what it is? I ain't finna keep talkin'
Big nickel on my hip, this bitch barkin'
Do the race, interstate, I'm lane changin'
Feds tryna lock me down for gangbangin'
On probation, keep a meat, I ain't changin'
All I know is 200, stay dangerous
Keep it on my side, on granny, I can't lie

You come and fuck with us, you fuckin' with mob ties
If I ever make it out, I might cry

No smut, no cut with the biggest face tats
Long live Tiny Madd in that [?][3:30] red flag
Gon' slide through the phonies, [?][3:32]
Big strap, ski mask, twenty racks, I'm on they ass
Brass came, did the dash and threw the strap up in the stash
Double back for Nightmare, tape someone if he flat
Double back for Nightmare, tape someone if he flat
The forty got a stick, the four-five came with a flashlight
Ski mask, gloves in my pocket, they don't play fair
Double back and body bagged his ass, ain't no daycare
Double back and body bagged his ass, ain't no daycare
I'm steppin' in these Louis, but tomorrow I got Christian Loubs
Prada, V, Bape backpack with the Christian Loubs
This forty got a stick, that bulldog'll put a hole in him
I seen 'em throw that white sheet on, he was over with
