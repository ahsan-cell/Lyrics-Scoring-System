[Verse 1: Illusion Z]
The schizophrenic with a crystal ball looks for Pac
On the butcher’s block
Where an eyepatched gremlin pushes rock
Cravin’ Old Rip Van Winkle, Juniper Green
The Polar Ice, Havana Club, the jungle juice and the lean
Bulgy eyed aerosol inhalers dream of boarding starbases
In dark places with incarcarated scarfaces
Town martian with a drinking problem roaming around starvin
Screams at passersby
Hallucinating 3000 pound marlin
Three killers bumping barrington levy
Walk through the madness
Carrying chevy sized weapons that could bury a yeti
Craving foreign Glocks apparel and dexedrine
Thinking of robbin barrels of methylamine
And poppin’ cherries in tel aviv
Ice blazers in pajamas run through night mazes
From a lime flavored vodka bottle the size of a skyscraper
The tweeker in a shed thinks he’s larry hoover
In a lair of shooters
Grippin’ rugers and barricudas
Rocking back and forth
Starin through the hole in the wood
At shadow people trying to steal his lucky charms and his buried buddha
The shot out bitch with a buzz cut in a snake and racoon blood painted toga
Yells at law enforcement in a rage on somas
Bandana’d bag of bones playing gangster like ray liotta
Sips his eighth corona
Fantasizing of pushing caine like sosa
On a throne built of franklin stacks
Praying that he’ll live like a baller
With a machete and a fistful of dollars
Boy scout turned dopesick animal
Throws alcohol fits
And drinks his gasoline like aperol spritz
Scabfaced bandit tells a street pirate in a red crown
The monkeys off his back but the circus hasnt left town
A one eyed looney stares at static on an idiot box
In a padded chamber with a red door with seventy locks
Salivating at the thought of running through a meadow of yellow Flowers with a gun
Saturn devouring his sun
On the wall
A group of twitching bodybuilders watch forensic files
Sharpening their swords to give the pedophiles second smiles
Two veterans fill up their heroine needles
Minds as twisted as tarantino’s
Quoting scenes out of cinema paradiso
In a city breathing with bullet trains
Shaven chewbaccas with kryptonite cooking veins
Roaring after crooked rains
Where raiders in presidential masks kidnapped its hero
And broadcasted his execution live on channel zero

[Verse 2: RANDOM]
I wrote this on adderall and weed, water and oxygen
Man in the machine just part of my processin
We play a game of life it’s harder than not to win
Climbin back from the fall to start at the top again
Cold and frozen peak where it never gets warmer
And anymore I just tend to ignore the weather reporter
An oasis of horror in a desert of boredom
So we get high to pass the time and wait around to the finish
Turnin hours to minutes
Always too proud to admit it
Til I started coming down with altitude sickness
It’s gettin too difficult to fit in the box
Easier to visit the doc
And give me a shot
To fix what I got
Instead of standin stranded, set atop a hill
Of debt and doctor bills
This modern medicine went and got us ill
Didn’t have a father figure but they get a poppa pill
Just sumn to numb the ache of another dumb mistake
Like, what’s it gonna take
I’m feelin done with this shit
And this hunger exists in hundreds of kids
Younger than this
Drunk on a fifth
Sleepin out shootin up under a bridge
Worn down by the grindstone of life
In the dark, dark corners where the mind goes at night
Lyin on a bed of needles not a pinecone in sight
If money’s the root of all evil then the powers that be are the flowers and leaves that sour the breeze
Cowards and thieves
Convinced the crowd to believe
Their great-grandmother Eve stole the fruit out of their trees
And this way’s been paved in graves of thousands enshrouded in granite
Lives lost buried down in the planet
Tryna make the most of the little amount that you’re handed
But what's the value of talent and status
When we already lost Alex Buchanan
So how do you manage this grief as it’s comin out
In need of another route
Just weep for this mother’s child
Like Beasts of the Southern Wild
It’s gettin harder to absorb it
Need us all to be supportive
But all we get is warnings
That we’re already ignorin
An apology’s in order
So I wrote a couple verses for what’s always been important
You just take two of these and call me in the morning
Rehab Journal Entry
[Verse 3: Illusion Z]
The scientist who
Drank voodoo rangers til he wound up in a cuckoo chamber
For screaming that he wanted to shoot his neighbors
Told us all at breakfast that administration
Cancelled group
After the wetbrain went in the main hall and splattered poop all over the floor
A drummer that’d been locked up in Reno
Complained about the toothless hawaiian chef’s broccoli burritos
Soy bean olive casseroles, vegan cheese empanadas
And sweet and sour chicken dish as chinese as maracas
A Brazilian freak in pajamas with teeth like Baraka
Who’d speak like Obama
Said he had a seizure at Jamba Juice
The same night he got 86’d from McD’s and Carrabbas
A surfer who spent his adolescence sleeping in plazas
Said he spent his twenties dry in a desert dreaming of llamas
In his enemies’ mouths
Of smoking blueberry on that “Red” beach in Caracas
Of bikinied mulattas serving him pina coladas feeding him guavas
A beat up Moana
Faced hooker craving needle and kava
Told me she made her sponsor eat her palabras
Said the fatherfucker told her the 4th step would wipe out all of her demons and dramas
She laughed and said Mr. Brown had made her people piranhas
A tweeked out madonna
In torn oil stained jeans, a Nirvana shirt
A Trump hat
With meth breath she couldn’t beat with binaca
Screamed “I’m ready to erupt”
Her blood feeling like lava
Threatened the therapist and promised she would steal his impala
A Manson clone with handlebar mustache and silver nails
Who’d steal change out of the wishing wells to cop zinfandel
Said theres a pit in hell for 13th steppers who play yoda
An old starlet on the patio chain smoked her Virginia Slims
Whining that she wouldn't have luck if it rained clovers
That her husband had an ego the size of a range rover
A tweeker who put in more work for the roc than jay hova
Said when that ether of a drug would take over
Her mouth was a flamethrower
A copper thief who downed cabernet copa de vinos til they tasted like grape sodas and ate somas like flinstones
Til he wound up in a 70 day coma
Told me why he worshipped the needle how it made his veins colder
While i drank kona listening to Daytona on a coffee stained sofa in a stale odored meeting room staring down a fake Mona Lisa on the wall where our counselor wrote how many days sober we had with a crayola
Hope
[Verse 4: RANDOM]
There’s many paths to life I don’t know which one to travel
And I’m not one of those though who chose to hold the judge’s gavel
It’s a long and stony road alone the soldiers trudge to battle
Til our weary souls erode and the boulders crushed to gravel
If we don’t speak up our silence approves
So heres to the things I didn’t do
Poems in his head tryna get through
Though their noses are red, eyelids are blue
This graveyard’s quiet on the midnight shift
You can wear a brave face while your inside’s sick
But what makes you stronger doesn’t kill you bit by bit
Drip by drip just one too many bourbons
Nobody was ever perfect of that I’m plenty certain
Life’s rough for every person
Light blunts for heavy burdens
And most the saints’re dead
So go’n raise your head
But no sleep before you made your bed
It’s ok to make amends just wait and save your breath
We need that strength to take the steps
Along this razor’s edge
Go on place your bets
Just know to pay respects
This life takes a toll that fate collects
And the soul’s the only payment they accept
Too many nameless victims
We coulda gave forgiveness
Never too late to save the sinners
Whose brain’s chained away in prisons
Bein brave to face addictions
That’re makin they decisions
I miss the people from my past who didn’t make it this far
And I won’t say who they are
But if they’d raised an alarm
I’d’ve been there to help em not be so afraid of the dark
Just tryna see my sunrise/son rise before the day began
It takes a village to raise a child and a world to make a man
See the pain in the lesson
But praise the progression
Still learnin how to face the depression
It’s up to us to start changin the methods
And see the difference between shame and acceptance
It’s cliche but simple, remember
We’re in this together whether for business or pleasure never diminished the effort
Of anyone of us who didn’t give in to pressure
Even those that did...still deservin compassion
Build the world you imagine
It ain’t perfect but it’s worth it for the purpose of magic
For me it’s enough reason to live
Daydreamer wasn't sleeping a bit
The fact we even exist should be seen as a gift
Life comes with pain we don’t need to resist
My mistakes made me who I am still too proud to hide
So pour out an ounce of pride
Nobody makes it out alive
But if I keep pushin then maybe I’ll survive
