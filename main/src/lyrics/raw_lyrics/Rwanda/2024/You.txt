7:00 am, I'm gonna miss my bus
My clothes are all missed matched
And kind of wrinkled up
(Yeah)
I forgot to charge my phone and I just gotta trust it'll be okay
And nothing else will get up in my way
But look at my luck, look at my luck
(Yeah)
Cause I forgot my necklace, my breakfast, my homework, and wallet
I don't know how I'm even gonna make it into college
I hope that maybe one day I will learn to learn my lesson
For now I'm gonna check my phone and reread all our messages

[Pre-Chorus 1]
(Yeah) cause you make me feel better I hope that someday
I will step up and give you the letter
I wrote inside my closet at 3:00 am saying how I really feel
I just wanna be your man

[Chorus 1]
Cause nothing ever matters if I can't have you
Oh, when I hear your voice
I end up dancing in my room
Got me praying to the stars
That we never ever part
Cause, nothing ever matters if I can't, if I can't have you

Half past 3 and I'm just tryna relax
I gotta take things slow
I'm moving away too fast (yeah, yeah)
So I'll put up my feet
Sleep, eat, and repeat
Cause time never stops
It's all up to me
But my mind keeps racing
My thoughts I be chasing
I can't seen to be clear it
I wanna be care free

Cause, I feel asleep in chemistry
And woke up in economics
I don't how I got there
If I'm being honest
But that don't really matter
Cause, I'm gonna see you later
You know you speak my language
We don't need a translator

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But I'm tryna be with you
I don't care just what we do
You're my world, my sun, and moon
Oh, my love goes through the roof because
[Chorus 2]
Nothing ever matters if I can't have you
Oh, when I hear your voice
I end up dancing in my room
Got me praying to the stars
That we never ever part

Cause, nothing ever matters if I can't, if I can't have you
Nothing ever matters
If I can't have you
Oh, when I hear your voice I end up dancing in my room
Got me praying to the stars
That we never ever part
Cause, nothing ever matters if I can't
If I can't have you
