[Chorus: PJ]
Can't fuck with me when I'm in my element
Every day, man, I been hustlin'
Askin' real niggas where the fuck they been
Ladies, do you feel me? Like show you're right
Don't fuck with me when I'm in my element (Element)
Every day, man, I been hustlin' (Hustlin')
Smiling for the times that I been strugglin' (Strugglin')
Ladies, do you feel me? Like show you're right

[Verse 1: PJ]
Come in, do you copy? Proper or with Ebonics
Any y'all got a problem with me, it's now not my problem
This my jimmy-jam, this that stupid flow, drippin', super-soaked
Super cool, but I could sugar coat, but that'd be stupid though
Niggas outta pocket, women sellin' they pussy
Niggas is wifin' hoes, I'm sorry, don't introduce me
Keep it pimpin' though, on your tippy-toes, you don't hear me though
If you're thirsty, there's that alkaline, ho, what you sippin' on?

[Chorus: PJ]
Can't fuck with me when I'm in my element (Element)
Every day, man, I been hustlin' (Hustlin')
Askin' real niggas where the fuck they been (Where they been?)
Ladies, do you feel me? Like show you're right
Can't fuck with me when I'm in my element (Element)
Every day, man, I been hustlin' (Hustlin')
Smiling for the times that I been strugglin' (Strugglin')
Ladies, do you feel me? Like show you're right (Show)

Ain't no pressure, even when I get fed up
I keep my head up, only time can make it better (Better)
I just give 'em a taste of they medicine
I'm a gift from above, bitch, I'm Heaven sent
I won't give the pu-nanny, I'm celibate
You can't fuck with me, I'm in my element
I'm a problem, so it's hard to just get rid of me (Me)
Now they feenin' for it, but they don't got the remedy (Remedy)
Remember I was strugglin', but they didn't show no sympathy (Sympathy)
I know you hate it, bet you wish you kept it real with me (Real with me)

[Verse 3: PJ]
I got plenty problems, but stoppin' just ain't an option
Niggas think talkin' 'bout me could really impede the progress
They can have it though, they can super choke, I been super broke
Don't need your opinions like you're smart, but you're just stupid, woah
I'ma crash with the bass, a sex symbol
Fraudulent niggas just can't keep up with the tempo
Man, how I do it like the Juice, I keep it simple
Let me just talk my shit, let me shut it down real quick
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Chorus: PJ]
Can't fuck with me when I'm in my element (Element)

Askin' real niggas where the fuck they been (Where they been?)
Ladies, do you feel me? Like show you're right
Can't fuck with me when I'm in my element (Element)
Every day, man, I been hustlin' (Hustlin')
Smilin' for the times that I been strugglin' (Strugglin')
Ladies, do you feel me? Like show you're right
