So we've had an email from Sam who says, "I broke up with my girlfriend last Christmas, now I can't face Christmas and I'm thinking about her all the time"
Oh, I hear about so many relationships at Christmas time that end up making just like the turkey and being completely stuffed

[Verse 1]
Get out of my lonely bed in the morning
The radio's all about global warming
Rain is pelting down the street
It's beginning to sound a lot like
Christmas time (Christmas time, Christmas time)

[Verse 2]
Been nearly a year but I keep hearing your voice now
Hate silent nights but I have no choice now
Light the fire, mull the wine
I'll down a few to forget about
Christmas time (Christmas time, Christmas time)

[Pre-Chorus]
So how am I s'posed to move on and forget
'Cos all I want for Christmas is
Inside my head

[Chorus]
So turn off the carols, unjingle the bells
Let's boil the chestnuts in stew
Don't light any fireworks, it hurts like hell
'Cos Christmas reminds me of you
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
The sounds of Christmas
Remind me of you

'Spoken word section two'
Ah, I love the spoken word section
Shut up Margaret

[Verse 3]
Children laughing and playing, nice
The thud of your body on slippery ice
Santa ho'ing every corner
Ooh! It's Christmas time
It's Christmas time (Christmas time, Christmas time)

[Pre-Chorus]
So how am I s'posed to move on and forget
'Cos last Christmas is still
Inside my head

[Chorus]
So turn off the carols, unjingle the bells
Let's boil the chestnuts in stew
Don't light any fireworks, it hurts like hell
'Cos Christmas reminds me of you
[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
The sounds of Christmas
Remind me of you

Christmas always reminds me of you
And by 'you', I mean 'beef'

[Chorus]
So turn off the carols, unjingle the bells
Let's boil the chestnuts in stew
Don't light any fireworks, it hurts like hell
'Cos Christmas reminds me of you (reminds me of you)

[Chorus]
So turn off the carols, unjingle the bells (reminds me of you)
Let's boil the chestnuts in stew (reminds me of you)
Don't light any fireworks, it hurts like hell (reminds me of you)
'Cos Christmas reminds me of you (reminds me of you)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh
The sounds of Christmas
Remind me of you
