We were once happy together
Far from the city
Our goals were set together
Gave name to our daughter
I had a dream
Of growing old with you Iyooh
I cannot believe you left me here
Pregnant you said you are
Satisfied you said you are
Money you said you have
But No No No No oh yeah

Many girls were crazy for me
But I left them for you
You remember
I loved to drink beer
But I left it all for you

For you to comeback
And forget everything
Many girls were crazy for me
But I left them for you
You remember
I loved to drink beer
But I left all for you
