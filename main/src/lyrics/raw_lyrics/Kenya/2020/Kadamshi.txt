Yeah, yeah, Mega Ran, knock knock, open up, Mega Ran is up and I'm going nuts
Rowdy like the dude who hit superfly with the coconut
Gameboy say he need me, told him say less
You won't get no respawn, unless you helped make Apex
Legend in the flesh telling you to just get ya purse up
I've been rocking stadiums before they got your first sub
I ain't never been a king, I don't need to be worshipped
But some of y'all gone have to reimburse us, word up
Yo, I was at your concert, yo, you don't want no kinda smokе
How I know I just use my nose like I'm Tanjiro
All I do is win and makе impossible look possible
Petty drama, I'm like Teddy Bomber when I drop it, yo
Idols ain't your rivals? You just in denial
You ain't a boss if you got a disclaimer in your bio
Can't touch the untouchable, shake the unshakable
Talents is unmistakable, Diamond is Unbreakable

[Verse 2: Hi-Rez]
I feel like I'm Huey and Riley with Japanese dubbing
I'm causing a ruckus like I'm Uncle Ruckus
The heater is tucked, but it could get to bucking
I'm clucking a dozen, I don't give a shit
Word to grandad, I got this shit in the damn bag
They think of me highly and just like I'm Riley since I was a youngin my pants sag
Like Huey I'm woke still, but not the type that get folks killed
I got the dope in my coat still, I got the shit for the whole sale
Ain't no time for the chit chat, I don't know you, homie, get back
Promise, you don't wanna get blapped, I am a pimp named slickback
RIP John Withers
All these snakes gone slither
Why you laughing, ain't shit funny
Got the strap like I'm Gin Rummy
I came from the boondocks, you get two shots, I'm a bit scummy
Shut your mouth, you a big dummy, looking at you, you a bit funny
Thank god I'm a Freeman
And that he made me a G, man
I been fighting my demons
I don't get mad, I get even
Thank god I'm a Freeman
And that he made me a G, man
I been fighting my demons
I don't get mad, I get even, Rez

Niggas talking he ain't on my level, we don't flow the same
Told that nigga that I need my flowers, I'm a Rosearade
Metal on me, that shit hit like Zane, back to my colder ways
OG, see me drag racing on the roads you paved
Bitch, I've been the champ since the day I boxed Bruno
A brawler with a Draco, my nigga, I'm Dan Kuso
But still keep shooters that wet you up like Marucho
Got two bad bitches, Julie, Runo, OK
Your little shorty let me in her walls, I guess she Majin Buu
Shorty said I'm sweet, I'm like Vegito with all kinds of blue
One look at the racks and now she asking: "What you tryna do?"
Bruh, your pap is all fiction, that's why she ain't tryna screw
Huh, on my wrist I got a diamond, dude
Joey Wheeler gamble with your life, come roll a die or two
Obliterate that pussy, told that bitch that it was Time to Duel
I feel like Toph, I can see the way the liars move

[Verse 4: PE$O PETE]
Energy maxed when I scream, make the mosh stop
Dabi, Endeavor, and Shoto, bitch my fuckin block hot
Pop, pop, if you really thought you was a hotshot
Nah, nah, that boy gettin knocked off
Yo bitch got her top off, I might give her lockjaw
Got me on my Aizen, if you try him I might pop off
Shooters got fan service, he in hearses with his top gawn
Obito my rocks on, I stay drippin hot sauce
Hitsugaya Toshiro my left wrist kinda frost, frost
Bitch I'm freezin! Right wrist so anemic!
Beat me boy you dreamin! He was schemin!
Like I ain't bring the beam in!
This 45 gon stop his breathing, this fire magic stop his bleedin
Brody stop talk like we even
Cuz if Bankai started cleavin, I bet yo ass is conceding
I'm in the dirt with my demons, and you can't even see em
Y'all like pies, y'all stay sweetened
On my Blackbeard, I just eat em!
Ain't no rapper who can beat me
[Verse 5: Ham Sandwich]
Shikigami summon throw up the hands, and I'm bringing a demon
I got the key and I'm feeling like Keagan
Clippin an op and they thought I was streamin
Doin this shit for myself, and the niggas that know me, so know there ain't no other reason
Stand at attention, they pledgin allegiance
Stans in my mentions, they beggin and pleadin
I got the sauce and they wantin the seasoning
I'm boutta make me a mill, off of reasoning
Pockets are deepening, wallet obesity
Might get arrested for public indecency
Cuz I been saggin so low, that my dick is exposed
To the hoes and the dough overflowin, it's spillin
And showin, I feel like a shogun
I'm stacking the faces, it look like a totem
You talk about weapons, we actually tote em
A chop and a mag, when it dump, make em jump, like a Shonen
They target the kid, but I mark and get rid of em
Leavin em coughin like swallowing cinnamon, *cough cough cough*
Lemme slow it down, though, got ya bitch and we fuckin on the down low
Cuz I caught her like a Pokémon, bust her out the ball, she like a Porygon, way she finna download
Lotta ass kissin, Mudbrays, with the brown nose, wait
I just put a milli on a town home, wait
Goin down home, cuz I now know, how those Super Saiyan niggas on a cloud roll, wait
Super Saiyan nigga on a cloud, with a big stick
Sippin on mystic, big drip, big lit
Big fish, water whippin like a Sharknado
Spinnin through his section with the quickness, bitch!
[Verse 6: Breeton Boi]
Yuh, my verses like Bakugo blasting, they actually banging
My gat a lil Mac, and it's sending 'em packing
You trash in the matchup, it's actually tragic
Like Flappy Bird gameplay, you have to be tapping
Reverse Kaminari, you ain't for the static
You say you the best, then I'm Beerus, I'm napping
You Mario's brother, take L's for the capping, like
Huh, wait huh, might be from Dragon Ball, I got the Ki
None near my level, though they try 2B
He tried to cross me, he turned a new leaf
(Like the game Animal Crossing) I been had bars since before the police
Way that I hop on the beat and I eat, I'm like a Nerdcore carnivore, feel like I'm Freeced
Please find someone who can stop me, been had the green on me, hitting licks no Froppy
Call 'em freestyle, cause for style they robbed me
Seen 'em copy flows, then they spit 'em like Kakashi
And I'm Zabuza, big chop
Been had my bars underrated, I'm pissed off
Jojo punches, each one made the kid stop
The time on this record, that's platinum, guess what?
I keep stacking the cash up, just peep bracket
The week's bag looking like my elite Smash
And to me, winning is a habit, you need practice
So when I sleep, I'mma need me a king mattress
Like DDR, I been making my moves in the right direction for this music
Just look at your keyboard, that's the only time you can say I been anywhere around you U is

[Verse 7: Dan Bull]
I'm a real geek, you can see it by the way I speak
Never got invited to the cool kids' parties, didn't wanna be
You're a motherfucking, motherfucking, fucking asshole
Even when I'm fucking around I got the best flow
Even the sound of my name makes the Nerdcore fans hyper
I don't watch anime, but they still ask me on the cyphers
They're after the clicks and that's not a diss, my raps are just hits
And to any reactor reacting to this, that's a matter of fact, you have to admit
The sass of this kid, did you hear the track that he did?
Now you're about to get blitzed like a rasta amidst the battle of Britain passing a spliff
Inhaling like I'm having an asthma attack or a fit
At this stage in my career path I'm just here, having a laugh with this shit
It's the only way I can retain a basic fraction of passion for it
And if my raps matters, then life from the African diaspora should
But enough of hip hop, I'm off down the chip shop
You want anything packed up or should I carry on cashing my chips?

[Verse 8: Connor Quest!]
Penmanship's a deadly sin, yeah I'm the wrath that Kahn's facing
Don't let your chick get a glimpse, or she'll be stargazing
Admire man's wit, and marvel at my charm, blatant
Ironman fit, but she'd rather I was stark naked
Got more manga than my local Waterstones
I afford it, from my vocal chords and tones, tours and shows
Train my voice religiously, I practice what I preach
Cause I don't wanna fall off, like the latter half of Bleach
Verse crafted like a scatter map
I reach for twists and references you don't expect like Shyamalan scenes, don't stammer that speech
Like George the VI, when talking shit, your doing corporate gigs, for forty quid
I scored a hit, about an authors drawing, bought some shorts and kicks
Made a crash like insomniac, so now I'll wait for death to sleep
Not only got myself to feed
I'm breading up my brothers with a hefty feast
Run with a pack of dogs, I'm Legoshi
Con Quixote, build a legacy, quest complete

[Verse 9: NerdOut]
Insert the disk into the system, get it on tonight
Yeah, my verse is hard as Kirishima cased in Carbonite
Hard as Sephiroth's boss battle in Kingdom Hearts
Your song's garbage, it's horrible like Gilbert Gottfried trying to harmonize
I'm the hardest Nerdy artist, honest, full stop
Bass vibrating on both sides, call that a Dualshock
Duel-wielded pistols pop your top off, but this ain't New Orleans
When you see the flashes, it'll be too late for trigger warnings
Last name Normus, first name Dixie
I'm Sonic 06, you do not wanna play with me
Punchlines fly, turn your eyes purple like Donatello's
My bars are stronger than the family of Dom Toretto
They try to diss, but I don't know why
Been rapping longer than that girl's been studying while listening to Lo-Fi
Throwing fists with me, I'm like a fitted sheet, I'll never be folded up
But if I ever lose, then the TVA will be showing up

[Verse 10: Shofu]
I'm the man, homie, you don't wanna fight, I got these hands on me
Hajime, I Dempsey Roll, a punch'll never land on me
Birdie bitch, banana clips, you know I keep a can on me
Monkey D Luffy, I got all these rubber bands on me
Pussy boy keep talking shit
You gon need a doctor when that Tony Tony Chopper hits
Fucked around and shot a bitch, my weapons on some Noctis shit
Pistol got a kick to it, I'm Sanji on my soccer shit
Cooking up, you could find me in the kitchen, then
All blue, probably thought a nigga cripping, then
I train everyday, you niggas just ain't got no discipline
Hammer named Jack, I might have to let it rip again
Nigga, I just do what it do
Move with a Capone body, they gon shoot when I shoot
Ain't no fucking time skip, bitch, I'm new and improved
Shadow Imitation, I'm gon make em move when I move, I'm saying

[Verse 11: Shwabadi]
Look, like Aang, I wasn't born for the flame
But I still mastered the format the same
I went from awful to top of the range
I went from, Indie to Big Three, Studio Deen to Ghibli
Now they marvel and give props, I might be Disney
I'm steady blowing up in this game, I'ma be like Genthru
You could train, all your life, but you still get the blade like Enmu
They begging for a feature, tell 'em drop a bean like Sensu
Your power level pitiful, the scouter couldn't sense you
There's a bear in the booth, he's bearing a tool
You hear a doo doo doo, I'm just airing my views
They don't wanna meet, for the beef, vegetarian food
You got no cash? Leave 'em hanging like they're wearing a noose
They're scared of the truth, these bitches know that money talks
I don't fuck with snakes, and homie you look like your tongue is forked
Bet the stick could light up your whole crew, Dumbledore
And my chopper so big that it might have popped a Rumble Ball

[Verse 12: GameboyJones]
I'm quitting Nerdcore, shut up nigga I don't care
L's, step aside, I got no time for squares
People playing games with my W, ain't Wario but I'm aware
Donkey Kong, Banjo, nigga I'm all types of Rare
Game and Watch, always keep a 9 by mide side B
In case a nigga Rimuru, the way they moving, slimy
Talking tough on Twitter, you can fight me
Either way, I made a living, rapping over, type beats
And now I got these girls like Anna, when I hit it they be tighten up
Running through them walls, just like I'm Iida when I pipe it up
Took out all my competition cause they wasn't nice enough
Now all my loot is golden so I guess I got the Midas touch
You a hater, leave a comment kepp on talking bitch
I'll put five, to your face, on some Shigaraki shit
Bucky Barnes with the bars, I don't need to cap
I don't need to rap, this an easy bag
