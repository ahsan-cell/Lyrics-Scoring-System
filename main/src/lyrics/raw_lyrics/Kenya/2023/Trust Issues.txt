Yeah, yeah
One time my homie stopped and asked me how to talk to God
I asked him, "What if He responds?"
And you lost your fear about it
What if you felt so clear about it
What if your soul was so filled you couldn't help but sing those lyrics louder
They say you so charismatic, obvious that you missing something
I say they so academic, their form of godliness is missing something
This is when it’s music, yeah
This is like Azusa, yeah
Told the people this will change you, this is how you prove it, yeah
I wanna tell the truth like Dave Chappelle
I wanna tell the truth I was made to tell
I wanna tell stories like Dr. Luke
See the shadow pass and then it made you well
They say this is a different time
Vacation like mission work
You can raise support, go overseas, get a brown skin baby take a pic and smile
See Simon teaching Simon what’s the real versus sorcery
I tell you what is written, we stay clear of those forgeries
We baptized in that fire, don’t tell me all them lies
This is witness testimony; look, I seen the dead rise
This is power
Do you believe in power?
Do you believe in power?

That's that power when you can't move
Power when you empty
Power at your weakest moment
Power when they tempt you
That power when it's complex
And power when it's simple
The power when it's fake to you
And power when it's, when it's real, yeah

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
I got enough issues
I don't need trust issues
Nothing is coincidental
I'm hoping that touched your mental
I showed out with too much potential
My black fish on the wheel of this rental
Lord, I pray you crush every ounce of pride
That even touch my temple
I'm God's child, there's certain things I can't opt out
His school of thought I can't drop out
Who we are will bring the cops out
My skin alone might send me home
Like I'm no soul, just skin and bones
Still a man after God's heart
But only half of me, like a pie chart
The other half of me, if judged accurately
Is a catastrophe, and that's my part
What's constructed here might cut your ear
I read God's Sword to keep my mind sharp
And it's encore after encore
On a night shift, like the Commodores
They drawing guns like "The Art of War"
I gotta guard my heart and try to keep it pure
'Cause the Reaper out with the ether out
We're corrupted by the things we speak about
These lungs used to blow reafer out
Now they used to blow speakers out
And this industry, they wanna keep us out
'Cause if they blind, we'll lead em out
We say His name, they beep it out
And you wonder why nobody reaching out
[Bridge: Taelor Gray]
Yeah, 'cause they never seen that power
Now you looking at that power
Yeah, we be walking in that power

[Hook:]
That's that power when you can't move
Power when you empty
Power at your weakest moment
Power when they tempt you
It's power when it's complex
Power when it's simple
And power when it's fake to you
Power when it's, when it's real, yeah1
