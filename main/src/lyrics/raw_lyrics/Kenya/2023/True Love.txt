Not too naive to understand my blessing
Celebrating that god created you
True love is staying out past midnight
Late night conversating 'bout this life
Your beauty on the outside and inside

You're pretty so mi haffi get to know you
Don't tell a lie, mi a tell a truth
Nobody else ever haffi do
This love, it feels like I'm in a movie
And I just
I just want to get to know ya
Put my arms round and hold ya
You were designed with, me in mind, my love
And I'll love, you 'til this life is over
Known you in a lifе before herе
You were designed with, me in mind, my love (eh-eh-eh-eh)
Jewolaweri (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), nyothijomoku (yeah-yeah-yeah)
Jewolaweri (oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), nyothijomoku (yeah-yeah-yeah)

True love is putting someone before you
Time is so precious, I can't afford to
Waste a second if she's not by my side
True love is more than wedding bands on you
Holding you down when the world falls on you
Seeing the world in somebody else's eyes
You might also like(You, you're pretty so) you're pretty so mi haffi get to know you
Don't tell a lie, mi a tell a truth
Nobody else ever haffi do
This love, it feels like I'm in a movie

You were designed with, me in mind, my love
And I'll love, you 'til this life is over
Known you in a life before here
You were designed with me, in mind, my love (eh-eh-eh-eh)
