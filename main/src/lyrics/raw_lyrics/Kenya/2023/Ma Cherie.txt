My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
Ma cherie coco
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
Ma cherie coco
[Verse 1]
First time I saw you
I know you are the one
Don’t wanna loose you
I need you with me (I need you with me)
Sweet melody that I needed the most
Can’t imagine life without my cherie
(Without my chеrie)
Never wanna hеar you cry
I wanna bring out the best in you
So that we can share this life
There’s nothing I wouldn’t do
Only wanna see you smile
Even if you don’t have the reason to
You came at the perfect time
It’s like I was sent here to rescue
[Chorus]
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
Ma cherie coco
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
Ma cherie coco
[Verse 2]
Maisha London
When I’m with you maisha London
Take my mind and my body ooh
I’ll be the one you can depend on
And I’ll be good to you
Ooh my baby I’ll be good to you
Be the light for your body
I’ll be the fire to your candle
Never wanna hear you cry
I wanna bring out the best in you
So that we can share this life
There’s nothing I wouldn’t do
Only wanna see you smile
Even if you don’t have the reason to
You came at the perfect time
It’s like I was sent here to rescue
[Chorus]
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
Ma cherie coco
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
My cherie oh my cherie
