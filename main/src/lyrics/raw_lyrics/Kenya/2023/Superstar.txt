My hair is chopped so I chop the coke
D-d-downtown shopping while I smoke
So much hairspray, you could choke
And I break my back for a ten inch poke
I like dick, a-a-and pussy too
If you in between I still fuck with you
I like oral, anal, gangbang queen
All lit up like a movie scene
See on the screen, I'm smokin’ hot
Don't like relaxin' so I don’t smoke pot
I pop the X, I'll fuck your ex
I'm buyin' furs with my TV checks
Ayesha Erotica, so eclectic
Watch my life, it's so damn hectic
From Malibu to Jersey Shore
I'm your step dad's favorite whore (Whore, whore, whore, whore)

[Chorus]
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I’m a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I’m a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I’m a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar! (Ow!, O-o-o-ow!)

In leather pants, baby, watch me dance
Look don't touch, boy, watch your hands
I got little tits and juicy lips
Juicy wrists sittin' on my hips
I flip my sidekick open
Wet pussy lips, my style is soaking
Drive high, bitch, DUI
Bitch, I do everything modified
If I don’t reply it's 'cause I'm pissy
Dominatrix, come be my sissy
My best friend Kiki, supermodel
Kinsley throw back Jager bottles
We're daddy's girls who don't want a daddy
Keep a bald cunt but my jacket's shabby
Never beat around a bush, I dive right in
I'ma makeout wit' your sideways grin (Gri-gri-gri-gr)

[Chorus]
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar! (Ow!, O-o-o-ow!)
[Bridge]
Coc-coc-c-c-cocaine superstar (Ow!)
Coc-coc-coc-co-co-co-cocaine superstar (Ow!)
Cocaine-e-e, coc-coc-coc-cocaine superstar (Ow!)
Co-co-co-co-co-conaine-cocaine-cocaine superstar (Ow!)

[Chorus]
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!
Who the fuck do you think you are? I'm a cocaine superstar!

[Outro]
I'm a cocaine superstar!
