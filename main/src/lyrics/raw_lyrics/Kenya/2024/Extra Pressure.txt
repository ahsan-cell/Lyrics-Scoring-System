[Chorus: Bien]
Extra pressure baby when you whine and pause
You're killin' the boy of course
You’re killin' the boy of course

[Verse 1: Bien]
I had to put my life on pause and follow you where you're goin’
And if I make you my business I suffer no loss
'Cause I'm in love and it's your win
Hmm, no force can’t separate
Baby, no loss keep mе away
I take you on top, pretty baby I give you somеthing to live for
My girl

Extra pressure baby when you whine and pause
You're killin' the boy of course
You're killin' the boy of course
You're killin' the boy
Extra pressure baby when you whine and pause
You're killin' the boy of course
You're killin' the boy of course
You're killin' the boy
