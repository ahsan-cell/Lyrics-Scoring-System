Why can’t you just sit right next to me?
Break it down, then take my misery
Hand in hand, we'll soon see victory
And actions speak louder than those apologies

[Verse]
One for sorrow, and two for joy
We got three for a girl that my heart avoids
And four times that more time my opps rejoice
But I keep pure, don’t rewind with carbon boys
And too many man, can’t stand
To see you hold hands with a bad gyal like me
And too many guys act nice for the bright lights
But they ain’t pure like me
And how many times man a ask how I roll
Tryna class man in category?
But this is how I see
Stronger, all these man are weak
Bell L!BAAN, see if he free
Ah, we just sip our tea
Avoid toxic energy
This is where our people be
From the ten to the East
From our uncles to our niece
If you with me, hear the beat
London city set me free
You might also like[Chorus]
Why can’t you just sit right next to me?
Break it down, then take my misery
Hand in hand, we'll soon see victory
And actions speak louder than those apologies
Why can’t you just sit right next to me?
While Babylon hit us with all the trickery
My heart, my soul can’t take no more injury
And actions speak louder than those apologies

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Why can’t you just sit right next to me?
Break it down, then take my misery
Hand in hand, we'll soon see victory
And actions speak louder than those apologies

[Outro]
Why can’t you just sit right next to me?
While Babylon hit us with all the trickery
My heart, my soul can’t take no more injury2
