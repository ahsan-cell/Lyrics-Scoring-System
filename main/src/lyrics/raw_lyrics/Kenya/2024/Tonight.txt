Feel this energy, between you and me
Take it if you want to
If you wanna come and take advantage of me tonight
Feel this energy, between you and me (You and me)
Take it if you want to
If you wanna come and take advantage of me tonight

[Verse 1: Nikita Kering']
Show me your place I'm on my way right now
Keep me awake up in your bed I’m down
Playing him my song he feel the bass line now
Turn me around and he said, "whine up on me body girl
Whine up on me, pick it up you dropped your crown down shawty
It'd be wise to name your price lady
Open your eyes, hop on this ride I'm rеady"

[Chorus: Nikita Kering']
Feel this energy, between you and mе
Take it if you want to
If you wanna come and take advantage of me tonight
Feel this energy, between you and me (You and me)
Take it if you want to
If you wanna come and take advantage of me tonight

[Post-Chorus: Nikita Kering' & Lilmaina]
There you go again, there you go again
Looking innocent but that don’t mean you're heaven sent
It's irrelevant all your sentiments
There you go again, there you go again
Looking innocent but that don't mean you're heaven sent
It's irrelevant all your sentiments
Krrrr ha (Bae, baby, baby, baby)

Si basi twende East tuone life ya ma G
Naskia we ndio Beyonce Stunna ndio Jay- Z
I really need your energy tubonge mami
First date nilimshikia hio mbling Eastleigh
'Cause I'm really tryna invest you, kiss and caress you
Staki kukuforce bana nadai ukuje kwetu
Tonight I befriend you, wewe ndio menu

Skia, I like the way you dress mami, unani-impress(Unani-impress)
And tonight I just want to caress
Na matime tumekosana si unajua unanistress
Usiskize hao ma nambli your’e my only mresh
Plus, I don’t kiss and tell nina vibes ka Kartel
Waiter nipatie hio Coke  alafu hio Martel
Na sijui kaa unanidai man it's so hard to tell
Man I need you, I want you, does that ring a bell?

If you wanna come and take advantage of me tonight

If you wanna come and take advantage of me tonight
