She said that she ain't with it unless sees me on the road
She  out here tryna get it with a nigga for the dough
She out here tryna get it for the nigga booking shows
And I done told here that this thing it really ain't a game
She out here thinking that for real she out here getting saved
They don't really know a nigga don't have time for games
They don't really know I'm booking flights down to LA
Someone get the hub and we might hit it down at beechwood
Getting faded with the boys, we do it just to feel good
Women always coming cause I guess we give out free booze
We be playing trap in the burbs just to feel hood
Sachien told me watch out for niggas that you knew
They might try to be your friends because your doing you
Never thought that people really want me for the fame
But dawg this is the year, yeah the year that we gone change

We gone
We gone change up, make a lil rain now
Get a lil range now, tell em that we famous
Tell em that we changed up, yeah we changed up
We gone change up, make a lil rain now
Get a lil range now, tell em that we famous
Tell em that we changed up, yeah we changed up

Now I be out here 5 am I'm driving in to work
Working so I can use summer as a verb
They ask me what I'm smoking always tell em that's just herbs
Momma says she love me she just wish I went to church
Haven't left the country in about 3 years
Suppose to go to Canada to see Daanbeer
Haven't seen that boy in what's that about a year
I told him I'd be there, this shit just isn't fair
No, I be breaking promises I really wanna keep
Got me going crazy man this thing affects my sleep
Couldn't go Zanzibar and yeah that hit me deep
What a fucking thing, let a nigga preach
Ow, man I just been thinking can a nigga make some change
Drive a Lamborghini with a swisher switching lanes
Doing 120 down the highway getting brain
It's going be ok, we gone fucking change
