[Verse 1: Tamar]
I saw your man cheatin' low
Hidin' out on the low at the show
Gotta let you know, I gotta let you know
'Cause he's ridin' out in the six, with that trick
Gotta admit, that nigga slick
I told you he ain't shit here
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

If you say your man's not doin' you right
And if you say he don't work it right
And if he's comin' home while it late at night
Let him go (Let him go)
Just let him go (Just let him go)
If you're doin' more than he's doin' for you
And if he ain't got no time for you
If he give her all your money and he has none for you (Oh, no)
Let him go (Him go, no)
Just let him go, yeah

[Verse 2: Tamar]
How many times, how many lies?
How many nights you gonna cry
And be there all alone?
Oh, alone, no
Why can't you see?
Just make him leave, then take the key
'Cause girl, believe, he'll be back again
Again, again, again, again

[Chorus: Tamar]
If you say your man's not doin' you right (Oh)

Let him go (You)
Just let him go, yeah (Let him go)
[Bridge: Tamar]
Why don't you want a man to treat you right, and (A man to treat you right)
Why do you sit and listen to all his lies? (Listen, yeah)
You don't wanna take care of a grown man all your life
Just disconnect the phone (Girl, get him out the phone)
And leave the man alone, let him go

[Verse 3: Solé]
Uh, girl, leave that nigga alone
Shoulda been gone, when he pulled that shit with the cell phone
Motherfucker wanna lie 'cause he dead wrong
Seen him out with the bitch and the shit's blown
Ain't love though
Put him out, don't ask for shit
Fast as shit, pussy like this be the last of shit
He be beggin' for the past chick
Thinkin' 'bout fuckin' you when he jackin' shit, yeah
What you been through, seein' him slip, seein' him trip
Seein' the other bitches that he's flossin' with
Just make sure you's ain't share a sip
From his hand up a skirt, will fill the ditch, yeah
You can tell in his eyes his lies
Hypnotized with a lil' goodbye
Fuck the times you cried
He'll be in for a big surprise
'Cause it's time to fly, the love died, yeah
You way too good for that nigga
Did all you should for that nigga
Love had you blinded, rewinded
Died if you could for that nigga
You trade your life for that nigga
You'd be a wife for that nigga
If he can't match it with sorries, you make it right for that nigga
What the fuck is the problem here? Solve it here
You should get the shit, full mob in here
Clean him out like you robbin' here
Don't be cryin', ain't a nigga got a job in here, yeah
You ain't had any luck with that, 'sup with that?
Everybody knows you fuck with that
See a chicken, better pluck with that
High class, hifi, can't fuck with that, what?
[Chorus: Tamar]
If you say your man's not doin' you right (Let him go, doin' you right)
And if you say he don't work it right (Workin' it right)
And if he's comin' home while it late at night (Late at night)
Let him go (Oh-oh)
Just let him go (Oh-oh-oh)
If you're doin' more than he's doin' for you (Oh-oh, doin' for you)
And if he ain't got no time for you (Time for you)
If he give her all your money and he has none for you (Money)
Let him go (Go)
Just let him go, yeah (Go, oh)
