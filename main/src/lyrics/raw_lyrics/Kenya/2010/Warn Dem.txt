[Verse 1: Dave East]
She beggin' me like, "Daddy can you stay another night?" (I'm out)
This paper waitin' for me, ma, I gotta make this flight
If I ever did you wrong, I'ma try to make it right (I try)
Your body got me hungry, tryin' to eat that shit like rice (Hmm)
Buy you anything you want in the store, just name a price (Got it)
Hope I don't ace out, this life is a game of dice
She climbеd on top of me said, "I'm 'bout to change your life"
Oncе I start ain't no stoppin' me, guaranteed we breakin' night (Night)
We linked up in real life, met her on the 'Gram
Said she enjoy bein' single, she ain't want a man
In the spot drunk, she ain't ask me if I want to dance (At all)
Pistol on my side if it get live, hope it don't wanna jam (Bah, bah)
Uh, laid up by the water, I just want a tan (Tan, uh)
I've been on the low like I'm a wanted man (I'm low, uh)
All these sticks and drums, I could join a band (Grrah)
Don't get tricked, most of these bitches look better on the 'Gram

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I got up out the projects and I've been around the globe (Globe)
Other cities chillin' with women I didn't know (What's up?)
Smokin', reminiscin', like, "What if I didn't blow?"
Thinkin' about past chicks and the love I didn't show (My bad)
Sorry love, I planted a seed but it didn't grow (Nah)
You was never really my speed but I didn't know (No)
It's foreign if I'm in it, just chillin' my fitted low (Skrr)
My man got life, takin' that trip, I'm so glad I didn't go
I got her body movin' (Movin')
Her body shakin', I told her I probably die unruly (Unruly)
Mafioso, I'm smokin' watchin' the Gotti movie (Gotti)
Shy when I met her, she told me boy I am not a groupie
Diamonds on me drippin' like I just got up out a Jacuzzi
Four deep, we was dead broke, used to ride in a hooptie (My niggas)
Just know I'm directin' it so nobody stop in this movie (Nobody)
If you from the bottom and you got it you gotta salute me (Salute)
If not you gotta come shoot me (Boom)
Nigga it's lit, lightin' spliff after spliff, we got it polluted (Light up)
Bunch of youth, they just wanna shoot, we probably recruit 'em (Youth dem)
Until the bag on, a badman, I ain't gotta prove it (Badman)
They put that pressure on you, now you gotta do it
I'm watchin' for the vultures, got her all up on the wall just like a poster (Come here)
Her body start to melt as I get closer (Ooh)
VLone all up in my closet, I'm a loner
I fuck her 'til it's hard to wake her up, she in a coma (Wake up)
And then Uber back to her owner

My kind of badness, Glock with the cartridge
I gotta get this paper, bein' broke is not an option
We movin', me and Junior like Malone and Stackton
You can't believe a word these bitches say, they like to gossip
I had trap scams on Batman, welcome to Gotham
Headshot, change your hair color, Dennis Rodman
