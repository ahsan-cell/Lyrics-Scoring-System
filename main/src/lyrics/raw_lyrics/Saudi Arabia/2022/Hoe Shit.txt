[Verse 1: Ohgeesy]
Fourty ounces of that juice, bitch this is ain't no minute made
I give your bitch back, give me 40 minutes, man
I heard you did it first with the fuck these niggas sayin'
Spent my money on the perc', then i did champagne, look
Barley with the bars, nigga that's ain't xanpagne
She fucks the whole team 'cause she loves the campaign
Step up in the spot, better tuck your damn chain
Fuck you finna do, nigga, not a damn thing

[Verse 2: Ohgeesy]

And show her how the vicious mode, nigga gang gang
Asked why she fucked me, she said "for lil famе"
Damn bitch so stupid, but fuck it I can't complain
Call her over one morе time, and I'mma get her brain
Get the face, get the head, get the knocking (get the knockin')
Always sippin' medicine, but I ain't coughing (i ain't cuffed)
I just poured me a six, but i ain't sick (i ain't sick)
And if she sucking, she gonna swallow, she don't spit (swallow)
If I'm with that bitch, i swear that she the shit (shit the shit)
If i hit it just once, she ain't shit (not a thang)
And if she goes two ways, tell her to bring a friend
She got three series in the benz
And i count it up, keep count it up again (count it)
And i run it up, run it up again (run it, run it)
And she fuck me, and she fuck me and my friends (fuck me, fuck me)
And she fuck me, fuck fuck fuck me and my friends (and my, and my)
