Man didn't have to take off the door (Nah)
Pull up in the dinger, straight through the hole in the floor
We’re the toddlers, don't know what you thought
By the end of the night, you’ll be picking up your jaw
Plants, not ten or twenty
Run up in the crop gaff with Eggs Benny (Agh)
Mans 'ead got cracked and his legs went jelly (Blow)

[Verse 1]
Just know that we're leaving the room with every last penny
No joke, man don't boast
Just know it's over when you see Ghost
Spinning back kick might take off your nose
Man don't want that smoke
Big elbow to the top of the dome (What?)
Man don't want that smoke, nah
And I'm Ernie, the left hand's fast but the right hand's sturdy
They know I been bad from early
Your likkle 'eadlock can't hurt me
I'm fighting dirty, Jim (Chin)
You already know man can't fuck with him
When it comes to this fighting ting, manna head butt him (Yeah)
Put in the double 'ead take down
Primetime's like Joe Rogan with the MMA breakdown
And once everybody's sleeping, it turns into a playground

[Interlude]
Put it on the net, do you wanna bet it will do a milly in a sec? (Agh)
Put it on the net, do you wanna bet it will do a milly in a sec? (Agh)
Put it on the net, do you wanna bet it will do a milly in a sec? (Agh)
Put it on the net, do you wanna bet it will do a milly in a sec? (Agh, haha)

Boxes of bush (Toddlers)
All buds, no dust (Yeah)
Boxes and boxes and boxes, we’re the toddlers, are you dumb?
[Verse 2]
We’re the toddlers, are you dumb?
Just know that we come from the bottom of the slum
And we're hungry, means we're coming for the crumbs
And we're like a taxman, cah we're coming for your funds
Bang, bang, you see us in a gang
Hop out the back of the blue transit van (Yeah)
Nuff man have never had money in a bank
With these 25 grand in elastic bands (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We've always got drastic plans, like Bill Sykes we’ll take your pots and pans (Yeah)
How many million views did we do last week?
Man I got too many fans (What?)
Swear down, man are drastic
You don't wanna get left in a casket (What?)
If we run up in a crib and it's filled with weed, then we're leaving with it in a basket (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
Boxes of bush (Boxes)
All buds, no dust
Boxes and boxes and boxes, we’re the toddlers, are you dumb? (Toddlers)
Boxes of bush (Boxes)
All buds, no dust
Boxes and boxes and boxes, we’re the toddlers, are you dumb? (Ayy)
Boxes of bush (Boxes)
All buds, no dust
Boxes and boxes and boxes, we’re the toddlers, are you dumb? (Toddlers)
Boxes of bush (Boxes)
All buds, no dust
Boxes and boxes and boxes, we’re the toddlers, are you dumb? (Ayy)3
