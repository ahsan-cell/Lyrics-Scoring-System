Not every journey, is for every man

[Chorus: Skip Marley]
Shotgun pump action
And mi cause a commotion
Mista Selecta, put that rewind in motion
Shotgun pump action
Let them know what's up
Mista Selecta, better wheel it up
Shotgun pump action

[Verse 1: Bugzy Malone]
I'm in the back seat, I'm on the left flank
Range Rover lookin' like a big tank
SVR soundin' like a Mustang
Grab onto the barrel with your left hand
Ever seen five man hop out of the four-door?
Moncler smelling like a Tom Ford
Greeted them in French, I'm sayin' "Bonjour"
Decorate the face, I'm on that contour
I'm on the freewheeler with the cleaver
Deep cut, tell 'em free Reetra
If this was '013 then I'd have the pumpy put down in Moston with Nikita
Man are no stranger to the snub-nose
Everywhere we go we make the snow go
Little bit of pressure and the leg broke
Everybody's bad until they get smoked
You might also like[Chorus: Skip Marley]
Shotgun pump action
And mi cause a commotion
Mista Selecta, put that rewind in motion
Shotgun pump action
Let them know what's up
Mista Selecta, better wheel it up
Shotgun pump action

[Verse 2: Bugzy Malone]
When I'm in the passy, I say "shotgun"
Them man are chattin' like they got one
I play games 'cause I never lost one
It's mafia music but not like Rick Ross done
Bottle of the 'Roccy, bottle of the 'Trón
Do most of my business on the telephone
They still can't believe it when they see me now
They have to look twice because they lookin' at a criminal
Come a long way from trimmin' leaves off
This one's a classic but it's not a Reebok
The creps are boomin', we need a re-stock
Never rustle up the feathers of a peacock
I'm from the 6-1, I bring the flavour
I'm representin' in Jamaica
I'm givin' it away, it's only paper
Skip, tell 'em all about the danger
[Chorus: Skip Marley]
Shotgun pump action
And mi cause a commotion
Mista Selecta, put that rewind in motion
Shotgun pump action
Let them know what's up
Mista Selecta, better wheel it up
Shotgun pump action

[Verse 3: Skip Marley]
Can't control
This ah di style ah dem can't condone
Summer jam, mi set all da badman tone
Oh aye, check it out, dem ah bad-boy clown
Love rum brown
How mi take control, call dem love rum brown
Lion in the jungle, dem last one 'round
King of kings and Lord of the throne
UK, Manchester down to Jamaica
Rise up di ting, top shotta

[Chorus: Skip Marley]
Shotgun pump action
And mi cause a commotion
Mista Selecta, put that rewind in motion
Shotgun pump action
Let them know what's up
Mista Selecta, better wheel it up
Shotgun pump action
[Outro: Skip Marley]
