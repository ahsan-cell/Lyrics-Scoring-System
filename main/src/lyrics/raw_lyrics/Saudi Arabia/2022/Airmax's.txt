No promo, tell my bro's I love 'em
'Cah I lost man, I can't kiss and hug 'em
I might call bro 'cause that ain't my cousin
If I call my man fam, that's gang
Watch how I step, don't look at my kicks
I've been grindin', I've been stuck in the mix
If you're my darg then I love you to bits
If I ever did switch then call up the pigs

[Verse 1]
I'm a master, I can't fuck up the mix
I run it up while you run up your lips
Keep runnin' your big lips, while I'm runnin' my digits
Man ah giant in this ting, them man are midgets
Couple man that I missed that are still on my hit-list
Them man are pissed 'cah I'm sittin' on hits
When it's crunch time like I'm steppin' on crisps
Free the mandem, yeah, I swear I miss 'em
Shit ain't the same when they'rе in prison
Ain't many man that share this vision
Is what it is, it's the way we livin'
I know that it's wrong but I still won't listеn
Tryna make a whole mil out the kitchen
Thought he was saucing, caught him, dipped him
Don't call me "Bro", I don't war with siblings
You might also like[Chorus]
No promo, tell my bro's I love 'em
'Cah I lost man, I can't kiss and hug 'em
I might call bro 'cause that ain't my cousin
If I call my man fam, that's gang
Watch how I step, don't look at my kicks
I've been grindin', I've been stuck in the mix (Grind)
If you're my darg then I love you to bits
If I ever did switch then call up the pigs

[Verse 2]
Caught him, cheffed him, shiv'd him
Torched the pricks and I left 'em limping
I'll have the TEC just ringin'
D on my neck just blingin'
To different, I use to move difference
Before social distant, I use to move distant
Anti-social, I keep puttin' dank in Rizla's
You can't mix friends with business
She a bad bitch but she bare catfish
How dare they say they're active
110's and some Airmax's
I just wanna' get rich, cop bare 'matics
That's why I'm in the T with bare addicts
That's why I hit licks and rap like this
I'm addicted to sticks and mathematics
If I ever did switch, it's a mad man ting
[Chorus]
No promo, tell my bro's I love 'em
'Cah I lost man, I can't kiss and hug 'em
I might call bro 'cause that ain't my cousin
If I call my man fam, that's gang
Watch how I step, don't look at my kicks
I've been grindin', I've been stuck in the mix (Grind)
If you're my darg then I love you to bits
If I ever did switch then call up the pigs

[Verse 3]
Though this rap shit's fucked, got M's on my mind
I got messages in my DM's saying, "Rent me a line"
I just copped a new stick but I got skengs on my mind
Three bags for the [?], but I got [?]
[?] '99, plus I'm busy all the time
And I got Lizzy on my mind, now six-figures seems light
Let the fans take picture, tryna make eight-figures
Streets ain't easy, I've seen fiends turn snitches
For the C.R.E.A.M we burn bridges
Gotta learn business
Sometimes I remind myself I'm the only nigga that did this
Big litness, ticking sticks off the wish-list
Extended, big whistlers
Send me pictures encrypted
I got life, I risked it
I wish I got life like **** did
(I'm alive, I did this)
[Chorus]
No promo, tell my bro's I love 'em
'Cah I lost man, I can't kiss and hug 'em
I might call bro 'cause that ain't my cousin
If I call my man fam, that's gang
Watch how I step, don't look at my kicks
I've been grindin', I've been stuck in the mix (Grind)
If you're my darg then I love you to bits
If I ever did switch then call up the pigs

[Outro]
110's and some Airmax's, I just—
Co— Copped bare 'matics
110's and some Airmax's, I just—
It's a mad man ting
