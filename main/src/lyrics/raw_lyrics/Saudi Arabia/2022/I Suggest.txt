Who did he want?
Me?
Usually don't-
Usually don't end well
I suggest you don't come round here
I suggest you just keep it cool

[Verse 1]
See when I get like this, I suggest nobody comes near
Don't touch me and don't look at me for too long, beware
When my hands start shaking I just wanna make 'em fear
That's 'cause I come from a place where nobody could hear me
Listen up good 'cause I'm gonna say this bit clearly
I'm an MC but I'm only an MC in theory
The reality is I don't do halfway or nearly
And that's why when I go, I go in deep 'n' sincerely
I'm trying to be good, trying to be cool, trying to be better
I hope the judge can forgive me, I'm sat here writing him a letter
There was CCTV and she said it was a vendetta
I don't want community service but I'll go guilty, forget her

[Hook]
Who did he want?
Who did he want?
Me?
What did he want?
What did he want, beef?
Usually don't-
Usually don't end well
I suggest you don't stare at me
I suggest you don't come round here
I suggest you just leave it be
I suggest you just keep it cool

You ran up in my room and told me that it was his
And bear in mind these times I was only a kid
Traumatised I just opened a book and put him on a list
And I swore that I'd get him back when I was old enough to switch
No violations, no disrespect and that's fine
He said don't forget remorse cos the letter is vital
I'm sat here looking at a blank page just being bone idle
And when I think back to the night, I just wanna go psycho
Tryna be the man, tryna be the wolf, tryna' do a Leonardo
Tryna get a Spyder, and I'm tryna get a Gallardo
I'm better than Creed, better than Rocky, better than Drago
Me, I'm tryna be what Al Capone was to Chicago
