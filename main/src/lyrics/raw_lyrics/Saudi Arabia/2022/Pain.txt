Ah, they say life's not about waiting for the storm to pass
It's about learning to dance in the rain
Bugzy Malone
You know? Watch this

[Verse 1]
It's not physical pain, it's psychological pain
Emotionally scarred so bad I was wearing a mask like Bane
Not an actual mask, a psychological mask
What do you find that mad?
What about a kid that had to find his dad
Only to find that he didn't like him back
Not physical pain, psychological pain
I seen it from the beginning, I was there on the wedding day
The happiest kid in the world when I'd seen the smile on my mum's face
I thought it was real
I heard the vows, I threw the confetti
Little did I know it was fake
Not physical pain, it's psychological pain
Everything I loved in life just went up in flames
I went from cold to freezing
I watched the family break into pieces
I thought that adults could iron out creases
I thought family was cousins and nephews and nieces, not arguments and police
Not physical pain, it's psychological pain
And if you look closely enough you can see the pain in my face
All the confusion, too many lies
It's all an illusion, nobody tries to understand
You get kicked to the kerb and nobody says one word
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm a bad boy and I know why
I get mad 'cause I said I won't cry
And the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry
You're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
I'm a bad boy and I know why
I get mad 'cause I said I won't cry
And the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry
You're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy

[Verse 2]
Ya'
It's not physical pain, it's psychological pain
And I'd be lying to myself if I said I didn't miss Dane
I watched him come from Jamaica
Sat with him playing on Sega
Sat thinking about paper
Me and him were the same age, and it just meant that we were rebellious by nature
Physical pain, psychological pain
They sent him back, while I was sat locked up in a cage
I hit the roadside pissed, told him over the phone "wait there I'll bring him home"
Tried to make money in time, but it was too late
It's not physical pain, it's psychological pain
They told me he fell from a bus and got bleeding on the brain
I prayed to The Lord, bring him back if he could live normal
He was in a coma, no-one's immortal
Turns out his condition was awful, it must have been fate
It's not physical pain, it's psychological pain
And if the storm don't pass then I'm going to dance in the rain
'Cause no matter what I'm a soldier, the world gets colder and colder
Every day that I get older I realise that life's way to short to play games
[Chorus]
I'm a bad boy and I know why
I get mad 'cause I said I won't cry
And the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry
You're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
I'm a bad boy and I know why
I get mad 'cause I said I won't cry
And the pain runs deeper than the blue sea, but the tears they will never run dry
You're looking at a bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy

[Outro]
Bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy
Bad boy, bad, bad boy7
