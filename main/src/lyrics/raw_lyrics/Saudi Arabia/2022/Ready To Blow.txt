I went from 0-100 real quick, all by talking some real shit
I got a taste of happiness, 'till I realized that people just wanna steal this
And when they say that money buys comfort, just know that it's a real myth
I went from eighteen to like thirty-six, to like seventy-two, still ready to flip
I got a million views
And it felt like a million people wanted this seat
He wants to know me, she wants a piece
He wants to know if she's got the D
'Cause I am the guy that he wants to be
But I was grinding while he was asleep
I'm sleep deprived; I nodded off and woken up in the driver's seat
Looked in the rear view mirror
Notin' but darkness 'cause I'm in too deep
No turning back, I'm overexposed
Ten-thousand views and I was cold
Twenty-thousand views used to be loads
I was known all over my postcode
Nine-hundred and eighty-thousand views later and I'm noticed by the MOBOs

[Chorus]
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Back then nobody wanted to know
I said back then nobody wanted to know
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Now people are ringing off my phone
Now people are ringing off my phone
You might also like[Verse 2]
Imagine me standing on that stage
Who would I thank? What would I say?
I'd probably start with a moment of silence
The struggle has faded way
I've not come to do what's been done, understand I will change the game
And when I'm playlisted and when I'm used to fame
I'll do a Cassius Clay, and I'll change my name
Because my last name isn't my dad's name
'Cause my dad never wanted to know
But when he heard I was gonna be famous, he won't stop ringing off my phone
Tell him there's nobody home
'Cause I'm way too busy putting Manchester on the map
And I'm Bugzy Malone
That's no secret, everybody on Twitter knows that
When will I get a blue tick?
I'm like David Blaine with a new trick
'Cause when I say 0161, Manny on the map, everybody in the room goes sick
I am the evolution of grime
In fact, I am way before my time
Nobody wanted to know me back then, so I just rung people off my line

[Chorus]
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Back then nobody wanted to know
I said back then nobody wanted to know
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Now people are ringing off my phone
Now people are ringing off my phone
[Post-Chorus]
I don't know these people, these people don't know me
I come from the bottom, and the bottom's kinda lonely
I said I don't know these girls, and these girls they don't know me
But now they want my number all of a sudden to phone me
I said I don't know these brothers, these brothers don't know me
But now they wanna swear down on their lives that we were cosy
I said all I got's my people and all my people know me
All my people know me, I said all my people know me

[Chorus]
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Back then nobody wanted to know
I said back then nobody wanted to know
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Now people are ringing off my phone
Now people are ringing off my phone
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Back then nobody wanted to know
I said back then nobody wanted to know
I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow, I'm ready to blow
Now people are ringing off my phone
Now people are ringing off my phone

[Post-Chorus]
I don't know these people, these people don't know me
I come from the bottom, and the bottom's kinda lonely
I said I don't know these girls, and these girls they don't know me
But now they want my number all of a sudden to phone me
I said I don't know these brothers, these brothers don't know me
But now they wanna swear down on their lives that we were cosy
I said all I got's my people and all my people know me
All my people know me, I said all my people know me
