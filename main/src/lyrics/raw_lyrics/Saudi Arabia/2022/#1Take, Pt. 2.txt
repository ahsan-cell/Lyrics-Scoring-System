M-I-S to the fucking T
#1TAKE Part 2
Shadow on the fuckin' beat
Gang fuckin' business
Hold tight all my apnas, karlas, gouras, all a dat
Lets fucking get dem
(ShadowOnTheBeat)

[Verse 1]
You know the G code
Installed from young, that's street mode
Bally n' gloves for the creep mode
Yeah I'm famous but I didn't really get to leave road
G-Locks n' kilo's, spin ya' main plug for his reload
Mazza in Dubai, had to breeze home
Free my G's though, petrol n' lighter for em'
It's still anything goes with the bally
No more Ammi, just Cali
Just copped the Mac-y
I lost mummy from a young age
It gave me street rage, made me cop a cheap gage, ah
Ten box up on a week day, now I'm on a new page
New wave on a new aim, I've been savage from a young don, ah

[Chorus]
Long day, long time since I bun' one
I'm from a town where the cunts from
No whip but they have gun, niggas get dumped on
You might also like[Verse 2]
You talk shit, that's macka'
I'm a rapper, trapper, slapper find you with a tracker
And it's a mad life, I come through like a black knight
So high, sippin' jack life
Many things on my damn mind
Feel superstitious when I see one magpie

[Verse 3]
If you did me wrong in the past, watch out for the get back
I'm coming for your head back
Might say I'm mad but the grave talks back
Brought pain from my heart and my brain to the lab
Dinner n' dabs
Bruck pocket, runnin' from cabs
Finesse a brother for his slabs
But you better watch your back cah' the karma bites back
Big mula have you kissing on a strap
Been going none stop since my mum died
Never-ending pain for a long time, ah
Tun' big man through the hard times
Route to the top was a long climb, yeah
So savage from a young don, ah

[Chorus]
Long day, long time since I bun' one
I'm from a town where the cunts from
No whip but they have gun, niggas get dumped on
[Verse 4]
I couldn't help what I did
Seen blue lights, went down the wrong way
Mount the curb, then I ditched
That's life of a Stig
Dog van, X5, 335 X-Drive getting dipped
Big boy R1M, let it rip
Boom, bang, bing, getting hit
I've been blowing helicopters from a kid, no fibs
Out ere' tryna get it in
Young hustle from a young man
Crime pays but it got me locked up in the cold can
I made butter for the toast but it won't jam
Apna's and the Karla's til' a old man, ah
I said Apna's and the Karla's til' a old man, pussy
I said Apna's and the Karla's til' a old man
