Waitin' here for someone
Only yesterday, we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the Sun
Now I'm waitin' here for someone

[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinkin' of?

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancin'
Without you for the first time
My heart is hopin'
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause, if I'm bein' honest, I ain't over you yet
That's all I'm askin'
Is it too much to ask?

[Post-Chorus]
Is it too much to ask?

[Verse 2]
Someone's movin' outside
The lights come on down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And, oh, love, watch the Sun comin' up
Don't it feel fucked up we're not in love?

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancin'
Without you for the first time
My heart is hopin'
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause, if I'm bein' honest, I ain't over you yet
That's all I'm askin'
Is it too much to ask?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancin'
Without you for the first time
My heart is hopin'
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause, if I'm bein' honest, I ain't over you yet
My shadow's dancin'
Without you for the first time
My heart is hopin'
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause, if I'm bein' honest, I ain't over you yet
That's all I'm askin'
Is it too much to ask?
[Outro]
That's all I'm askin'
Is it too much to ask?
That's all I'm askin'
Is it too much to ask?47
