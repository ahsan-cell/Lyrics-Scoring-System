[Verse]
Hey, your love is so amazing
It's all I want, got a nigga faded
Shawty on fire, and she really blazin'
Flames Armageddon, yelling, "Jesus, save me"
I'ma take her soul if she try to play me
'Cause that's all mine, that's my lil' baby
I'm in all white, like the fucking '80s
Throwing up the Roc', like a nigga Jay-Z

Ah, don't play me, no, uh
No, don't play me, no, yeah, ayy
No, don't play me, no, yeah
No, don't play me, no
