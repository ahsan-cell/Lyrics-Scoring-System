[Verse 1: Yung Mutt]
Slumped back in the driver's seat
Blunt between my lips
I'm ridin' with a bitch that's high as me
She duckin' out, she tryna sleep
I'm duckin' out, I'm tryna see the road
But all I can see are four horsemen comin' closer to me
I think I'm about to die, we'll see
Swervin' on them motherfuckers, bitch, it ain't my time
Let the world blow up first
Then I might just close my eyes
It's all I really wanted my whole life
The universe won't notice
Bitch, you just another life
The sun'll rise, the stars have already died

[Verse 2: Yung $carecrow]
(I!) see the reaper creepin' as my blood is seeping
Sleeping deeper through the night, so I can face my demons
(My!) weakness seems to be that I cannot stop breathing
Death keeps cheating on my life
But on my soul, it's feeding
(It goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on)
Leading to the fleeting of an endless dream
Screaming and needing, yelling and pleading
That things ain't as they seem
In the cut, sneaking and tweakin'
Because I can't stop seeking this pain
This torture of horror that I'm always conceiving19
