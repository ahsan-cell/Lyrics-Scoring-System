Where are You now
When darkness seems to win?
Where are You now
When the world is crumblin'?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

[Chorus]
Look up, child, hey
Look up, child, hey

[Verse 2]
Where are You now (Where are You?)
When all I feel is doubt?
Oh, where are You now (Oh, oh)
When I can't figure it out? (Oh, oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I, I
I hear You say
I hear You say

You're not threatened by the war
You're not shaken by the storm
I know You're in control
Even in our suffering
Even when it can't be seen
I know You're in control

Oh, I, I
I hear You say
