All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you?
Everywhere I go, people stop and they see
Twenty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby, put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby, put your arms around me, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Dance little stranger, show me where you've been
Love can make you hostage, wanna do it again
There's no time to think about the starting or the end
We'll find out, I'm told, my mother, she told me so

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby, put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby, put your arms around me, baby

[Post-Chorus]
I just want to fly
I just want to fly

All around the world, statues crumble for me
Who knows how long I've loved you?
Everyone I know has been so good to me
Twenty-five years old, my mother, God rest her soul

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby, put your arms around me, baby
I just wanna fly
Put your arms around me, baby, put your arms around me, baby

[Post-Chorus]
I just want to fly
I just want to fly

[Outro]
I just wanna fly
I just wanna fly
I just wanna fly8
