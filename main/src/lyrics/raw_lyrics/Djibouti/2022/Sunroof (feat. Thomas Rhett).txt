[Chorus: Nicky Youre, Thomas Rhett]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blastin' our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're makin' me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes (Aw, yeah)

[Verse 1: Thomas Rhett]
Feels like a never-endin' summer with you
And surfin' after winter in the middle of June
Sunset, sunroof, suntan on you
Blue skies, green eyes, it feels like I'm

[Pre-Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
Drivin' down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind
Yeah, I'm feelin' like this might be my time to shine
With you, with you, with you
You might also like[Chorus: Thomas Rhett]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blastin' our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're makin' me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes

[Post-Chorus: Nicky Youre]
I got my head out the sunroof
Oh woah, oh woah, ooh
You got me stuck on the thought of you
Oh woah, oh woah, ooh

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Nicky Youre]
Yeah, we're drivin' down the freeway at night
I only got one thing in the back of my mind
(You got me stuck on the thought of you)
I'm feelin' like this might be my time to shine
With you, with you, with you

[Chorus: Thomas Rhett, Nicky Youre]
I got my head out the sunroof
I'm blastin' our favorite tunes
I only got one thing on my mind
You got me stuck on the thought of you
You're makin' me feel brand new
You're more than a sunshine in my eyes
