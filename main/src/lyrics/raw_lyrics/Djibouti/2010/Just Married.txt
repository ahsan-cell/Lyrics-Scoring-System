I don't think I lied when I said I wanted that life
Maybe I was too young to understand what I wanted to begin with
But babe, it was true, with all that I knew
It felt like forever, that December Two
A fairytale start, crossing our hearts
Rode off in a car that said, "Just Married"

[Chorus]
But I wasn't made for fixing a plate or keeping our problems buried
I wasn't strong enough to keep on with all of the weight that I carried
Yeah, it was love
Then it was just married

[Verse 2]
Long distance texts, make-up-for-time sex
Tired of asking when I'll see you next
I'm too mad to fight, so I starе and cry
At the picture of you and me wеaring white
Just married
Just married

[Chorus]
But I wasn't made (I wasn't made) for fixing a plate (Fixing a plate) or keeping our problems buried
I wasn't strong (I wasn't strong) enough to hold on (Enough to hold on) with all of the weight that I carried
Yeah, it was love
Then it was just married

It was a beautiful wedding
Sometimes I still taste the Veuve
And dammit, I wish I wasn't this ready
To undo I do

[Chorus]
But I wasn't made for fixing a plate and getting divorced sounds scary
But I'm just not strong enough to hold on with all of the weight that I carried
Yeah, it was love
It really was
Then it was just married
