As darkness unfolds
The air overloaded
My home is in motion
As darkness unfolds
The air overloaded
The sky stands in gold
But you ran away
You left me to stay
We see us in heaven,I'm counting the days

At the end of time, at the end of us, at the end of everything we had
Only faith helps you
Only grace can do
Only you can take the pain
Cause the end of peace is the end of life and the end of any happiness
Only love helps you only trust can do
Only you can take the pain of me

When thunder is calling i feel so alive
The very first morning, can you see the light?
But you close the door, to what i adore
We see us in heaven IÂ´am counting no more

At the end of time, at the end of us, at the end of everything we had
Only faith helps you
Only grace can do
Only you can take the pain
Cause the end of peace is the end of life and the end of any happiness
Only love helps you, only trust can do
Only you can take the pain of meYou might also like
