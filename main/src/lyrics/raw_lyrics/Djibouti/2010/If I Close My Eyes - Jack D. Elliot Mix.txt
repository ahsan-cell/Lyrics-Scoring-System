When you stop being lonely
Do you find yourself forgetting all the good times
I'll tell you what happened
When i stopped being lonely
I realized i could keep you here inside

...nothing ever comes complete w/o your heartbeat
Whenever sadness comes around
You're still the one who brings me out

You showed me
If I close my eyes
I can still see you right here by my side
Holding me tight
Whisper in my ear
Everything will be alright
Everything, everything will be alright
Everything, everything will be alright
Everything, everything will be alright
Everything, everything will be alright

I can remember
We would run for cover
When the rain came down
We were safe and dry
Holding you laughing
Until we went under
I love trading kisses deep into the night
Should have...

I'm closing my eyes
Just to see you
Open my arms just to feel you
Again and again
And again

I can see you
Still see me

Holding me tight
