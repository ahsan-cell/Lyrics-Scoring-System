Don't need no introduction, I'm a fool, uh
Schoolgirl, but I didn't make it out of school
Mama told me, "I done raised a fool"
But I didn't listen, I was optimistic
And now I'm in the studio, see no competition
They sneakin' and dissin', don't care 'bout them bitches
I had a dream of those Bimmers on sixes
Give me three months and I swear I'ma get it, ooh
Big money be the clique, you know we ball out
We do all the shit that you just talk 'bout
I left my ex-nigga in the doghouse
Two phones, I ignore all of his calls now
'Cause I'm up now
And they do not want to see this girl shinin'
Give a fuck now
You just say that you 'bout it, you lyin'

[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Fuck it up
Westside nigga, know we fuck it up
Dubs up high, you know we thug it up
If you don't get no ends, you cannot fuck with us, you cannot fuck with us
You know we drunk as fuck
Drugs in the club 'cause the plug with us
Them G's on fleek, you know I'm number one
If you don't get no cheese, you get no love from us
You get no love from us, you get no love from us

Fuck it up, girl, go'n fuck it up (Fuck it up)
This Patr√≥n, I got the devil in my cup (Fuck it up)
Fuck it up, girl, go'n fuck it up (Fuck it up)
Rich nigga, pay whatever for a nut, go brazy (Go, go, go, go, go)
Gotta keep the 9 on me, shit, some of these niggas brazy (Ho, ho, ho, ho)
Niggas say they made me, well, make another me
In that Benzo
Maybach, a nigga bought a limo
Thick, thick ass, got dimples
Fuck, then nut, shit simple
That's what I'm here for
I got sharks still out here, I'm a fool with it
This movie don't need extras, I'm too with it
Chessboard, you would think I move with it
I'm a builder and you know Bob keep a tool with him

[Chorus: Kamaiyah]
Fuck it up
Westside nigga, know we fuck it up
Dubs up high, you know we thug it up
If you don't get no ends, you cannot fuck with us, you cannot fuck with us
You know we drunk as fuck
Drugs in the club 'cause the plug with us
Them G's on fleek, you know I'm number one
If you don't get no cheese, you get no love from us
You get no love from us, you get no love from us14
