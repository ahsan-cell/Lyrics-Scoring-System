Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Girl, don't hide that pussy
You should be the type to provide that pussy
And let a thug hit it
You ain't gotta get dressed or do your hair
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
24 hours, 24 hours
You won't have nothin' on, for 24 hours

[Verse 1: TeeFlii]
Yeah, you would look good with no make-up on
Sex, sex in the morning
You ain't no good girl, good girl, you a bad girl
You ain't no side chick, you know you fine
You a thickie wit'cho cute ***
I know everywhere you tatted
We fuck then get some sleep
Wake up then do it again

[Chorus: TeeFlii & 2 Chainz]
Girl, don't hide that pussy
You should be the type to provide that pussy
And let a thug hit it
You ain't gotta get dressed or do your hair
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
24 hours, 24 hours
You won't have nothin' on (2 Chainz), for 24 hours (Yeah)

24/7 like the Waffle House
Three cell phones, still nothin' to talk about
Might pull your girl with the head nod
I used to off white like egg nog
My baby momma badder than these R&B hoes
Towel on the floor, looking through the peep hole
I ask them, "Who is it?", they say, "Room service"
Give me one minute, she gettin' her womb service (Damn)
South side nigga on the West Side
Still got a whole closet full of reptiles (Tru)
The nigga ain't hard, he erectile
And I just beat it up I need a hand towel (Ooh!)

[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Girl, don't hide that pussy
You should be the type to provide that pussy
And let a thug hit it
You ain't gotta get dressed or do your hair
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
24 hours, 24 hours
You won't have nothin' on, for 24 hours

[Verse 3: TeeFlii]
Walking around, combing your hair
And you know that I want it right here, yeah, yeah
Catch you out you can clean it up
Lay you out on that couch
You know you fine (You fine)
Got long hair and don't care
I know everywhere you tatted
Fuck then get some sleep
Wake up then do it again
[Chorus: TeeFlii]
Girl, don't hide that pussy
You should be the type to provide that pussy
And let a thug hit it
You ain't gotta get dressed or do your hair
Girl, I got 24 hours, 24 hours
It's just me and you, I got 24 hours
24 hours, 24 hours
You won't have nothin' on, for 24 hours73
