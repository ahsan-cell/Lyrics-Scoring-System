Tryna make a Mill like I′m sexing Meek (uh)
Got a good brain I'm a sexy neek
Or a sexy freak (yeah)
I got them all guessing
Got my focus on Jehovah that′s why i'm never stressing - I got
Too many bruddas that are tryna come through (ayy)
Said he loves p's he be in my zone too (woo)
Wanna get under my skin suttin like a tattoo
Like Canada im where they want to run to
But noo (no no)
Tell him bake off im tryna get dough
He reappearing left him back like Cole (back)
With my career man im tryna save souls
And you know that I pop cah im dishing out smoke (ah ah)
Taking over the summer
Anywhere I step im looking crisp like walker (mmh hmm)
I′m out of his range no rover
If he ain′t from God send him back to his sender (wooo)

[Verse 2: Rapstar Sandy]
Uh, I'll be curving you (skrrr)
Sit tight in my rear side view (uh huh)
My days if they ever knew
How I chop daily I dont mean kung fu (oooowahh)
I′m living life never better
Levelled up
Why these haters so bitter
Followers
Only make my cheques get bigger
Uh - now go check who's bigger (woo)
Run it up - know i love big bags
Hustler - I′m tryna get mo' stacks
Only winners here - and if you ain't with that
Better cut
Can′t build with me like plaque (hahh)
They know I got the juice call me Bishop
I see them prey on me their religious
Loving my waist my body a 8 figure
But I′m tryna get my bank account up to 8 figures
[Chorus: Shonté]
Slow down show me loving boo
You love my style wah you wan fi do
If i were you then i'd want me too
Switch flows no cuffing ill be curving you
Slow down show me loving boo
You love my style wah you wan fi do
If i were you then i′d want me too
Switch flows no cuffing ill be curving you
