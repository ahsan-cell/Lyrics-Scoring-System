What you doing with my head?
I may let you go ahead
But you gotta do it right, right, right
Show me that you'll make us spin
If I let you try again
Boy, you gotta do it right, right, right

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh oh oh
Come on over
Oh oh oh
Let's get together
Come on, turn the lights down
See there's no rewind now
Let's cross the line
Show me yours, I'll show you mine

Let's do it right (all night)
Do it right (all night)
Do it right (all night)
All night, all night
Do it right (all night)
