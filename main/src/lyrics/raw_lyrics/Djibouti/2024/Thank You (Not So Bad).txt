My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

[Build]
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It's not so bad

[Drop]
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so badYou might also like
