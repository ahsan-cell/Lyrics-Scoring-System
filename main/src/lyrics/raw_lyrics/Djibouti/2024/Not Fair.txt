Oh, he treats me with respect, he says he loves me all the time
He calls me fifteen times a day, he likes to make sure that I'm fine
You know I never met a man who's made me feel quite so secure
He's not like all them other boys, they're all so dumb and immature

[Pre-Chorus: Enny-Mae]
There's just one thing that's getting in the way
When we go up to bed, you're just no good, it's such a shame
I look into your eyes, I want to get to know ya
And then you make this noise, and it's apparent, it's all over

[Chorus: Enny-Mae]
It's not fair, and I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream
You never make me scream
Oh, it's not fair, and it's really not okay
It's really not okay, it's really not okay
Oh, you're supposed to care, but all you do is take
Yeah, all you do is take

[Verse 2: Enny-Mae]
Oh, I lie here in the wet patch in the middle of the bed
I'm feeling pretty damn hard done by, I spent ages giving head
Then I remember all the nice things that you've ever said to me
Maybe I'm just overreacting, maybe you're the one for me

There's just one thing that's getting in the way
When we go up to bed, you're just no good, it's such a shame
I look into your eyes, I want to get to know ya
And then you make this noise, and it's apparent, it's all over

[Chorus: Enny-Mae]
It's not fair, and I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream
You never make me scream
Oh, it's not fair, and it's really not okay
It's really not okay, it's really not okay
Oh, you're supposed to care, but all you do is take
Yeah, all you do is take

[Post-Chorus: Enny-Mae]
(It's not fair, and I think you're really mean)
(I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean)
(Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream)
(You never make me scream)

[Bridge: Enny-Mae]
There's just one thing that's getting in the way

I look into your eyes, I want to get to know ya
And then you make this noise, and it's apparent, it's all over
[Chorus]
It's not fair, and I think you're really mean
I think you're really mean, I think you're really mean
Oh, you're supposed to care, but you never make me scream
You never make me scream
Oh, it's not fair, and it's really not okay
It's really not okay, it's really not okay
Oh, you're supposed to care, but all you do is take
Yeah, all you do is take
