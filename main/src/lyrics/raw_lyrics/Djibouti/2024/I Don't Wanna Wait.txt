Let's make tonight the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait

[Verse 1]
Swimmin' in the deep blue
Got me thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just tryna dive right in
Wanna spend tonight like
The last night of our lives
Chasin' all the love we can

[Pre-Chorus]
And now, oh, I'm in a sea of lights
And all that I can see is you
And now I'm dyin' to feel alive
So baby, let's try somethin' new

[Chorus]
Let's make tonight the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait
Tonight's the weekend
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wai-ait
I don't wanna wait
Got no reason not to celebra-ate
Baby, I just don't wanna wait

Every right that feels wrong
Rather be with you instеad
There's somethin' 'bout it right hеre
Got me seein' so clear
Rainbow-colored skies ahead

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, oh, I'm in a sea of lights
And all that I can see is you
And now I'm dyin' to feel alive
So baby, let's try somethin' new

[Chorus]
