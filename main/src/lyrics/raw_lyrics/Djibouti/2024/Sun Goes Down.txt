Lovesick and drunk on a daybed, the ghost of you linger in my head
Missed calls, don't know why you left without a single word

[Chorus]
But when the sun goes down, I'm dancin' in your mind
And when the lights are out, you give me all your time
But then the sun comes up, I'm runnin' out of luck in the light

[Drop]
You only love me when the sun goes down
You only love me when the sun goes down
You only love me when the sun goes down, down, ah, down
You only love me when the sun goes down, down, ah, down
You only love mе when the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
Lights on, it's likе you don't know me, this silence leavin' me lonely
Killin' me softly and slowly, on and on and on
In the daylight, you're hidin', give me nothing
We don't align here, no, we don't

[Chorus]
But when the sun goes down, I'm dancin' in your mind
And when the lights are out, you give me all your time
But then the sun comes up, I'm runnin' out of luck in the light
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
You only love me when the sun goes down
You only love me when the sun goes down, down, ah, down
You only love me when the sun goes down
