Good night to the unliked in the night clubs
Ain’t got an idea? You should check your light bulbs
I’ma be on board till you rappers get your flights up
I’m in the class you was never in
I’m in the class—where the hell you been?
I watch them watch me settle in
I never pretended to be better than
A lotta y’all provide the same shit
And then they fuckin’ with mine
You don’t know nobody?
You stuck in the line
You flat out broke
So you be pressed for time
And I ain’t broke
And I be pressed for mine
Some niggas couldn’t take the career change
So they pressed decline
Shit, that ain’t gonn’ stop my shine
Except that, that man upstairs decided to close the blinds
If not the money, the cars and clothes is mine’s
And them hoes is mine’s
If any of those don’t exist might as well
Close the line
If you see, she’s on her way
Now who am I to judge?
The case is closed
And the fakes exposed
Then they turn back around like the place is closed
Then they keep goin’ like the brakes is old
My life is like a confession
It’s probably a lesson
After I tell y’all I be hearin’ suggestions
Some might think it’s good or a bad impression
Eff them, I R-Les them
Next selection
I be on my shit, ha
Fuck those who ain’t up on theirs
I know it’s all unfair
They get mad when I take them back to the crib
Show them how I live
It wasn’t a problem before, now it’s just that serious
It’s just that big
Pause. I don’t feel the need to brag though
Subtract it fast, but I add slow
Your best friends will take your career and throw it in the bag
And walk around let the mutha fuckin’ tag show
If you see, she’s on her way
Good morning to the ordinaries
Good night to the unliked in the night clubs
Ain’t got an idea? You should check your light bulbs
I’ma be on top— the hottest position ever
But a position that doesn’t last forever
Can I get some credit, but instead I’m getting debit love
Man, I wish you could edit love
I’ll settle where I want it
So everything: I run it
So I could say I done it
And still keep it a hundred
I’m good; I’m where that ass is supposed to be
Now the haters getting close to me
Females push-up with their push-up
Haters tryin’a punk me—Ashton Kutcher
Tryin’a get their name up, with a little spot in this rap game
Tryin’a keep their kush up, for realYou might also like
