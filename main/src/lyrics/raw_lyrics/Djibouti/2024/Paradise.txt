Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
So she ran away in her sleep
Dreamed of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise, para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh

When she was just a girl she expected the world
But it flew away from her reach
And the bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night the stormy night she'll close her eyes
In the night the stormy night away she'd fly

Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes

Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes


Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh
