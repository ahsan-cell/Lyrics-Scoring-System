Dance for me like one, two, three
Close your eyes and you shall see
Feel the beat, set yourself free
'Round and around and around for me

[Chorus: Zana]
Dance for me like one, two, three
Close your eyes and you shall see
Feel the beat, set yourself free
'Round and around and around for me
Dance for me like one, two, three
Close your eyes and you shall see
Feel the beat, set yourself free
'Round and around and around for me

You're wearin' that dress I like
You in thе flashin' light, flashin' light, mm

So won't you show mе what you got?
Show me what you got
(Don't act like you forgot)
I'm ready, you're ready
So won't you show me what you got?
Show me what you got
Don't act like you forgot
