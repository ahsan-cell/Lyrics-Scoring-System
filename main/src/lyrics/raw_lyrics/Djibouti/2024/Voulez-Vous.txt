Take it now or leave it (ah-ha)
Now is all we get (ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-vous (ah-ha)
Ain't no big decision (ah-ha)
You know what to do (ah-ha)
La question c'est voulez-vous

People everywhere
A sense of expectation hanging in the air
Giving out a spark
Across the room, your eyes are glowing in the dark

And here we go again
We know the start, we know the end
Masters of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

Voulez-vous (ah-ha)
Take it now or leave it (ah-ha)
Now is all we get (ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-vous (ah-ha)
Ain't no big decision (ah-ha)
You know what to do (ah-ha)
La question c'est voulez-vous
You might also likeI know what you think
"The girl means business, so I'll offer her a drink"
Looking mighty proud
I see you leave your table, pushing through the crowd

I'm really glad you came
You know the rules, you know the game
Master of the scene
We've done it all before and now we're back to get some more
You know what I mean

Voulez-
Now is all we get (ah-ha)
Nothing promised, no regrets
Voulez-
You know what to do (ah-ha)
La question c'est voulez-vous
Voulez-vous
Nothing promised, no regrets
