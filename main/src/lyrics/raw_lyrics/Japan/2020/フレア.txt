Fuck-fuck-fuckin' bangerz (Bangerz)

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"
Yeah, yeah
You say you love me, I ain't fooling with that
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack
One day he wants me
One day he wants me not
I don't do chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at
I can't be sittin' 'round hеre waitin' on a man
To tell me whеre the fuck my seat be at
Where Mike WiLL at?

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Fuckin' bangerz)

I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse
Where the dollars at?
I let her know the rent's due on the first
They can call the hearse
'Cause, if there's any violation, I go off with that
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog
(Why I need his millis when I got Billy on the speed dial?)
You know I'm on that "meow", quick to scratch your eyes out
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
The plane, boss, the plane

Had me a little bit dismal

Part II: Silversun Pickups - Lazy Eye
[Verse 1: Silversun Pickups, Miley Cyrus]
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this moment all my life
But it's not quite right
And this "real"
It's impossible, if possible, at whose blind word?
So clear, but so unheard
Bangerz, Bangerz

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting
I've been waiting for this silence all night long
It's just a matter of time
To appear sad
With the same ol' decent lazy eye fixed to rest on you
Aim free, but so untrue
[Pre-Chorus: Silversun Pickups, Miley Cyrus]
Everyone's so intimately rearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine
Everyone's so intimately prearranged
Everyone's so focused clearly with such shine! (Bangerz, Bangerz)

[Chorus: Silversun Pickups, Miley Cyrus]
Bangerz, Bangerz
Lost and loaded!
Still the same ol' decent lazy eye fixed through your gaze!
That's why I said I relate!
I said we relate, it's so fun to relate!

[Bridge]
It's the room, the sun, and the sky
The room, the sun, and the sky

Now, tell me how the fuck I'm in the wrong if I don't want the nigga and he still ain't fuckin' with the bitch?

All in her mouth like I kissed her

Bad bitches run in my pack, gang shit
Cartier frames, spot a bitch on some lame shit
Broke niggas all in my way, clear 'em
Chains ain't makin' no noise? They ain't big enough
Wildin', on a boat on an island
When I throw it back, bet I make him throw the towel in
I got a nigga, but I don't need one
He fuck up, I'ma have my fun
Teacup, I can fit a bitch in my purse
Which one of y'all wanna go first?
Spicy, ain't a bitch out built like me
I run shit, probably how I got a deal with Nike
Beefin'? You just mad we ain't speakin'
And I'm the one that put the roof where you sleepin'
Phoney, I don't need no new homies
I'm the reason all of my opps ain't homeless (Ah)

I relate to your kind, your design
Your devotion to wave
Get your brain on the prize
Then, dive inside

[Chorus 1]
Mindset of a killer
With your mind out of phase

[Verse 2]
It's a game that we like, we crave
Yet, nobody wins
Any way you decide, you try
But you die

[Chorus 2]
Mindset of a killer
With your gaze, you paint the room
Blood-red with your tears
Pouring from the stage

[Post-Chorus]
And you can't stop now
Rung by rung, almost out
Covered in black and gold
No one cares, no one knows
My gift to the world outside
It's okay, I'm alright

Here comes the fun, here comes the end

Click, erase the device, give thanks

Blow kisses, wave them goodbye
Goodnight

Pouring from the stage

Here comes the fun, here comes the end

[Verse 1]
Currently
The sullen look on your face tells me
You see something more pure in me than this dirty
When I'm
With you I no longer have tainted flesh
Where violation teared my dress before you
Took me away
I could not see past this horizon line
With my dying light that's overgrown with

[Chorus]
Thorny vines are piercing through
The only vein that's still okay
You let me cry, and wipe my eyes
And make me feel something other than
Desolated nothing
I am desperate in a nightmare
Where I'm trying to find you
In a maze with no staircase
I'm stuck and breathless
In the backroom of a spinning hall
Dizzy, I crawl and trip down
Fall again, you pick up all my guts
Spilling out, bruised up, bloodied up

[Verse 2]
Oh
I look into your eyes and see a bright white light
And you turn this horrible place
Into
Orange light, sunset in sight, you tell me not to
Be so hard on my own beauty
You still
Hold me even though I'm made of fire burning through
You hold me gently, but these

[Chorus]
Thorny vines are piercing through
The only vein that's still okay
You let me cry, and wipe my eyes
And make me feel something other than
Desolated nothing
I am desperate in a nightmare
Where I'm trying to find you
In a maze with no staircase
I'm stuck and breathless
In the backroom of a spinning hall
Dizzy, I crawl and trip down
Fall again, you pick up all my guts
Spilling out, bruised up, bloodied up

[Outro]
Suddenly
Curled up
In a ball
In the bathroom floor
Unconsciously, I feel you

Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know

[Chorus]
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know
The first cut is the deepest
But when it comes to being lucky, he's cursed
When it comes to lovin' me, he's worst

[Verse 2]
I still want you by my side
Just to help me dry the tears that I've cried
And I'm sure gonna give you a try
If you want, I'll try to love again, try
Baby, I'll try to love again, but I know, oh

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow, Jane Remover]
The first cut is the deepest
Baby, I know

Starting to see it in your eyes

And now, I'd rather know ahead of time

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl, summer just started
And we're already done

I follow one of your friends, you unfollow me

Said you want a simple life and that's not me
How you go from that to endin' up with someone just like…?

How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me
Don't have me wastin' my time

So much for that, girl

Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart
Breakin' my heart– breakin' my heart–
Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea–
Breakin' my heart, tearin' me apart

Brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea– brea–

[Chorus]
You said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

[Pre-Chorus]
How can you be angry on a night in July
And be warm with me when it's freezing outside
You're confusin' me, don't have me wastin' my time

[Chorus]
Yeah, you said "I love you" too fast
So much for that, girl
Summer just started, and we're already done

Part XIV: Madonna - Sorry
[Intro]
Je suis désolé
Lo siento
Ik ben droevig
Sono spiacente
Perdóname

[Refrain]
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before
I've heard it all before, I've heard it all before

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before and I
Can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say "Forgive me"
I've seen it all before and I
Can't take it anymore

[Verse 1]
You're not half the man you think you are
Save your words because you've gone too far
I've listened to your lies and all your stories
(Listened to your stories)
You're not half the man you'd like to be

[Chorus]
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say you're sorry
I've heard it all before and I
Can take care of myself
I don't wanna hear, I don't wanna know
Please don't say "Forgive me"
I've seen it all before and I
Can't take it anymore

[Verse 2]
Don't explain yourself 'cause talk is cheap
There's more important things than hearing you speak
You stayed because I made it so convenient (I made it so convenient)
Don't explain yourself, you'll never see

Part XVII: The Chicks - Landslide
[Verse 1]
I took my love and I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down

[Verse 2]
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love?
Can the child within my heart rise above?
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides?
Can I handle the seasons of my life?
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Well, I've been afraid of changing
'Cause I built my life around you
But time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older, too
Well, I'm getting older, too

[Verse 3]
So, take this love and take it down
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills
Well, the landslide brought me down
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills

[Outro]
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
Well, maybe
The landslide will bring you down

Spotlights (Spotlights), big stage
Fifty thousand fans screamin' in a rage
Bodyguards (Bodyguards) and limousines
This is the way I see you in my dreams
Paparazzi flash, a hundred pictures, all of you
Hangin' on my bedroom wall
I'm a kid again, I feel like thirteen
But I knew since we fell in love, girl, I'd be

[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie, baby (Oh, whoa)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph

I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are

Front row (Front row), there I am
Jumpin' and hollerin', wavin' both hands
Would you notice me (Notice me), little me?
Drove twelve hours, girl, just to see
Your pretty face one more time
(Bought my ticket, I was first in line)
This is a metaphor to show how I adore, you (I adore you)
Baby, I do

[Chorus]
I'll be your groupie, baby (Whoa)
'Cause you are my superstar (Superstar, yeah)
I'm your number one fan, give me your autograph (Autograph)
Sign it right here on my heart (Sign it right here, sugar)
Girl, I'll be your groupie, baby (Whoa)

And as your number one fan
I'll do all that I can
To show you how super you are

You're truly special, your love is legendary to me

I'll never leave your world, treat you like a diva, girl

Part XX: Mk.gee - I Want
[Verse 1]
You're the best thing I know
But late at night, I still question
All of my mistakes, mmm
Somethin' in my head wants to reiterate, woah-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
So tell me what you're dreaming about
'Cause I know that there's things you can't quite
Tell me all of the time
Every time you leave, a little part of me dies
But I want what I want
Yes, I want what I want
And I want
And I want (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
I do the best I can, you know
But lately, I am caught
Right inside of your line of fire
I'm not your hero
But I got his desire

[Chorus]
And I want what I want
Yes, I want what I want
And I want
Yes, I want what I want
And I want

[Outro]
But lately, I am caught
Right inside of your line of fire
I'm not your hero
But I got his desire
