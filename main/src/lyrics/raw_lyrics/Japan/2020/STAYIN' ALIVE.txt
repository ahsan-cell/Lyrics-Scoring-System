(Chapo)
(I'll blow your fucking head off)
Yeah, yeah
You ain't talking 'bout Glokk, you ain't talking 'bout nothin', nigga
Yeah

[Verse]
(Grrr, yeah)
Preying on niggas, we went to the tiger hunt just to get stripes
Big ass Draco, we made these lil' fuck nigga run for his life
Nigga got locked up, caught that month, but nigga just gon' be alright
I slay bitches like dragon, they call me a knight
I got vamps that ready to slide, they don't give a fuck if I'm right
When I was locked up for that [?], I put money on a knife fight
Nigga finna put his life in danger tryna beef with the mob, nigga, I don't give a fuck, boy, that's your life
Vampire, pop out at night
Tryna catch a body, tryna catch me a hat
G30 in the passenger seat
I'm tryna kill all thе rats
You ain't finna do nothin', nigga, stop that rap cap
Get this shit bustin', nigga, I don't do tit for tat
Nigga in the gang turned to a damn rat, call him molе rat
Nigga see the bag, nigga run a damn 4 flat
Bad lil' vibe, ass real fat
Nigga want mob ties with the vampires, nigga, it's a wrap
Nigga keep on dissin', we'll put his body in a shack
Send a blitz on me, nigga, I'm the quarterback
I call the shots, nigga, and you know that
Sumo on the video, bitch [?]
Catch you off guard, nigga, stay in your lane 'fore I catch you off track
I don't want your bitch, fuck nigga, she a gnat-gnat
Pass that ho to the swoop, she ain't comin' back
Nigga said he wanna get high, smoke his ass just like Angel Dust
Baby Life, vamp come through, more than one of us
I'll get a nigga ass stained for a honey bun
Seventeen years old locked in that dungeon
Vamp pull off, put a hole in stomach like Funyuns
Vampire fang, nigga gang gon’ gettin' ate like a Wonton
Baby Life Spaz, caught a shot like I'm Kim Jong
And these pussy niggas get stepped on, water bug
Pull out that Glock if you think I'm finna knuckle up
Pussy ass-nigga, man, your tail always tucked
Come to the function and act the fuck up
Shoot that boy, let them see ya face, take that mask off
Probably get killed, them niggas makin' sad songs
Pass to my patna, I ain't know she was a redbone
We smoke loud, man, we call this shit, "Headphones"
Hang with the apes, niggas call they ass bamboo
Baby Life vamp, break your neck like bamboo
Run that boy over, man, we gave his ass flat shoe
We draw down on an opp like a tattoo
I ain't never tell and these niggas spreadin' fake, fu
These niggas gettin' ate like chicken noodle soup
I drop the bomb on a opp like a nuke
I walk on the sky with the Glock like I'm Luke
Free trish, gave nigga missing tooth
Gotta stay alive, man, you know this shit difficult
Me and my woe 2Love, free JuJu
Watch your back, these hoes be cuckoo
Only with the mob, I ain't hang with no goofies
Glock hit his ass, give him different moods
Catch his bitch-ass, nigga better not snooze
Baby Life, vampire, fuck nigga, I'm the truth (Vampire)
