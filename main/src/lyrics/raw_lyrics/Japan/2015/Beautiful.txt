Looking in the mirror, staring at my enemy
Every day's a battle with the girl in front of me
I tell her that she's perfect, but she's no good at listening
Some days, it's hard to love her
She never makes it easy, yeah

[Pre-Chorus 1: Betty Who]
Those days, I just wanna say to her
"Girl, don't you know that–

[Chorus: Betty Who]
"On your worst day, you're still beautiful?
So goddamn beautiful
It's a feeling that you can't let go
Yes, you're so beautiful"

[Verse 2: Superfruit]
Aren't you gettin' tired, yeah
Of hiding who you're meant to be? Oh, no
Baby, what you don't know
Is you got everything you need, no

[Pre-Chorus 2: Superfruit]
One day, someone's gonna say to you
"Hey, don't you know that–

"On your worst day, you're still beautiful?
So goddamn beautiful
It's a feeling that you can't let go

Yes, love can make you whole
Now you're feeling it and watch it grow
Yes, you're so beautiful"
