Under pressure you are waiting for the direction
Going on the road without your mind
All mislead they give ignoring out all decisions
Killing yourself your soul we have inside
No one else but you are I'm waiting for
We can start it on just right here right now
Fear and circulation
But I am ready now
We can struggle and muzzle the world before it fades away

[Chorus]
Raise your flag
Koe no kagiri, koe no kagiri
Koe no kagiri sakende
Kitto itsuka, itsuka dokoka
Tadori tsuku to shinjite

Come on and raise your flag
So just raise your flag
Nando kujike mayoedo
Iki no kagiri tsuzuku kagiri
Yume wo mitsuzuke samayou

[Verse 2]
All mistakes I made are blurring my reflection
And it is more than I achieved so far
Taking this ship or not depends on your intention
To be the soldier or one bystander

[Verse 3]
When is the time ?
It's up to your own decision
The time to find
To struggle and prove our vision

When is the time ?
To end all the false collision
The time to find
And we'll move to the new division
When is the time ?
It's up to your own decision
The time to find
To struggle and prove our vision

So raise your flag
So raise your flag
So raise your flag
And we'll move to the new division

Raise your flag
Koe no kagiri, koe no kagiri

So just raise your flag
Nando kujike mayoedo
Iki no kagiri tsuzuku kagiri
Yume wo mitsuzuke samayou3
