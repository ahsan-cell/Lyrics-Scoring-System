It's been a long long day
Sunshine breaking through the clouds & watching me
I was sitting in the park
I was waiting for someone to take me out

[Pre-Chorus]
Sacrifice comes in a different package
I'm tired of living with pain

[Chorus]
Take me out
Hatred is blind as well as love
You have to turn hate to love
Get me out
From this world of anger and rage
You will find your way to heaven
I promise that I'll meet you when you're there

[Verse 2]
It's been a long long trip
Sunshine is setting in the west & crying
I was walking by the stream
I was conscious that strangers are staring at mе

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't look at me with hateful eyеs
I'm tired of living with pain
You might also like[Chorus]
Take me out
Too many tears stroking on my cheek
No more tears with regret
Get me out
From this world of anger and rage
You will find your way to heaven
I promise I'll meet you when you're there

[Bridge]
I heard too many people were crying for help
God forgive sins
Otherwise heaven would be empty
So wash away your grimy hands

[Chorus]
Take me out
Hatred is blind as well as love
You have to turn hate to love
Get me out
From this world of anger and rage
You will find your way to heaven
I promise that I'll meet you when you're there
I promise that I'll meet you when you're there1
