I don't know what it is that makes me love you so
I only know I never want to let you go
'Cause you've started something, can't you see?
That ever since we've met you've got a hold on me

[Chorus]
It happens to be true
I only want to be with you

[Verse 2]
It doesn't matter where you go or what you do
I love to spend each moment of the day with you
Look what has happened, you just walked in
I never knew that I could be in love like this

[Chorus]
It's crazy, but it's true
I only want to be with you

[Bridge]
You stopped and smiled at me
And asked me if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
Now listen, honey
You might also like[Verse 3]
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, can't you see?
That ever since we've met you've got a hold on me

[Chorus]
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You stopped and smiled at me
And asked me if I'd care to dance
I fell into your open arms
I didn't stand a chance
Now listen, honey

[Verse 4]
I just want to be beside you everywhere
As long as we're together, honey, I don't care
'Cause you've started something, can't you see?
That ever since we've met you've got a hold on me

[Chorus]
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
[Outro]
No matter what you do
I only want to be with you
No matter, no matter what you do
I only want to be with you1
