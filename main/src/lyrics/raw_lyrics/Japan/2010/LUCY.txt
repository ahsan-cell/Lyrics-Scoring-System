Hey!

[Verse 1/バース 1]
Baby, I'm standing alone
忘れぬ ´rainy day
あなたの影を追って
And it's over 砂のように
I sigh every night
I scream like a child and cry
靜かに漂うsorrow
Please, please God 罪を許して

[Pre-Chorus/ プリコーラス]
I don't need to hide no more
碧く光るほうへ
流れてく keep going on

You've got the chance now
You've got the power
氣付いてso true yourself
I show you my life now
I show you my love now
I show you my everything, yeah-yeah
Baby don't be afraid

[Verse 2/バース 2]
Baby, I'm lying alone
目覺めぬ drowning days
終わりの無い my misery
Now I know that 振り向かない
Life goes round and round
Just silence surrounding me
燃え盡きて like a phoenix
And I'm falling 奪われていく

[Pre-Chorus/ プリコーラス]
I don't need to lie anymore
搖れる波の樣に
生きればいい going on

[Chorus/コーラス サビ]
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now
變わらない, so be yourself
I'll show you my strength now
I'll show you my love now
I'll show you my everything, yeah-yeah
Baby, don't be afraid
[Instrumental/器楽]

[Chorus/コーラス サビ]

I show you my everything, yeah-yeah
You'd better change now
You'd better catch now
變わらない, so be yourself
I'll show you my strength now
I'll show you my love now
I'll show you my everything, yeah-yeah
Baby don't be afraid
