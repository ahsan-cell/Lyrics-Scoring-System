Without the light in dark
But I feel the deepest emotions
Throughout the fight with mind
I don't care about the lapse

Believe your voice and smiles
I'll be going there with my motion
Blow out the feeling dead
I don't care about the past

[Verse 1]
Killing the emotion of mine and I just use my mind
Forget my life
Apathy, impassivity and indifference of all the cautions to my life

You were alive and said
We're the ones who changes the world we know by our hands
You'd always saved, rescued and loved your neighbors as yourself

[Pre-Chorus]
Come and see just call my name
Kodoku ni wakare wo te wo hiroge takaku sora e sakebu

[Chorus]
Without the light in dark
But I feel the deepest emotions
Throughout the fight with mind
I don't care about the lapse

[Verse 2]
Sailing the emotion of mine
I go paint it black again and again
Scared by all the things I face and the future
That just leads to the white world's end

But you just took my hand
And you took me all above
We're the ones who changes the world
I close my eyes and urge myself to determine my faith, faith

[Pre-Chorus]
Te wo hiroge takaku sora e tobu dake
Me wo toji kokoro no koe wo sakebu

[Chorus]
Without the light in dark
But I feel the deepest emotions
Throughout the fight with mind
I don't care about the lapse
Believe your voice and smiles
I'll be going there to live
Nothing but the emotions in motion
