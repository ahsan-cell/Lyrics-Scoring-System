(Immortal)
(Maybe just for tonight)
(We'll think about tomorrow, yeah)
(When the sun comes up)

[Verse 1]
Must be something in the water
Feel like I can take the world
Throw the weight up on my shoulders
'Cause I won't even feel the burn

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn't try
These moments remind us why
We're here, we're so alive

[Chorus]
Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up
'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking 'bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

Clock is spinning, we don't notice
Fill this room with memories
Everybody's chasin' somethin'
But we got everything we need

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't be afraid to dive
Be afraid that you didn't try
These moments remind us why
We're here, we're so alive

[Chorus]
Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up
'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking 'bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

[Bridge]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
[Chorus]
Let's live like we're immortal
Maybe just for tonight
We'll think about tomorrow, yeah
When the sun comes up
'Cause by this time tomorrow
We'll be talking 'bout tonight
Keep doing what we want, we want, we want
No more wasted nights

[Outro]
I don't wanna wait, I don't wanna waste a night
I don't wanna wait, no more wasted nights4
