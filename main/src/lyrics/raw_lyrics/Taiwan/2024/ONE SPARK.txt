[Intro: Chaeyoung]
Ah, he-he-he
One spark, baby

[Verse 1: Nayeon, Jihyo]
Everybody wants that endless flame
식지 않을 everlasting blast
영원한 걸 염원해 그래 영원히, we're sparkling beautifully (Ooh)
아름다울 걸 난 확신해

[Pre-Chorus: Mina, Momo, Jihyo]
너의 숨결에 온기를 데워
계속 타오르는 energy
If I lose my rhythm
Then your beat goes on and on (And on and on)
Bring me the, bring me the spark in my veins
Give me the freedom, the freedom to chase
You know it's all ours
이대로 make this moment last

[Chorus: Nayeon, Sana, Jeongyeon, Dahyun]
'Cause my heart is burning, burning, burning
So good that it's hurting, hurting, hurting
눈부시게 아름답고 아프다 해도
It's our golden days
Yeah, my heart is burning, burning, burning
Don't lose this spark, baby

[Bridge: Mina, Sana, Tzuyu, Chaeyoung, *Nayeon*]
Lighting it up
빛이 나는 시간을 건너 (빛이 시간을 건너)
Glowing so bright
찬란한 환상쯤에 이르러

저물지 않아, there ain't no sundown
An everlasting spark to an everlasting fire
Don't let this fire die (*Oh-woah, burning on, ooh*)
