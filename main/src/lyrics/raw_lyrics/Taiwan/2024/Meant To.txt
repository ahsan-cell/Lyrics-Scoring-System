Your mother still calls me at 2 in the morning
'Cause I'm still up writing, it's bright in Wisconsin
If I break the silence, would you ignore it?
Did you lose the memories or are you still haunted?

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I am hard to figure out sometimes
I, I know that it's been difficult

[Chorus]
We can give it one try
Or we can let time
Do what it's supposed to
We can leave a light on
Dance around the kitchen
Or we can learn to
Go without the fire and the rain
And the midnight drives under stars upstate and the regret
But if we give it one try
Maybe this time
We'll be what we're meant to
Meant to

[Verse 2]
Been in a bad place, counting my bruises
Lost you to a heatwave and cracks that we fell through
Just brutally coating on breakdowns or breakthroughs
Some days I don't know who I am here without you (Ooh)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I am hard to figure out sometimes
I, I know that it is delicate

[Chorus]
We can give it one try
Or we can let time
Do what it's supposed to
We can leave a light on
Dance around the kitchen
Or we can learn to
Go without the fire and the rain
And the midnight drives under stars upstate and the regret
But if we give it one try
Maybe this time
We'll be what we're meant to
What we're meant to

[Bridge]
Meant to go the distance
Meant to let it be
Live in all the space between it (Between it)
Are we meant to find a new love?
'Cause it feels like losing
See you when I'm sleeping (Sleeping)
[Chorus]
We can give it one try
Or we can let time
Do what it's supposed to
We can leave a light on
Dance around the kitchen
Or we can learn to
Go without the fire and the rain
And the midnight drives under stars upstate and the regret
But if we give it one try
Maybe this time
We'll be what we're meant to
Meant to

[Outro]
Meant to
Meant to
