I got what you want, I got what you need (Uh-huh)
Mobbin' like we don't follow anything (Oh)
Left, right, get it on the floor
I wanna see you left, right get in my zone, ha
Then we hit the slide ready for the swing (Uh-huh)
We don't want no opps, want no drama queen (Oh)
Left, right, everywhere we go
We pull up from the left, right, postin' up slow

[Verse 2: Harvey]
I'm on one, got drip
Whip the ride, I'm switchin' lanes like this
Spinnin' out, then flip
Cruisin' down like we be on a trip

[Pre-Chorus: Juria]
Boy, just follow my flow, don't matter where we go (Oh, ah)
Oh, the only direction I know

[Chorus: Chisa, Juria]
Want your body swervin' left, right, left, right
I want your body movin' left, right, left, right
You keep me up, my heart is beatin' up and down
Spinnin' 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)
Just like my Pirellis burnin' on the ground
If you're down with me, then let's ride, let's ride
Can't nobody stop it, that's right, that's right
And my adrenaline is racin' up and down
Spinnin' 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)
Hit the pedal to the ground, listen to the sound
Listen to the sound

Now we onto somethin'
Drop the fit, we killed it (Oh)
Don't we all deserve it?
I'll tell you how we want it, oh
Left, right, you been here before
So do it 'til you get right, get it one more
No, you can't deny it ('Ny it)
Baby, don't you hide it (Don't hide it)
If I like it, I'll bite it (Bite it)
So just tell me if you are worth it
Worth it, really wanna know (Worth it)
I'll flip it and reverse it, sing it real low

[Verse 4: Cocona, Hinata, Juria]
Hold up, hold up
We goin' out, mixin' up these rides
Don't ask me if you don't know why
I hit the switch, hear the noise inside
Baby, say no more (Say no more)

[Pre-Chorus: Juria]
Boy, just follow my flow, don't matter where we go (Oh, ah)
Oh, the only direction I know

[Chorus: Hinata, Jurin, Chisa]
Want your body swervin' left, right, left, right
I want your body movin' left, right, left, right
You keep me up, my heart is beatin' up and down
Spinnin' 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)
Just like my Pirellis burnin' on the ground
If you're down with me, then let's ride, let's ride
Can't nobody stop it, that's right, that's right
And my adrenaline is racin' up and down
Spinnin' 'round and 'round ('Round and 'round)

Down, down, are you down, down? (Ah)
