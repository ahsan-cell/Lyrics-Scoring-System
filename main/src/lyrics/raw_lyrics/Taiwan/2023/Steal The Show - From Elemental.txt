Started out on a one-way train
Always knew where I was gonna go next
Didn't know until I saw your face
I was missin' out on every moment
You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two
Would you mind it if I said I'm into you? (I'm into you)

[Chorus]
So if it's real
Then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show

[Verse 2]
You and I, we go together
You're the sky, I'll be the weather
A pretty thing, the sun and rain, who knew?
Oh, yeah
Summer night, perfect occasion
Where am I? You know I'll be waitin' for you
Oh, for you

[Chorus]
So if it's real
Then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
So if it's real
Then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
You might also like[Bridge]
You shine, you shine
Like forever lasts forever
You shine, you shine
And steal the show

[Chorus]
So if it's real
Then, darlin', let me know
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
(Started out on a one-way train)
(Always knew where I was gonna go next)
So if it's real (Didn't know until I saw your face)
Then, darlin', let me know (I was missin' out on every moment)
(You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two)
(Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?)
I wouldn't mind
If you steal the show
