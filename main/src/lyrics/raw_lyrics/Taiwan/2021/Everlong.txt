[Verse 1: Dave Grohl]
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red, out of her head, she sang
[Refrain: Louise Post]
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

[Verse 2: Dave Grohl]
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you

[Chorus: Dave Grohl & Louise Post, Dave Grohl]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
[Refrain: Louise Post]
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do dododo
Do do do do do do do do
Do do dododo

[Verse 3: Dave Grohl]
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now, I know you've always been
Out of your head, out of my head, I sang

[Pre-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
And I wonder
When I sing along with you

[Chorus: Dave Grohl & Louise Post, Dave Grohl]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
[Spoken Bridge: Dave Grohl]
So, dad would take the Sundays off
And that's the only time he could ever get any rest
And so, because we were loud on Sundays
He'd make us hold his construction boots over our head, 'til we'd sleep
And they were really heavy boots and I used to say, "Dad, come on, please"
And like start crying, 'cause they're too heavy
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Dave Grohl]
And I wonder

[Chorus: Dave Grohl & Louise Post]
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when128
