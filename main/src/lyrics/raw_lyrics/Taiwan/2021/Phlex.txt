When you get upset, we're there to break your fall
And there's no reason yet, why they took your friends
There's no reason at all, at all
No reason at all, at all
No reason...

When you want to rest your head
On a shoulder that you know won't turn on you
We're all here, till the end with you
My friend, there's no reason to go
There's no reason to go, to go
We won't let you go, don't go
We won't let you...

(Not one day that you are here has been promised to you)

Not one day that you are here on this earth
Has been promised to you
So make the most of every day as if it was your last
And every breath as if it was the same, the same
As if it was the same, the same
Things will never be the same, the same
We will never be the same, the same, the same
Things will never be the same, the same
Never be the same...
