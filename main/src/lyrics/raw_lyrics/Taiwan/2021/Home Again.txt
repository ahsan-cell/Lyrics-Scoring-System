She asks when I'll be home again
If I could see those eyes
I know they'd cut me down a size
You're not here, when I need you

So sit, and wait
And bend, and break
You rise, and fall
Just you, that's all
I'm here, you're there
It don't mean I don't care
I'm so sorry,  I was miles away

It's been a day of tiny triumphs
It's been a week spent in despair
You can't send it down a phone line
I do my best, but I'm not there

So sleep, and wake
And dream up your fate
And rise, and fall
Watch you, grow tall
I'm here, you're there
But you should still know I love you
When I'm miles away
You might also likeI'll be home again
I'll be home again
Coming home again
Coming home again
