This time when I feel myself up in her
Even though I don't want to
And one side of me says kill her
But that just won't do
So I say we're through
So I say now...

Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
(I DON'T KNOW WHY)
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
(I DON'T KNOW WHY)

I think it's time to pack your things let's go
To a place where we both know
And don't worry, I'll drive real slow
Spend some time before we go
Spend some time before we go
So I say now...

Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
(I DON'T KNOW WHY)
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
(I DON'T KNOW WHY)
You might also likeGet up in your face with a sickness a quickness
Dialect I inject, will we be up top kissing all night
To make you feel right
So I say we're through
It doesn't sink in to you, oh please don't make me hate you

But that just won't do, so I say we're through

Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
(I DON'T KNOW WHY)
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
Stop and stare what the fuck you don't know me
(I DON'T KNOW WHY)
