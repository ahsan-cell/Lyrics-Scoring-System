[Chorus]
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another

[Verse 1]
Drink yourself more bliss
Have a stiff one all night
Everything is alright

Try and reach the bar
Coppers took the car
Offers from the sidewalk

[Chorus]
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another

[Verse 2]
Think I'm at full speed
Get it up the Coogee
Hello sailor cruising
Buy some Spanish shoes
Think I need a flannel
Get it at the cross

[Chorus]
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another

Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another

Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another
Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another

Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another

Drink yourself more bliss
Forget about the last one
Get yourself another
