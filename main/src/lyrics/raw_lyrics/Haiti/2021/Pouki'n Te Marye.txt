Yah
Y'all can't handle this
Little Jakey and the Mickey Mouse squad bout' to shut it down, baby
Team 10
Bunch of social media rejects
They assigned to take the paychecks

[Verse 1: Bart Baker as Jake Paul, Team 10, Eric Hennig as Bro 1, Erik Reedy as Bro 2]
I'm Logan's kid bro with the Disney Channel flow
By that I mean my rap skills suck, that's obvious though
I made a song so goddamn bad, it's Friday status
It makes all Jacob's music sound like Grammy winning hits
Yeah, we're like a semen stew, can't get whiter than us, dude
This is Team 10, bitch, we the zero talent crew!
Who are all these no-name kids? Nobody has a clue
What do any of you do? Leech off of your Logan fame!
I'm so famous, rich, and cool, Hey man, why are we called Team 10?
It stands for my IQ, his lyrics prove that is true!
Since I'm poppin on Youtube, I'll make crappy music too
With horrible flows and rhymes, Kit Kat's got more bars than I do
Couldn't think of a name creative like "Logang"
So just added "ER" after "Paul"! Wow that's lame!
Mentally I am eight; Maturity? No way
I'm Mickey's f***boy slave, this song just gave you AIDS!

None of us can flow
Talent? Not here yo
Without my big bro
My sub count would be zero!

[Verse 2: Jake Nunes as Nick Crompton]
You know it's Nick Crompton
And my mom's Mary Poppins
No, I can't rap, and yes, I do not fit in
England is my city, yes, I really am that dumb
I think England is a city
My jacket and pants guarantee I get no pussy!

[Verse 3: Tanner Kimberley as Chance Sutton]
Two months ago I wasn't potty trained
But now I got some fame
From riding Jake's nuts without him I'm washed up
In 24 months I'll be mopping floors up like
Damn dude, I shoulda stayed in school!
When they ask me what I do I'm 100 percent stumped
The sad truth in 10 years I'll be in AA
With all of my Team 10 mates
This song's a crime, we should all be locked up
Jake, you gotta stop grabbing your Disney nuts!
[Interlude: Kirill and Filipp Revega as Martinez Twins]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Can we switch the language? (Ya tú sabe')
We about to hit it (Dale)

[Verse 4: Kirill and Filipp Revega as Martinez Twins]
¡Sí! Ahora podemos hablar mierda
Sobre Jake y su canción y él no sabrá
No queríamos hacer esto, pero Jake nos obligó
¡Y él está tomando todo nuestro dinero!
Alguien por favor nos sálva, te rogamos
Esta música sopla y Jake es una ducha
Es como nuestro Donald
He burned both our VISAs
Y ahora estamos atrapados
En el Team 10, por favor, ¡mátanos a los dos!

[Chorus: Bart Baker as Jake Paul and Team 10]
None of us can flow
Talent? Not here yo
Without my big bro
My sub count would be zero!

[Verse 5: Alex Farnham as Tessa Brooks]
Yo it's Tessa Brooks
Blah, blah, blah, I'm Tessa Brooks
I rap 'bout Panera
Blah, blah, blah, I'm Tessa Brooks
Wait hold on guys, guess what?
My name is Tessa
Something smells bad
It's coming from Jake's butt?
[Verse 6: Bart Baker as Jake Paul]
It's coming from my butt

[Outro: Roland Luitgaarden as Greg Paul, Carrie as Pam Stepnick, and Bart Baker as Jake Paul]
-Alright Jakey, playtime's over
Time for night-night
All your little friends have gotta go
-But Daaaad
It's not fair, why doesn't Logan have bedtime?
-Shut your trap, you little brat
*farts and poops*
-Ahhh Jakey, did you poopy in your diaper again?
-Uh.. No I...
-Is that my Rolex?
-No dad please no, please, please, I promise I'll be a good boy
-Somebody's getting a spanking tonight, mister
-Why can't you be more like your brother?5
