A man so bad
I don't want more to waste my time always with you

And if you think to have me like a slave
You are wrong, my crazy man
Maybe you feel to be the first one for me
You don't know how many, how many men I had, mind yourself!

And if you think to have me like a slave
You are wrong, my crazy man
Maybe you feel to be the first one for me
You don't know how many, how many men I had, mind yourself!

You think to joke like cat and mouse and then to hit?
The poor mouse, crush it in your hands
Without the book

Oh my poor man, you don't know how much I hate you
You are wrong, my crazy man
Maybe you feel to be the first one for me
You don't know how many, how many men I had, mind yourself!

A man like you is not for me
A man so bad
I don't want more to waste my time always with you
You might also likeA man like you is not for me
A man so bad
I don't want more to waste my time always with you
