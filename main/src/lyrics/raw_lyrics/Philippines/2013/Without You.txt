Bucket full of tears
Baby know I'm here
I'm here waiting
Close your precious eyes
And just realize
I'm still fighting
For you to be with me
And sit under this tree
We can watch the sunrise
We can watch the sunrise

[Chorus 1]
Wake up feel the air that I'm breathing
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feeling
I won't go another day
Without you

[Verse 2]
I know it feels like no ones around
But baby you're wrong
Just get rid of the fear
Promise that I'm here
I'll never be gone
So baby come with me
And we can fly away
We can watch the stars shine
And baby you can be my love
Oh-oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Wake up feel the air that I'm breathing
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feeling
I won't go another day without you, without you
Hold on, I promise it gets brighter
And when it rains i'll hold you even tighter
I won't go another day without you, without you

[Post-Chorus]
And this is me tonight
There's no more games and no more lies
And I know it's right
'Cause of the way you look into my eyes
And when i hold you tight
The worries disappear, I'm glad you're in my life

[Chorus 2]
Wake up feel the air that I'm breathing
I can't explain this feeling that I'm feeling
I won't go another day without you
Hold on I promise it gets brighter
When it rains i'll hold you even tighter
I won't go another day without you

[Outro]
Without you
And I won't go another day
Without you
