You're a beautiful sunrise
You make my day so bright
Your smile is contagious
Such a cute surprise

[Pre-Chorus]
We're getting away, we're getting away
We're getting away
Life isn't so bad
Yeah, we're getting away, we're getting away
We're getting away
Such a good vibe

[Chorus]
Your smile is so pure, baby
You don't need a thing to be free
Such an inspiration, baby
You're more than anything to me

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
A beautiful sunrise

You are more than my coffee
That wakes me up so fast
All I need is your morning kiss
That makes my heart sing

[Pre-Chorus]
Wе're getting away (We'rе getting away)
We're getting away
Life isn't so bad
Yeah, we're getting away, we're getting away (Getting away)
We're getting away (Getting away)
Such a good vibe

[Chorus]
Your smile is so pure, baby
You don't need a thing to be free
Such an inspiration, baby
You're more than anything to me

[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la
A beautiful sunrise to me
