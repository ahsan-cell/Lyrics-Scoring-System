It's in the moments
When your face is next to mine
And we don't show it
But we're thinking of the times
So put it in motion
My desires taking over my emotions, my emotions

[Pre-Chorus: Ken, Pablo]
Want you in every way
Want you to scream my name
With my hands around your waist
Yeah, I li-li-like

[Chorus: Stell, Justin]
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
I'll be lovin' you baby all night
Baby you and me are shadows on the ceiling
That's my favorite feeling
Yeah, I li-li-like
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
I'll be lovin' you baby all night
Baby you and me are shadows on the ceiling
That's my favorite feeling
Yeah, I li-li-like
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Ken, Josh]
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la

[Verse 2: Pablo, Stell]
No, you don't wanna give me any reasons
Show me what you do, I'll keep it secret
We can't hide the feelings in between us
Just you and me, I'll never leave

[Pre-Chorus: Josh, Justin]
Want you in every way
Want you to scream my name
With my hands around your waist
Yeah, I li-li-like

[Chorus: Ken, Pablo]
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
I'll be lovin' you baby all night
Baby you and me are shadows on the ceiling
That's my favorite feeling
Yeah, I li-li-like
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
I'll be lovin' you baby all night
Baby you and me are shadows on the ceiling
That's my favorite feeling
Yeah, I li-li-like
[Post-Chorus: Stell, Josh]
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
La, la-la-la, la, la-la-la, la, la-la-la
Doin' what we do in the moonlight
