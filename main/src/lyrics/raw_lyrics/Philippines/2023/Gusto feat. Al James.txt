I am stunned, seeing you everyday
You don't even know I’m looking at you
You don't even notice me
Am I really just admiring you from afar?
I can't approach you because you’re too pretty
Just want to get to know you more
But I get shy in front of you

[Pre-Chorus: Zack Tabudlo]
I can't say what I want to confess
It's hard to say (Ooh)

[Chorus: Zack Tabudlo]
I just want to be with you
Until the sun goes down
When it's only the two of us
I can't say it when others are around
I just want to tell you
What my heart screams for is
None other than you, don't make this difficult
It's here now

[Verse 2: Zack Tabudlo]
Is this really real?
I kinda didn't realize it
I’ve known you for so long
From the start, it’s here now
It's hard to make it last
Because many people notice
They’re all starstruck
I can't blame them
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Zack Tabudlo]
I can't say what I want to confess
It's hard to say (Ooh)

[Chorus: Zack Tabudlo]
I just want to be with you
Until the sun goes down
When it’s only the two of us
I can't say it when others are around
I just want to tell you
What my heart screams for is
None other than you, don't make this difficult
It's here now

[Bridge: Zack Tabudlo, *Al James*]
Can't move a single muscle when you're next to me
I lose my bravery
When you come close to me, I become a coward
Should I just dream
That I'm with you?
I don't want to be alone anymore
Al James, let's go (*Yeah, yeah, yeah*)

[Verse 3: Al James, *Both*]
Nervous at first, planning to talk to you
Walking calmly but feeling dizzy
So many people I've talked to, you're the one I liked
Miss, I would make a way to get you
Only you and you alone
Even if our world is different, it's okay
Even if I get tired, you are my rest
We will welcome another day together
When I'm with you, I feel like I'm floating (Wow)
How happy I am, I can't measure (No)
My love for you is strong, got me thinking maybe you philtered me (Let's go)
Until now, her smell stays with me
*All my burdens lighten* (They lighten)
*Let's just keep on burning* (Keep on burning)
If all of this is a dream
When I wake up, I promise, the first thing I will say is
[Chorus: Both, *Zack Tabudlo*]
I just want to be with you (*Yah*)
Until the sun goes down
When it's only the two of us (*Yeah, yeah*)
I can't say it when others are around (*Can't say it*)
I just want to tell you (*Oh*)
What my heart screams for is
None other than you(*None other than you*)
Don't make this difficult
It's here now (*It's here now*)

[Outro: Al James, *Zack Tabudlo*]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (*Yeah-eh*)
*Yeah, hey, yeah* (Yeah)
