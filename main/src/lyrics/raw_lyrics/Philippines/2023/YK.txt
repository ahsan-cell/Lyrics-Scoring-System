Never thought about a day that I'll be needin' more
Of this feelin', I can't hide it to you anymore
The way you look, the way you move, you heatin' up the floor
Baby, you got that somethin' special knockin' on my door (Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, ooh-woah, oh)

[Chorus]
Baby, you know (Baby, you know)
Know I can't control, oh-oh (Know I can't control)
Can't handle this feelin', babe, stop teasin' me
No, I ain't playin' games (Ain't no playin' games)

[Verse 2]
See, I just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna see you go
Go ahead and leave me hangin', wishin', yearnin' for some more
I don't wanna lie, gustong mahawakan palagi mga kamay (Yeah)
Ang makasama ka, 'di ko na mahihintay
So I should go, ooh-ooh-ooh, I should go to you

[Chorus]
Baby, you know (Baby, you know)
Know I can't control, oh-oh (Know I can't control)
Can't handle this feelin', babe, stop teasin' me
No, I ain't playin' games (Ain't no playin' games)

(Oh-oh) Lately, I can't go to sleep
Thinking 'bout you at night but honestly
(Oh-oh) Baby, you my remedy
For all the pain that's hurtin' me (Oh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Baby, you know (Baby, you know) (Ooh-woah, ooh-woah)
Know I can't control, oh-oh (Know I can't control) (Hey)
Can't handle this feelin', babe (No, I can't, I can't, I can't), stop teasin' me
No, I ain't playin' games (Nah, nah, no, nah, nah, no) (Ain't no playin' games)
Baby, you know (Baby, you know) (Oh-ooh-ooh)
Know I can't control (Know I can't control) (I can't control, oh-oh)
Can't handle this feelin', babe, stop teasin' me (Yeah)
No, I ain't playin' games (Ain't no playin' games) (Ooh-woah)2
