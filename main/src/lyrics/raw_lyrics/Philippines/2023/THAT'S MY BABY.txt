Shawty so thick like filet mignon
Got me shouting her name on the megaphone
She be working that ass on the Peloton
Poppin' bottles on brunch, Don Perignon
She be smelling too good with the Jo Malone
Signature scent, no cheap cologne
Got me banging her line on mobile phone
Got me singing these songs like Post Malone
Hey, when I hit, can't quit it, I'll put you out, hoe
When I'm in it, dive in it, and stretch you out, hoe
Let me see it, go, flaunt it, and show it off, hoe
Take your phone out, and hide it, and turn it off, hoe

[Verse 2: Ivo Impreso]
Saturday night, got you feeling alright
Got the bottles on ice, got the red and the white
Got me high as a kite, got me living my life
With the music so nice while we turn down the lights
God damn, wanna get close to you
I just wanna go and build a home with you
I wanna lay down, front the fire with you
And spend summer in June, taking pics with you
Oh, yeah, I like it, uh-uh, I like it
This feeling, can't fight it, I just can't fight it
Oh, yeah, I like it, uh-uh, I like it
This feeling, can't fight it, I just can't fight it
[Chorus: Luke April]
She got a body like an animal
I'm tripping all night
Yeah, can I strip you down, baby?
Let me open your mind
Go put this diamond on your finger

That's my baby (That's my baby)
That's my baby (That's my baby)

Can you close your eyes?
Imagine how our life could be
Can you close your eyes?
Imagine how our life could be
Can you close your eyes?
Imagine how our life could be
Can you close your eyes?
Imagine how our life could be
