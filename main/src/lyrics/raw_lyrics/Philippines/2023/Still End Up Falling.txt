Hush now, little ones
I have a story for you
A story of men, and monsters
Long ago, two races ruled over Earth
Humans and monsters

[Chorus LEADER AND FLOWEY]
One day, they all disappeared without a trace!
[FLOWEY]
Howdy!
It's me, Flowey!
Flowey the Flower!
I owe you a huge thanks!
You really did a number on the old fool
Without you, I never would have been able to get past him!
But now, with your help...
He's DEAD
And I've got the human souls!
Boy, I've been empty for so long
It feels great to have a SOUL inside me again!
Mmm, I can feel them wriggling!
Aww, you're feeling left out, aren't you?
Well, that's just perfect
After all, I only have six souls
I still need one more...
Before I become GOD
And then, with my newfound powers...
Monsters...
Humans...
EVERYONE!
I'll show them all the TRUE meaning of this world!
Golly, if only you had Determination to fall back on
But you were too STUPID to use it!
But don't worry
Your old friend Flowey has worked out a replacement for you!
I'll save and reload your own death
So you can watch me tear you to bloody pieces over...
And over, and over!
What?
Do you really think you can stop ME?
You really ARE an idiot!
You might also like
While you had a pow-wow
I was feeling so proud!

Finding the means to an end
While you're making your friends!

Now their souls are mine, too
And it's all thanks to you!
Cause you took up his time
Gave me room for my crime!

Snuck right up to the king
Then slaughtered him, cackling!

There's no more time to cry!
Toodle-oo, kiddo!
DIE!

Huh?
WHY am I still doing this?
Don't you get it?
This is all just a SHOW
And we're playing parts!
I will destroy you
Shatter your worldview
Crush your pathetic dre-eams!
'Cause I am smarter
You're just a martyr
Now let me hear you scream!

You'll die for nothing!
Tearing you apart, what fun that'll be!

Cry all you want, kid!
I'll just enjoy it:
Making you twist and squirm

I took your save file
I'll make you watch while
Everything you love burns!

Why are you still fighting?
Don't you know I've won?

Come back every time, then
I've only just begun!
I can't feel anything!
No sense of empathy!
So yell at me, waste your time
Fall before my entropy!

You can never make me whole
You helped me achieve the goal!
Now at last I have the souls!
Now at last I'm in control!

Everyone said I'm insane
EVERYBODY DIES IN PAIN!
But now I've become a god!
In this world, I finally reign!

You have no idea what this is like!
I can feel the human souls wriggling inside me!
They're screaming in pain, just like you!
Wanna hear?
WANNA HEAR?!

Listen, they're shrieking
What little weaklings!
Dance to my puppet strings!

I'll use their power
This final hour
Service to their new king!

Am I too vicious?
Oh, how delicious!
Let's try another game!

The rules are simple
It's kill or be killed
Fight back or you'll be maimed!

I tried to warn you
Just a glance, and I knew
You'd be my chance
To change the game
You and me, we are the same!

Your DETERMINATION
Meeting my damnation!
The power to reset all
Stolen by your stupid fall!

That's okay; was kinda tired
All that DEATH, so uninspired
At least you're amusing
Even though you're losing!

What's the matter?
Did you fall down?
No, no, no... DON'T GET UP!

Clipping at the seams
Of your hopes and dreams
Unstitch the tapestry

There's no "bigger story"
Only the glory
Of my calamity!

I've got the power
The world I'll devour
Then make it all anew

Endless destruction
That is my function!
And it's all thanks to you!

This game is ending
Timelines I am rending!

Everything that I've done
Culminates in this run!

But when everything's through
I could not predict you!

Time for celebration
Of my DETERMINATION!

Ending this oration
With your extermination!

I'll be filled with such joy
When everything's destroyed!

Don't worry, kiddo!
This'll only hurt the first million times!
Wait, what's- What's going on?
S-stop!
Stop calling for help!
N-nobody's gonna come!
I'm the god of this world, you hear me?!
H-how are you-
What's going on?
Where are my powers?
The souls...
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
No!
NO!!!
You can't do that!
You're supposed to obey me!
STOP!
STOP IT!
STOOOOOOOOP!

[SOULS]
Hear our refrain
As we sing again
We'll write a new symphony

Lost in the silence
Used in his violence
We'll keep you company

[INTEGRITY, PATIENCE, KINDNESS]
He lost his way long ago

[BRAVERY, PERSEVERANCE, JUSTICE]
We'll punish him, even so!

[FLOWEY]
What is this?
You broke from my hold!?
Impossible!
I'll gain back control!
I'm your god, your king
You can't do anything
Anymore!

[BRAVERY]
Fight with DETERMINATION![PATIENCE, PERSEVERANCE]
Flowey
Stop this madness!
If you don't, you'll end up
Falling down! [SOULS]
It has been fun but now we're the ones
Who hold the determination
We've got the power, now little flower
Thanks to this human[FLOWEY]
No, this isn't right
I CAN'T LOSE THIS FIGHT![INTEGRITY, JUSTICE]
Flowey
Stop this rampage!
We will fight you, we swear
Stop this now![SOULS]
Freed from this dark cage, we'll stop your rampage
Protect the Underground
This is our last chance, we'll do one last dance
Now that we are unbound 
 
[FLOWEY]
YOU WILL ALL SUBMIT!
I WILL NEVER QUIT![BRAVERY, KINDNESS]
Flowey
You can't win this
Show your courage here
And we'll forgive[SOULS]
Your hold has been snapped, now we've got you trapped
Giving the human an opening
Blow after blow, your HP will lower
Now dance to OUR puppet strings![FLOWEY]
YOU CAN'T DO THIS!
I WON'T LET YOU![JUSTICE]
That was
Your last chance to
Turn your back on this path
And repent

Aiming
At your weak spot
They won't miss; 3, 2, 1
TIME IS UP![SOULS]
This game is over
We can get closure
For our empty deaths at his hands
It will suffice
To put you on ice
Before we must all disband

It's up to you now determined human
You've got the final blow
Unleash your power, on that flower
3, 2, 1, Let's go!6
