Broken all the pieces I've been shaping lately
Focused on the things that didn't make no sense
Guess that growing up was never meant to be easy
Yeah, I got used to doing everything sideways
Didn't really care about how anyone felt
Hiding my emotions down in different ashtrays

[Pre-Chorus: Maximillian]
Oh, but what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong
Embrace your flaws

[Chorus: Maximillian & Moira Dela Torre]
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I camе from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide thеse beautiful scars
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide (Hide) these beautiful scars

[Verse 2: Moira Dela Torre]
I went down a road that only got me nowhere
I've seen every corner, every inch of this place
Being all alone it really got me thinking, maybe overthinking

That what is lost ain't gone
No, you can't just let go
'Cause it's a part of you that will make you strong (Will make you strong)
Embrace your flaws

[Chorus: Maximillian, Moira Dela Torre & Both]
I'm not gonna fight back what I've become
Yeah, I've got bruises where I came from
But I wouldn't change if I could restart (No, I wouldn't change if I could restart)
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars (I ain't gonna hide these beautiful scars)
I've been going way too hard on myself
Guess that it's the reason I've been feeling like hell
But I wouldn't change if I could restart
I ain't gonna hide these beautiful, hide these beautiful scars

[Outro: Maximillian, Moira Dela Torre]
Oh, hi, aye
Hide these beautiful scars
Beautiful
Mmm
