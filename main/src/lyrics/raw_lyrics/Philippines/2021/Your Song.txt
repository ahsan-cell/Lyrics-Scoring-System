It took one look and forever lay out in front of me
One smile, then I die, only to be revived by you
There I was thought I had everything figured out
Goes to show just how much I know 'bout the way life plays out

[Chorus]
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only
One and only you, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Now I know that I known
Not a thing at all
Except the fact that I am yours
And that you are mine

[Bridge]
Oh, if you told me that this wouldn't be easy
And oh, I'm not one to complain

[Chorus]
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only
One and only
I take one step away
Then I find myself coming back to you
My one and only
One and only youYou might also like1
