First time I laid my eyes on someone like you
I can't forget the hour, that moment with you
Then I have realized, love's growing deep inside
I feel the beating of my heart

[Chorus]
'Cause every day, every night
I keep looking up the skies
And I pray that someday
You will wake up in my arms
And love will never end
We belong together, always and forever
Call my name and I'll be there

[Verse 2]
Spending my days and nights
Just thinkin' of you (Thinkin' of you)
How you make me wanna smile
With the things that you do (With the things that you do)
When will I hear you say? (Hear you say)
Love's coming on your way (Love's coming on your way)
And that you start to feel the same

[Chorus]
'Cause every day, every night
I keep looking up the skies (I keep looking up the skies)
And I pray that someday
You will wake up in my arms
And love will never end
We belong together, always and forever
Call my name and I'll be there
You might also like[Outro]
'Cause every day, every night
I keep looking up the skies
And I pray that someday
You will wake up in my arms
'Cause every day, every night
I keep looking up the skies (Looking up the skies)
And I pray that someday (That someday)
You will wake up in my arms
Oh, love will never end (Oh, love will never end, yeah)
We belong together, always and forever
Call my name and I'll be there
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
