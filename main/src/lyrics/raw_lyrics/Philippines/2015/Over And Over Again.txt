[Verse 1: Nathan Sykes]
From the way you smile to the way you look
You capture me unlike no other
From the first "Hello," yeah, that's all it took
And suddenly, we had each other

[Pre-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do, and I'm tellin' you
Just put your heart in my hands
Promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
Yeah, we'll stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again (Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh)
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Nathan Sykes]
Over and over again (Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh)

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
From the heat of night to the break of day
I'll keep you safe and hold you forever
And the sparks will fly, they will never fade
And every day gets better and better

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes, Both]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
Yeah, I'm tellin' you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
Yeah, we'll stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
[Post-Chorus: Nathan Sykes & Ariana Grande]
(Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh; ooh-ayy, ah-yeah, oh-ah)
Over and over again (Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh; oh, ayy-ayy-ayy)

[Bridge: Nathan Sykes & Ariana Grande]
Girl, when I'm with you (Boy, when I'm with you)
I lose track of time
When I'm without you, you're stuck on my mind
Be all you need 'til the day that I die
I'll love you over and over again

[Chorus: Nathan Sykes & Ariana Grande, Both]
So don't ever think I need more
'Cause I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
Yeah, I'm tellin' you
Just put your heart in my hands
Promise it won't get broken (I promise it won't, no)
We'll never forget this moment (Oh, yeah)
It will stay brand new, 'cause I'll love you
Over and over again, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Nathan Sykes & Ariana Grande, Both]
(Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh; ooh-yeah)
Yeah, over and over again (Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh-eh; oh-ayy)
Over and over again1
