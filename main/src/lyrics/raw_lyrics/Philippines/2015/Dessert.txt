Are you saving that dessert for me?
Cause if you are baby
You know you could work for me
The way you do it causing jealousy
But you don't ever gotta worry about the enemy
They try to do it like you
And they get mad cause they don't do it successfully
They try to copy your moves
But they don't never ever do it that tastefully

[Chorus]
They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
They can imitate you
But they can't duplicate you
Cause you got something special
That makes me wanna taste you
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's wrong
I want it all day long
I'm addicted like it's-
