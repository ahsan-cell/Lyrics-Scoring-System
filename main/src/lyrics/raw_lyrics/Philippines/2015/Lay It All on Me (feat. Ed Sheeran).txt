(If you're hurting)
(If)
(If you're hurting)

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
All alone as you look through the door
Nothing left to see
If it hurts and you can't take no more
Lay it all on me

[Pre-Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
No you don't have to keep it under lock and key
'Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape all your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

[Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
You can lay it all on me
Yeah you can lay it all on me (Lay it all on me)
You can lay it all on me
Lay it all on me

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
If you're scared when you're out on your own
Just remember me
'Cause I won't let you go in alone
Lay it all on me

[Pre-Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
No you don't have to keep it under lock and key
'Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape all your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

[Chorus: Rudimental & Ed Sheeran]
Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
You can lay it all on me
Yeah you can lay it all on me (Lay it all on me)
You can lay it all on me

[Bridge]
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me

[Outro]
