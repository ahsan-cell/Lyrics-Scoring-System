Ride with my woes
I don’t fuck with no hoes
I’m only falling for those eyes
I just wanna know, right
Come vibe with me
Tell me you’re the one for me
Pull up on you late night, all the drinks on me
Just hit me on my line, that’s how its ‘posed to be
When the money makes you blind, you know who to see
Goddammit, I knew it, I’m falling for you
Just know that I’m hoping you' feelin’ it too

[Chorus: Matthaios]
Come vibe with me when you are free
Call me when it's three
You don't have to tell nobody that you're comin' home with me
Come vibe with me when you are free
Call me when it's three
You don't have to tell nobody that you're comin' home with me
