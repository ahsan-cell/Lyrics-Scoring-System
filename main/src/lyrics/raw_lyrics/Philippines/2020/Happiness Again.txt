Never thought I'd feel this way again
I'm lost without you
Always thought I'd have you in my arms
I'm nothing without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Days are darker, nights are colder, now
Drinks are stronger, my bones feel weaker, now

[Chorus]
I need to find a way to happiness again, oh Lord
I need to find a way to happiness again, oh Lord
I need to-

[Drop]
I need to find a way, find a way
Find a way, find a way to live without you

[Verse 2]
I never thought I'd be alone again
I'm lost without you
I always thought that we'd stay hand in hand
I'm nothing without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Days are darker, nights are colder, now
Drinks are stronger, my bones feel weaker, now
You might also like[Chorus]
I need to find a way to happiness again, oh Lord
I need to find a way to happiness again, oh Lord
I need to-

[Drop]
I need to find a way, find a way
Find a way, find a way to live without you

[Bridge]
Happiness again is all I need
But I don't wanna let go
'Cause we were made of dreams
Happiness again is all I want
But with me you can't be happy
So I guess you will move on

[Chorus]
I need to find a way to happiness again, oh Lord
I need to find a way to happiness again, oh Lord1
