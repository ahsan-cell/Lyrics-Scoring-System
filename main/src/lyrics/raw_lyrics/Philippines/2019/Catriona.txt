Matthaios be wonderin'

[Chorus]
I love the way she makes me smile, she makes me smirk (yes, sir)
It gives me chills, it makes me blush, it gives me worth (worth)
And I can see her winning the Miss Universe
And if heaven does exist it will most prolly look like her, yeah
I love the way she makes me smile, she makes me smirk (yes, sir)
It gives me chills, it makes me blush, it gives me worth (worth)
And I can see her winning the Miss Universe
And if heaven does exist it will most prolly look like her (switch it up, switch it up)

[Verse 1]
May babae ako nakitang kay ganda (shit)
Yung mga mata niya ay bibihagin ka (patay na)
Pag tumingin ka sakanya ay 'matic na
Parang pinana ka ni Kupido, sapul na sapul ka (yuh, yuh)
Yung mga lakad niya ay grabe talaga
Pag umikot siya, sure ball maaakit ka
Dagdag pa diyan ang ngiti niya
Pag tiningnan ka pa niya, sure na sure na finish ka

[Chorus]
I love the way she makes me smile, she makes me smirk (yes, sir)
It gives me chills, it makes me blush, it gives me worth (worth)
And I can see her winning the Miss Universe
And if heaven does exist it will most prolly look like her, yeah
I love the way she makes me smile, she makes me smirk (yes, sir)
It gives me chills, it makes me blush, it gives me worth (worth)
And I can see her winning the Miss Universe
And if heaven does exist it will most prolly look like her (switch it up, switch it up)

Manalo o matalo, 'kaw pa rin ang reyna ko
Para ka lang si Kuya Wil, win na win sa puso ko (yuh-yeet)
Hindi kita kailangan ikumpara kasi ikaw lang baby at wala na ngang iba (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Pag tumawa ka (ooh), nakakatunaw na (yes sir) parang sorbetes na iniwan sa labas, 'di ba? (hmm)
Kung ako na nga ang papipiliin, panalo ka na 'matic, pwede mo pa 'kong alipin (aye)

[Chorus]
I love the way she makes me smile, she makes me smirk (yes, sir)
It gives me chills, it makes me blush, it gives me worth (worth)
And I can see her winning the Miss Universe
And if heaven does exist it will most prolly look like her, yeah
I love the way she makes me smile, she makes me smirk (yes, sir)
It gives me chills, it makes me blush, it gives me worth (worth)
