I'd wait on you forever and a day
Hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you're ever gon' get any less than you should

[Chorus]
'Cause baby
You smile, I smile, oh
'Cause whenever you smile, I smile
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know
I'm always gonna do what they say, hey
If you need me, I'll come running from a thousand miles away

[Chorus]
When you smile, I smile
Oh woah
You smile, I smile, hey

[Verse 3]
Baby, take my open heart and all it offers
'Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more

You smile, I smile, make me smile, baby

[Bridge]
Baby, you won't ever want for nothing
You are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
'Cause my cards are on the table and I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish cause it's my command, hey hey hey

[Chorus]
You smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, hey, hey, hey
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh
