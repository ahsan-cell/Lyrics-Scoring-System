(Two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
I was closing all the blinds
Just so you could sleep the night through
I was staying by your side
Just so I knew you were okay
And I was opening the door
Just to see if you would walk through
I started painting all the walls
Just to see if you liked the shade

[Chorus]
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)
It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)

[Verse 2]
You were holding out your hands
Hoping I'd be there to hold to
I went out to Amsterdam
Just so I could givе you some space
But I kept opеning my door
Just to see if you would walk through
But now I'm painting all my walls
Just to see if you like the shade

I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else
It's enough just to keep us occupied
Please don't go
I would love just to be stuck to your side
Not with anybody else, anybody else (Don't go)
It's enough just to keep us occupied (Please don't go)

[Outro]
Not with anybody else, anybody else
Please don't go
Not with anybody else, anybody else, no
Please don't go4
