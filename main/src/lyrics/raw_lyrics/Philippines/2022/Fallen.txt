What if I told you that I've fallen?
And I like the way you say my name
My heart skips a beat when I hear you calling
And I like that it won't go away

[Verse 2]
But never mind, don't wanna give you any trouble
Never mind, never mind
I'm okay with being by your side for as long as I can hide
What if I told you that I've fallen?

[Verse 3]
What if I told you that I've fallen?
A heart shaped arrow through my chest
I'll make your breakfast every morning
And pick you up when you're a mess

[Verse 4]
I know that it won't ever stop
You know I'll be there when you call me whеther you like it or not
Without a warning, now I'm falling for this picture on my phonе
But don't mind me I'm just falling, I'll get back up on my own
Please don't say my name, help me put out this flame
I'd rather hold onto this feeling that you don't even believe in
What if I told you that I've fallen?

[Bridge]
What if I told you that I've fallen?
(Never mind, never mind, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen?
(Never mind, never mind, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen?
(Never mind, never mind, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen?
(Never mind, never mind, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)
What if I told you that I've fallen? (Oh, never mind)

[Outro]
I said never mind (I shouldn't tell you that I've fallen)
