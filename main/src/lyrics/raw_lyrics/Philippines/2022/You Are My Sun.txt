For the past couple years I’ve seen tragedy at max
It’s getting dark I hope my shadow can adapt
Family home went from a palace to a shack
Dilapidated castle to a trap
Daddy never had me on his lap
So when a male authority figure at me I’m casually reacting with attack
I’ve always been this talented at rap
Only recently are niggas on me like I got a saddle on my back
Eve got her mouth on me like an apple in my sac
Fully automatic chopping how I’m hacking with the MAC
Mister robot with data I extract, trafficking the packs
On the block chain ain’t no tracking me on that
Travel back to Africa and back
With the artifacts, blueprints, papyrus and maps
I'm like Indiana Jones but if Harrison was Black
I’m just trying to keep my heritage intact
Electron, Effects on
Gen-etics long, 10x strong
Rocks wilder than Red Meth song, vest Teflon
Red Fez, sekmet spawn, techs get drawn
Slaughter pigs on this redneck farm
Wake them up with a Fed Ex bomb
Separate head, neck, arm, chest, legs gone
Body parts everywhere like on Sex Ed walls, medics called
World looking like the next red dawn
Smoke gas to the face like my head chevron it’s Cameron
Aleon, I’m beyond luck
Me on beyond Elon Musk
Me on beyond aeon flux
Breed all seed all queens I fucks
Evolving all thing I touch
Me on see-saw fling y’all up. up
See Mars, see stars, see stardust
See me in everybody, Murphy on Klump, yup
One Pac, Tupac, three Pac, none-chuck
Bruce Lee, Ali I punch, duck
Short arms can’t box with God
My arms long enough to beat god up if he got shrunk
LSDMT I puff out cloud that I be on
And pee on Trump
I’m the bully in the back of the retard bus
In front of a starving man I eat my lunch
Munch grey poupon, dijon brunch
So many slaves I don't need my thumbs
Press tab on tongue like a Reebok pump, jump
Jew man, jumanji on mush
John D. on dust, all this money I touch
It should read in me I trust

Mother moon
Coat my throat with spirits that can only be found at the palms of dead legends

That now live in the cosmos
For far too long we have buried our rites in this western plight to fly amongst stars

And stand besides czars
At costs too high to land softly;

We have forgotten we are luminous, rousing lunar gods under one God
We must go back, we must go back to get tomorrow right
Young man

Light a match

Start a fire and burn;
You are the sun my moonpie will soothe

Abandon all biased system functions
And welcome to the introduction
An LSD induction
We are now at Cameron junction
This art serves as a spiritual function
Sun, son, son…
