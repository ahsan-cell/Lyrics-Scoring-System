[Verse 1]
True, it's a dance, we know the moves
The bow, the dip, the woo
Though the words are true
The state is old news

[Refrain]
Wrap me in your arms
I can’t feel it, but
Rock me in your arms
I can't feel it, but

[Chorus]
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change

[Verse 2]
I know my words will dry upon the skin
Just like a name I remember hearing
You might also like[Verse 3]
Wild winters, warm coffee
Mom’s gone, do you love me?
Blazing summer, cold coffee
Baby's gone, do you love me?

[Refrain]
Wrap me in your arms
I can't feel it, but
Rock me in your arms
I can't feel it, but

[Chorus]
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment's the same, but the pair of feet change
[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
My baby does the hanky-panky
My baby does
(Wrap me, in your arms)
My baby does the hanky-panky
(I can't feel it, but)
My baby does
(Rock me, in your arms)
My baby does the hanky-panky
(I can't feel it, but)
My baby does

[Chorus]
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Feel the turn of rotation and stop
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment’s the same, but the pair of feet change
Get up, get down
And you move it all around now
Get up
See the next one waiting
Get up, get down
Get up, get down
Get up
Sentiment’s the same, but the pair of feet change29
