Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year, that's not original
Or cynical, alright, let's go now

[Chorus]
When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say I know, you know it's over

[Verse 2]
Play it cool, I just want the keys back to my vehicle
They're just gonna tell you that it wasn't real
And I just wanna tell you this is how I feel
I know you feel, I know you feel it too

[Chorus]
When all your dreams are gone
And you're still holding on
You waited far too long
Don't say I know, you know it's over

[Verse 3]
Casio, playing on my heart just like a Casio
Breaking it apart so you can let it go
Wait another year, that's not original
Or cynical, alright, let's go now

Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now
Don't think that my love is gone
It's all up in your head now (Alright, let's go now)
