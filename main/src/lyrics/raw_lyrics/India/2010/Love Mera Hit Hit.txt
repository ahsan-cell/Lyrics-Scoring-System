Snorlax in my way but, nigga, that ain't even stoppin' me
Incense on my shirt, it's crazy how these bitches flock to me (Woo)
The flow shocking like a Rotom in your TV
Encore on my verse 'cause you gon' leave my shit on repeat (Yeah)
I'm headed to the top, you gon' need Future Sight to see me
My team is too strong, you don't wanna see the CP (No)
Boy, this the Pokémon Cypher
You don't feel this shit then you's a motherfuckin' liar
Bars hit you heavy, leave you lookin' like a Psyduck (Yeah)

And you knowing you the greatest when they Mimikyu
Run this shit, hold B, got my tennis shoes
I'm coming back like a U-turn
Bite a nigga's style, get your mothafuckin' tooth hurt
No hands like a Wooper
The way a nigga dazzling, I'm leaving unaffected
If you really wanna shoot first
The freshest up in Lumiose, it's all in my clothes
I'm throwing balls at your chick like Pokémon Go
She a Tropius, I put banana all in her throat
We got a team of legendaries but don't nobody know
And you already know, I got the Dex, let me get 'em
Snatch your chick and then I get the pussy hot, that's Litten
Cold, I need mittens
Soundproof, I don't listen
You ain't talking money, get Amnesia, I forget 'em
Battle anybody, win, oh, you don't even wanna press start
Hit a couple times and now you looking like a Wimpod
You losing, I'm winning, you don't understand it
Spit poison, I'm fire, I look like Salandit
My style, my swagger, too much for you randoms
My arms on your head now you look like a rabbit
The bars so ugly like a Palpitoad
Bitch, I'm hotter than the sun, Solgaleo
I got an Alpha flow, I put you in the ground with it
Choose a path to go, boy, if I'm on it you'll regret it
Hazards gone, I'm rapid spinning, acid spitting on you niggas
My venom burn through your denim 'til you looking like a Drifblim (Drifblim, Drifblim, Dri-Dri-Drifblim, Drifblim, Dri-Dri-Driflblim, Driblim, Drifblim, Drifblim, Drifblim, Drifblim, Dri-Dri-Drif...)
[Verse 3: Scoot]
Ivysaur, number two, I'm the shit, boy
Triple it and I'm number six, Fire Spin's when I spit, boy
Viola late, no X and Y
That black man don't need to fly
Them fairy types all gotta die
Slurpuff, Unburden, prioritize
Scrafty dude, attitude
Weak dudes, Mirror Moves
You lose, Ice Cubes
Vanilluxe, double scoop
I'm a fucking fool, Mime Jr. mood
Niggas running up got loose screws
Magnemite, Electrike, spark the blunt Drifblim, I'm high
Twisted, I'm lifted
Don't miss it, I'm Swiftness
You tempted to Run Quick
Sick shit, it's Litwick

Rowlet, he clean as fuck
Bowtie, nigga, what's up?
Yungoos, mean mug
Grubbin, I'm the plug
Pikipek got the secret tech
No mouth, just respect
Lunala eclipsing, that Moongeist be ripping
Solgaleo be tripping, on the sun he sipping
This that O.T., you can say a Dialga over me
Palkia, give me space, no reaching in, I got Deoxys-D
Move your feet, no Hitmonlee
You can't Mimic me, you Sudowoodo tree
Mean Look, don't try to flee
'Cause you inhale like a Stockpile 3
Swallow your pride, bow down, I'm royal
Scalding hot, overflowing, that's boil
Servine, thirty-six, that's Coil
Exeggcute, rotten eggs spoil
Loyal, like Jenny's K-9
I get tail like the fox, all nine
I shine like a chain of forty
My Pokés are rare and always on Jolty
[Verse 4: PokeaimMD]
J my name is Joey, battles what I go about
Miltank the mascot, swerve when I Rollout
Nasty as a Muk smell when it comes to bars
A Sky Uppercut will leave you floating with the stars
Pokeaim's the channel, ain't nobody cooler
So damn strong that I'm way beyond Ubers
It's too damn easy, I'm the guy not to mess with
Cause every damn move I use is super effective
Young Strong Jaw chomping for the bread
Tried to hit me with your best, didn't matter, knew your spread
Like a roaming legendary we ain't battle cause you fled
Boy you lucky that I didn't drop a Draco on your head
Mega Eon, ain't nobody flyer
Yawn 'til I Snore you got me bored so I'm tired
Didn't even need a full party with me to beat ya
I'm hungry pardon me while I go heat these fajitas
[Verse 5: Haydunn]
They call me Haydunn and they hatin' but I said that before
Now y'all looking like you never seen my level before
If bars are what I owe you in a battle that's a nice try
I'll end you, 6-0, get rid of your Wi-fi
I run the meta, if you ain't know this then give it up
I stay on my last form, you play in Little Cup
Open up your storage cause your new teams fell
It's always competitive season and you seeing L's
Riding around on that Goat
I Surf never no boat
I'll make your whole team Dive, drown, if you tryna stay float
I be rolling through my region all alone, I don't roll with y'all
New Bike, that's a hot rod like a Ponyta
I got the moves you couldn't learn with a TM
Dittos try to copy but they can never be him
2016 go hard as Roggenrola
'Til it's time to kick back and vacation in Alola

[Interlude: Shofu Tha Beatdown]
What's popping with it, Shofu Tha Beatdown
Hair on top of my head only, Pidgeot
Dark and I'm fly, head Honchkrow, let's get it (Team Mystic)
B-E-A-T-D-O-W-N, get 'em
[Verse 6: Shofu Tha Beatdown]
You can't get rid of me
Everybody's feeling me
Three years saving up all this Octillery
I had to make your girl screech louder than a bat goes
Matter fact I had to strike twice 'cause I Zapdos
Thunderbolts I eat 'em up, you can call it Thunder Fang
I'm so cold you say my name your teeth freeze, Ice Fang
Bite your girl's neck she gets hot, Fire Fang
Look at me I Carey this team like Mariah's name
Pokémon games I played right
Heart so Dark I make Eevee an Umbreon in daylight
She can see my nuts for the first time, Premier Balls
Rhymes so sick, you'd think I had a Sheer Cold
K.O.!
Rampardos would be jealous of me
Because I got a big forehead, I give a mean Headbutt
You's a little homie, brown-nosing that's a Headbutt
She gave me top and bottom, we call that a Headbutt
P-O-K-E-M-O-N, I'm fly Moltres
I stay above the ground like Ghost legs
Me and my bros flex
Skill level isn't too common like brown pigeons
Cross chop a Miltank on its side like I'm cow tipping
Flow ill, I need to get that shit sterilized
When I use Lick she don't get Paralyzed
They call me Beatdown cause I make sure that my power felt
I'm way stronger than Machoke I ain't wearing no Power Belt
Getting coins is prevalent
You ain't us, you ain't relevant
Came in this thing Krumping, arms swinging like an Elekid
Y'all said I couldn't rap before but now I do this
Still wanna hate? S-H-O-F-U then
B-B-B-B-B-B-Beatdown and I'm back
I'm using Earthquake, you going underground to attack
I know you Dig me, West Side, Shofu Squad
Buh b-b-b-buh b-b-b-buh buh buh bitch!

[Interlude: Trickywi & Shofu]
Take my hand and dance with me
We'll start slowly, dare to proceed? (Get 'em)

[Verse 7: Trickywi]
I'll make 'em bow in the day and the dark night
Gold or Silver I am draped in the moonlight
I have a lot to show and I'll have the final blow
Keep up with my tempo I'm too fast but you know though
Queen of all the elements
I'll make your moves irrelevant
I'm loving every bit of it
You thought I was so delicate
I'm savage but so elegant
You're scared of me it's evident
I know why you're so hesitant
I'll leave you feeling desolate
Take my word, I am not just a flower
I'll learn to take you and then beat you by the hour
I'll burn you down and watch you fall like the Brass Tower
It's so fun to watch you whimper and then cower
My dance doesn't sound that bad right?
I mean you'll probably feel some pain from the last fight
Please amuse me, entertain me
Just remember that I'm not just an Eevee

[Interlude: RogersBase]
Back like we never left like Brago D. Ace, you already know who it is
Roger D Luigi, the anime king, let's go

[Verse 8: RogersBase]
Name's RogersBase, got me the Will of D
Repping Sabo Charizard, Mera Mera no Mi
While I'm watching One Piece you're crying over Butterfree
Keep my bars PG, we Disney
Just kidding 'bout my linguistics
I'm like Machamp with No Guard, Punches that are Dynamic
Confusing little Poochyena who pretend they're slick
I'm in Unova banging Skyla, TM56
That's Fling son, but you don't know because you never even had one
This ain't a roast but if it was it'd be a Take Down
Double Teaming like Giancarlo Parimango made a tweet that exploded that was followed by a countdown
Bitch!
I'ma Volt Switch
Brick Break all your dreams and your hopes with
Cross Chop 'til you're nothing but an old glitch
Earthquake 'til you're Trubbish in a trash ditch
Cold as ice, my flow is nice
I ain't a Delibird, my presents are far more precise
Call me Mr. Game and Watch, Punk-ass Sheik
Just like Regi I pull 9's on fleek
Now here's a simple rhyme that'll help you sleep
About a girl who was cute looking like a Mareep
Attitude was static, hit me with Confuse Ray
Couldn't stand her anymore, finally used Run Away
Kept my phone in her Electric Terrain
Thought that maybe if she'd Dance I'd start making it Rain
But she evolved into a Flaaffy now she's past her prime
Now would you kindly please excuse me, I'm about to do Japan Time

[Verse 9: G. Yee]
Back on the beat like a Terracott
Blaring Altaria, gave adversaries the Perish Song
Everyone waiting for Garrett now
I gotta carry the weight of the world like Torterra shells
She knew that the snake is long
That's why she gave it up twice for the Gyarados
Your boy got Outrageous flow
Say you don't feel it, you must be a Fairy, hoe
It had to be said
Claiming you hard, you Diancie at best
Super effective, I'll blast you with lead
Oh here he goes with the Magnums again, so exaggerated
Take you back to the Gen when choosing a lead was a tactic you set before the battle commenced
That's the Platinum meta and Dactyl's a threat
So I'm saying I'm spraying with actual lead

[Verse 10: G. Yee]
From Mt. Coronet downpourin' on Houndour
With the spouts, Origin Pulses your health's lowerin' (Let's go)
Your spouse opening mouth orifice
And when I'm done she all sore I guess that's what they call Torchic (God damn)
These lames be Yanmega, I'm way beyond Mega
I hit my Prime all these earthlings feel my Precipice
When I'm entering the field all their flows turn useless
I'm saying my rhymes Desolate (Woo)
So eff a weak Drought
I V. Bell weed out all these B. Sprouts
When Yee's 'round, freaks loud, ladies scream out
Tonguing in between mounds like a Seel mouth, then I peace out
When I swing that Axew gon' get your whole branch Fraxured
In other words you're sappy son, Nosepass backwards
I last lap Donphan ball on the track man
G-Y-E-Evolving the rap game

[Verse 11: ShueTube & PK]
Hold up, who's the new dude?
It's ShueTube, came into the game like Mewtwo
Legendary flow when I step in the booth to
Kill another track, I attack like Gloom do
Acid spewed through rapid new tunes
Tryna make it happen only racking a few views
Guess I'm kinda Slaking on the rapping like "Who's Shue?"
Tryna make a path but I'm trapped on Route 2
Pumpkaboo-hoo, I'm done with YouTube
I'm just kidding, I'm never quitting, got my running shoes glued to my feet
So I keep on moving like Suicune moves
I'm not stopping, I'm chomping at the bit like a Bidoof tooth
I refuse to be stuck in this groove
Cause I got something to prove and nothing to lose
Must Jigglypuff too much of them doobs
It must be the fumes, I stay up like the Sun and the Moon
That funky Stunky skunk weed that'll leave you stunned and confused
I love the Budew, especially when it's covered and pruned
The other day ago I smoked some dro the color of Mew
It stunk up the room, was blowing out some Thundurus plumes
You need a Chesto cause my endo makes you slumber and snooze
A bummer it's true, but I'm finding ways to cope though
So enough about that dope dro, I'm supposed to boast 'bout my dope flow
Yo I stay flowing like Tohjo and I'm flamethrowing like Ho-Oh
Most these mofos I'm hearing they flow kinda Slowbro
I'm fed up with all the rappers thinking that they better
I said it, these Venonats really are pathetic
Insects who all lack the Antenna
Every time you rap you repel us
Need to zip your trap like Banette does
Every rhyme you craft isn't clever
You a copycat like a Cleffa
Need a Wake-Up Slap, Meloetta
Trubbish on the track, you are trash getting thrashed by a Mega

[Interlude: CTC]
Prepare for dankess, denounce the stankness
To protect the world from wack rappers
To unite all people within this motherfucker
Yung Basedlord!
Who's That Guy

[Verse 12: CTC]
Bitch I'm still in the cut, Sudowoodo
Still got my hat to the back and these rappers still wack, what you losers gon' do?
Hold up, b, you should be holding b
Go ahead accept defeat do like if you was a shoe
Me and my crew we come through
Snatch up yo' bitches and badges then toodle-doo
Haters be sleeping on me like Fruit of the Loom
But I got they girl sleeping on me like Fruit of the Loom
I make it cool to be rude, I don't just do it for views, I am that dude
Don't fuck around with them fuckarounds and get Noctowl like HOOT HOOT HOOT HOOT
Diggersby tho? Earthquake hit 'em below
I let my enemies know
Rolling up purp that's that Venipede dro
Catch me on Victory Road
Pinsir dismembering ten of your family members
That's quite an unpleasant memory bro
But I plead for insanity so as far as the anarchy goes I blame the Pidgeotto
Now I just gratata on sight like Pokémon Go
I'll just be taking your missus for hostage I'll let your Pokémon go
But I ain't cuffing no hoe I just poke 'em and go
Splash on your bitch like it's Popplio
Nobody lit as me cause I just hit more trees than a Rowlet that be toking on dope
Don't let me Polish the Rock or Lando will sweep you like I miss Dwight
You fucking with that Pinkman, I slang up them rocks like I'm Mr. White
Then I'ma ENDtei, SWEEPcune, ROCKkou
Then come for the rest of your dogs, like I'm Mr. White

[Interlude: CTC]
Gio-Gio-Giovanni
He be wishing for a body
Kill everybody walking
He's catching a homi tonight
[Verse 13: Matt Houston]
Bitch it's Matt Houston, I don't really care what you say
Kid been low key training with Blaine, everything I touch spit flames
Got that Arcanine and that Rapidash
Bars five out of five, Fire Blast your ass
Cut a hater in half with a Super Fang
Better watch out for that Rattata
And I'm back in that Cypher 2016 with a Perish Song, try to save 'em please
At their graves just leave some Floettes when I end 'em all from A to Z
Talked about girls and blazing weed in the last one so they hated me
Fuck that it don't phase me won't change a thing, okay proceed, dab
Win everywhere that I go, chilling on Victory Road
Gastrodon, Quagsire, Swampert shit give 'em a dose
Got your bitch digging the flow
My presence a present it Delibird Christmas the hoes
Still be Wally he so sick with it though
Girls all like Ralts where they getting too close
Cause they be feeling the kid on the low
Litten with the shits, the kid got a cinder quill and it char millions with every stroke
Please don't ever step I just be so fresh to death, got shit from Lilycove and Lumiose
Son, I could blast you away get you sent to the moon, you better watch your Lunatone
And if that ain't hell enough I'll make you Self Destruct
Blow the beat up like it's a Pineco, bomb
Want Static, Zap 'em with Dos
Hope you packing a potion
Tauros, back on my bull
Matt is the dopest, Will-o-Wisp a hater attacking with Vulpix
Back on my old shit
Snatching up yo' bitch, she Feebas splash on the whole clique
So quick swear that she know Swift
Drown you Kyogre flow it's vast as an ocean
Matt laid a trap and it's gon' hit
Haters Aipom climbing on my nuts but they don't really know shit, Psyduck
Arceus God Flow, Cypher apostle
Put a crack in your egg if you try my luck
It's Gengar the one that you hoe kids fear
Nickname Matt 'bout to own this year
Better know this clear, spit fire but it's been Team Mystic bitch, we the coldest here

[Verse 14: VI Seconds]
OH NO, who's back flyer than
HO-OH, fire, who's that about to
GOGOAT, I am firing something with a
PROBO-pass nose for a barrel
Suicine VI, the coldest nigga to speed past
Boy drop dead gorgeous, shit'll get ugly as a Feebas (Woo)
Yung Mudsdale, who tryna test my Stamina?
Kicks so hard it'll drain you like a catheter
Fucking great, you suckers hate the damage when the guns pop
Bucking 8, you'll up and faint and vanish, this a Nuzlocke
Your luck stops now, you don't understand who's nicer
When I pop up, anything can happen like a randomizer
Hitmonchan with this, every element I will pass a fist
Pacifist? Poisonous, anyone can get it like Salandit
Dazzling, savage flow you'll be lying from this Full Metal, bodied
Alphonse and Solgaleo
Go berserk and I'ma comatose a nigga
Get a battery the cops gotta stake out
Moving, their bodies I'm chalking, I ain't with the talking
I always hit first like a Fake Out
My suggestion is your team get to fleeing
I'm on some you wouldn't get from a TM
Holding a scope bitch, you still couldn't see him
So wavy I'm something you never could reel in
I got broads out in Johto (Skrt), the 'Rari same color Pangoro (Skrt)
Gimme tail 'til she Slowbro (Skrt), she feeling my abs solo (Yeah)
Flap your tongue? Seel 'em, a Pokémon Center can't heal 'em
Black x6 Kyurem, who's dying to VI? Oh, you're him
I'm on my six below Sheer Cold, frio
Now these birds give me three times the head, Dodrio
Every day is Pay Day, I'm back for cash
Boy I'm fire 'bout the horse play so I think you should Rapidash
I ain't a fan of your character fam
I stay keeping metal in hand, Alakazam
I'm giving out Rare Candies, boy you ain't half as nice
So cold they going to sleep, tell you Dragon night
I'm ill, the walking Pokérus and I let it show
Nasty with the steel, niggas all know my Meta gross
This a Clear Body, I'm doing my job
Wherever you are, see us and you just heard it from the God of Fire4
