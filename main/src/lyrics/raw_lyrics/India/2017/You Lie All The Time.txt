You lie all the time
Yeah, you do
But I can't complain
'Cause I'm just afraid of losing you
You don't understand
Yeah, you don't
'Cause if I explained
You'd just hate the way it goes

[Chorus]
So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do, we look the other way

[Verse 2]
You say it's alright
Yeah, you do
But it's fine
'Cause you hate to see me cry, cry, cry

[Chorus]
So tell me it's okay
That everything is great
'Cause I just hate the fact
That every time we do, we look the other way
You might also like[Outro]
And if you ask me
What I'd want to do
I'd look you in the eyes
And end up asking you, oh
You, oh
Oh, you
Oh, you6
