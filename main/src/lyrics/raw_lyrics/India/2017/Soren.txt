Miss your hair
I like the way you stare into my eyes
Most the time
The way you touch me is like a curse that can't be broken
But it hurts
Most of the time

[Chorus]
And if there was a place that I had to choose
Or a memory that fades that I cannot lose
If there was a place that I could call home
Before I die, you oughta know
Itâ€™d be in your arms tonight

[Verse 2]
The green in your eyes
Are like the leaves in the summer
And it changes with the weather
The pink in your cheeks
When you slightly lose your temper
Makes me love you even more

[Chorus]
And if there was a place that I had to choose
Or a memory that fades that I cannot lose
If there was a place that I could call home
Before I die, you oughta know
It'd be in your arms tonight
It'd be in your arms tonightYou might also like4
