If you wanna dance then
Dance with me
It's pretty fast but
This is what you do at parties, right?

[Chorus]
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like you

[Verse 2]
Just take it slow
And move your feet to the beat
'Cause if we dance then
You donâ€™t have to speak

[Chorus]
And I know it's hard to tell
But I think I really like youYou might also like11
