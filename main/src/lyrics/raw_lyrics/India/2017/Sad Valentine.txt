I'll write this song
'Cause I can't find the words to say
To your face, "I'm all alone"
And it's February 14th
And I'm sitting by the phone
Replaying the dial tone
Replaying the dial tone
And I'm alone
And I don't wanna feel so sad
Feel so sad

[Verse 2]
No roses at the door
Ain't got nobody to lie next to
In the February cold
Replaying the dial tone
Replaying the dial tone
And I'm alone
And I don't wanna feel so sad
Feel so sad

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna feel so sad
No I don't wanna feel so sad
Feel so sad
No I don't wanna feel so sadYou might also like1
