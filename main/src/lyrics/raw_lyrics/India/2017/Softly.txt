Is it alright
To feel this way so early?
But am I blind?
All the sweet nothings fallin' in love overnight

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me, girl, I gotta know

[Chorus]
Touch you softly, I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right, but you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood, know what I'm tryna do (Oh)
Do you think that we can move closer, baby?
I want you, yeah, yeah (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
And all my life
Been wanting this forever (Mm)
And in my mind
Think of ways to ask you "Why don't you come over sometime?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't mean to get so close
And I know that I should probably go
But I got this feeling
Tell me, girl, I gotta know

Touch you softly, I call you up late at night
Know that it isn't right, but you could be my one and only
You get me in the mood, know what I'm tryna do (Oh)
Do you think that we can move closer, baby?
I want you, yeah, yeah (Ooh)

[Outro]
And I don't care what they say
And I don't care what they say
Care what they say to me, I'm doing it differently
Baby, I'm doing it differently17
