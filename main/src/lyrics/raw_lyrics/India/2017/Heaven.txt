Alone, for the last time
You're just a loner
Give it a try
And you're hard on yourself
And your laugh, it just melts in my hands
Lonesome in the street
You say the mice all seem to laugh at me

[Chorus]
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side
I'll get by with you on my mind
I'll get by with you on my side

[Verse 2]
I'm not at home (At home)
And I'll just say that
Being with you makes me feel less old
A kid on the street playing basketball
Horses will run forever, can't be called

[Bridge]
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
Wish that I, wish that I
Wish that I could go back in time

I'll get by with you on my mind (On my mind)
I'll get by with you on my side (On my side)
I'll get by with you on my mind (On my mind)
I'll get by with you on my side18
