Don't look me in the eye
I get embarrassed when you see me cry
These thoughts I can't articulate
Got me feelin' some type of way

[Chorus]
Guess I was a fool for believing you
Yeah, the truth hurts more than a lie or two
More than a lie or two

[Verse 2]
Door closes and you're gone
You left me hangin' on this love for far too long
Nostalgia has me feeling bittersweet
Reminiscing on the days things were easy

[Chorus]
Guess I was a fool for believing you
Yeah, the truth hurts more than a lie or two
More than a lie or twoYou might also like3
