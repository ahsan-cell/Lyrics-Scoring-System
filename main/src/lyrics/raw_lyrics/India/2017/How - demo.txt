How did I try to get you off my mind?
How did I try to get you off my mind?
Could this be the end
Of you and I for now?
Hope that I see you soon
Don't know what I would do
My heart is under the weather
I know that Iâ€™m the only one who can heal it
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I try to be the strong one for you
But that's just too hard for anyone to do
