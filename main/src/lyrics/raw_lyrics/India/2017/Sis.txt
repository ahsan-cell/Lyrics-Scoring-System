Feelings are so fragile
Egos are always blown
A ship in a bottle
Collapses under my cell phone
Your soft skin, unbroken sin
Next to my rough callouses
A mild kiss, sleep paralysis
Tell me more about your sister

[Verse 2]
Brittle bones
Hold my body together
Tender touches
Mend me with feathersSee Clairo LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like2
