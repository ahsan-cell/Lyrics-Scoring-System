The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free
Oh, the devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free

[Verse 1]
I went down, deep Texas, Mississippi state
Hoping things might go my way
For every hard-earned dollar I make
There stands a white man just to take it away
Some might say I talk loud, see if I care
Unlike them, don't walk away from my fear
I've busted bones, broken stones, looked the devil in the eye
I hope he's going to break these chains, oh yeah

[Chorus]
The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free
The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free

(Yeah, set me free)

[Verse 2]
Another hard day, no water, no rest
I saw my chance, so I got him at last
I took his six-shooter, put two in his chest
He'll never say a word no more
Oh, he'll never say a word no more
The devil got him good for sure

Ain't got no place to call a home
Only chains and broken bones
Ain't got no place to call a home
So come on Lord, won't you take me now?
Ain't got no place to call a home
Only chains and broken bones
Ain't got no place to call a home
So come on Lord, what you waiting for?

[Chorus]
Oh, the devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free
The devil's going to make me a free man
The devil's going to set me free

(The devil's going to make me a free man)
Only chains and broken bones
(The devil's going to set me free)
Ain't got no place to call a home
(The devil's going to make me a free man)
So come on Lord, won't you take me now?
(The devil's going to set me free)
Ain't got no place to call a home
