Hello, hello
Who put love in my head?
I know, I know it's made of lead
Hello, hello
Science came, my kingdom reigned
Below, below, my Charlemagne

[Chorus]
And the river always flows, so if you go, I will know
By the rain, my Charlemagne

[Verse 2]
Hello, hello
My eyes, tried, hide, cried, died
Inside the snow in the winter
Hello, hello
The doctors knew, prescribe me you
Below, below the amber sky

[Chorus]
And the river always flows, so if you go, I will know
By the rain, my Charlemagne
And the river always flows tears of gold
Left me cold, do you feel the same, my Charlemagne?

My Charlemagne, my Charlemagne
My Charlemagne, my Charlemagne
Don't go
If only I could show you
Don't go
If only I could show you
Don't go
If only I could show you
Don't go
If only I could show you

[Outro]
And the river always flows, so if you go, I will know
By the rain, my Charlemagne
And the river always flows tears of gold
Left me cold, do you feel the same, my Charlemagne?
