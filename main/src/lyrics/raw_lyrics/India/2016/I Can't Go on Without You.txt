Well they thought they were made for each other
One thinking of one another
Never thinking just for one second
She would take a different attraction

[Pre-Chorus]
We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no
We don't want that
We don't want that
We don't want that
Oh no

[Chorus]
I can't go on without you
I can't go on without you
Can't go on without you, yeah
I can't go on without you

[Verse 2]
Oh so, what's the point in breaking my sweetheart?
She wanted me to let down my guard
Well, you know what they say, it's better that way
So, so you better hush and walk away
