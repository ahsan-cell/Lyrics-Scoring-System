Daddy was dumb, said that I'd be something special
Brought me up tough but I was a gentle human
Said that he loved each of my two million freckles
When I grew up, was gonna be a superstar

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can't get a job, so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I sit in the car and I listen to static
She said I look fat, but I look fantastic

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe

[Verse 2]
I'm wakin' up lost in boxes outside Tesco
Look like a bum sippin' codeine Coca-Cola
Thought that I was northern Camden's own Flash Gordon
Sonic ray gun, gonna be a superstar

I can't get a job, so I live with my mom
I take her money but not quite enough
I make my own fun in Grandmama's basement
Said I look mad, she said I look wasted

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe
Cut back down to my knees
Gotta get back, gotta get free
Cut back down to my knees
Lean back now, lean back and breathe30
