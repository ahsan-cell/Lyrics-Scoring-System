Can you walk on the water if I, you and I?
Because your blood's running cold outside the familiar true to life
Can you walk on the water if I, you and I?
Or keep your eyes on the road and live in the familiar, without you and I
It glows with gates of gold, true to life

[Chorus]
For our love is a ghost that the others can't see
It's a danger
Every shade of us you fade down to keep
Them in the dark on who we are
(Oh, what you do to me)
Gonna be the death of me
It's a danger
'Cause our love is a ghost that the others can't see

[Verse 2]
We took a walk to the summit at night, you and I
To burn a hole in the old grip of the familiar, you and I
And the dark was opening wide, do or die
Under a mask of vermillion ruling eyes

[Chorus]
And our love is a ghost that the others can't see
It's a danger
Every shade of us you fade down to keep
Them in the dark on who we are
(Oh, what you do to me)
Gonna be the death of me
It's a danger
'Cause our love is a ghost that the others can't seeYou might also like20
