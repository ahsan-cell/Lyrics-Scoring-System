I don't wanna wake up today
Mama said I gotta put a straight face on
Another day, another friend dead
Fuck life, think I need a rain check
Yeah, I don’t want to maintain
I just wanna lane change
I don't want to feel pain
Give me pills, I don't want to feel a thing
Probably got a couple bounties on my head now
Paranoid, hearin’ noise in my head
I'm a dead man, yeah
I see the motives in people, the evil, the clout demons
Scheming for reason
Play me like a bitch, yeah
Sweet nothing in my ear drums, yeah
Baby want to take my soul
Take me high, take me low
Take me out of control

[Chorus]
I thought you would be mine but now you're leavin'
I thought I was Superman but now I'm bleedin'
Lately, I've been up late and I'm not sleepin’
When I think about you, I stop breathin’
I thought you would be mine but now you're leavin’
I thought I was Superman but now I'm bleedin'
Lately, I've been up late and I’m not sleepin'
When I think about you, I stop breathin'
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'm not good enough for you
And I know what I got to do for you
To fall in love with me again
But I know myself and I can't pretend like
I'm changing my ways
I'm not faded, I'm famous, but what's the difference?
I get high as the likes on my Instagram pictures
Bitches only fuck with me for my stats
I'm not blind to fake smiles, I see right through you
I'm like Ray Charles to the fuck shit
Phone calls on my phone got me upset
Baby tellin' me she wish she never met me
But she wasn't complaining when I got her the Bentley
Pick me up then break me down
Rip me apart, leave me empty

[Chorus]
I thought you would be mine but now you're leavin'
I thought I was Superman but now I'm bleedin'
Lately, I've been up late and I'm not sleepin'
When I think about you, I stop breathin'
I thought you would be mine but now you're leavin'
I thought I was Superman but now I'm bleedin'
Lately, I've been up late and I'm not sleepin'
When I think about you, I stop breathin'
[Outro]
I stop breathing
Now you're leaving
I stop breathing
Now you're leaving
(I stop breathing
Now you're leaving
I stop breathing)11
