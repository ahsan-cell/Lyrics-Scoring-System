My heart is beating so fast
Anytime I see those eyes as bright as a glass
I hope love & pleasure
Is all we can feel when we’re around each other

Pre-chorus:
All I do is keep coming your way (your way), your way (your way), your way
Hopefully we’ll get in touch someday (someday), someday (someday), someday

I don’t wanna front anytime you are around me
But deep inside I got a feeling
So lemme be the one that caters to your needs yeah

Chorus:
All night long
Imma be the moonlight of your world
I wish you were around mе all day long
To give you the company you desеrve
Whenever you come near me, I feel dizzy
What can I do if I want you to come with me babe?
Nevermind, ‘til the end of the night
I think I got a crush on you
I Think I got a crush on you
Ouh yeaah
