Pro league ballers got em balling on digits
Ringz, Jhayris ain't no way you wouldn't feel this
Working hard enough to keep my shit out of the critics
Marinated Urbans top ballers no limits
It’s a cold world but my team will never freeze
Only time dey bless a nigga only when a nigga sneeze
I heard you got big balls lets play em n a field (nfl).  Before i go pro in the league no NFL
Croc town who gon hold us down
Diamond in the dirth clearly you should know us now
Barely heard a sound, never knew we underground
Nearly made a 100 grand, how you like me now
1 time we got a hot track
Gat the love for the city gave it all back
Real recognise real nigga all facts
Came from the mud now we shinning gloss backs
Get off the horse back and see who really runs the track
You said im wack but you really couldn't handle dat
It’s fire in the booth, Cinch please tell em that
At least Ris tell em that, please get your paper

Welcome to the dream league these rappers wanna be in, but their rap standard not cool so they going relegation
My career warming up, am going in to be the best, these rappers exhausted, their time is up, Substitution
You ain’t enlightened cause you live on cream or lotion
My rap flow hard and it causing erosion
Not a real person, imma ghost trapped in this rap beat
Sticking to me, she calls him baby maybe i can baby sit
Like Coby Ringz y’all know i gat more Ringz to go places very fast in my career forget sonic the hedgehog
Few jobs in the state, but am getting blow jobs this ladies are my clients buh they ain’t nothing like a backlog
Architect and rapper, watch how i draw this punchlines
First class flight with my Audemars, this a topped up airtime
Am an offside they never caught! Cox I’m ahead of my of my time
We ain’t prime mates(primates) I’m ahead, checkout my prime time
Am blazing em tracks
Honestly I’m raising alarms
They say I’m hot but am cooler than ice
If time is money and money talks ama keep talking to my Audemars
They ain’t got innovations to be in the league so I’m creating em Seminars
If it's not about the pepper tell me what's the point of grinding
Never trying is the only thing I’m never trying
When they talking realness well I’m the emphasis
Little Revelation, I’m Tryna make this numbers, this is my genesis. For real
