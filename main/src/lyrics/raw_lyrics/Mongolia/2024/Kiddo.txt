Aye first song welp here goes
I'm Lil kiddo playing in the sandbox
Thinking of ways to take your girl

[Verse 1]
I'm Lil kiddo playing in the sandbox
Thinking of ways to take your girl, oh
I came from the planet Pluto
But my friend you can suck your toes, yeah
You can't even count to four
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Imma Lil kiddo sitting in a speedo, wait what
Imma Lil kiddo try to keep up, oh
I love me some Cheetos, only spicy

[Verse 2]
In the morning I be eating Cheerios
I'll blast this song on the stereo
Your girl be in the back of Subaru, yeah
I see you I go into turbo, okay okay
That and she's mine now
Tats say never talk to thots
Harlee and Kylie they're good examples
Donâ€™t ask who I am I'm Lil Kiddo
Never talk to thots, yeah, never talk to thots, yeah
Get out of the way if you're a thot (you're a thot)
I just want some Cheetos
Yeah, I just want some Cheetos
I just want some Cheetos and some Cheerios

Imma Lil Kiddo sitting in a speedo, wait what
Imma Lil Kiddo try to keep up, oh
I love me some Cheetos, only spicy
Imma Lil Kiddo sitting in a speedo, wait what
Imma Lil Kiddo try to keep up, oh
I love me some Cheetos, only spicy
Imma Lil Kiddo sitting in a speedo, wait what
Imma Lil Kiddo try to keep up, oh
I love me some Cheetos, only spicy
Imma Lil Kiddo sitting in a speedo, wait what
Imma Lil Kiddo try to keep up, oh

Imma Lil kiddo sitting in a speedo, wait what
