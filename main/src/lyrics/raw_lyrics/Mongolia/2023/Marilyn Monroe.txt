Bro don't ever pass me a ball hog
And bro play with Barack like Obama (Obama)
And they gon' always wanna triple cross ya
And she got pretty legs, she from Sauga
Marilyn Monroe's I'm on my Wassas (Wassa)
Marilyn Monroe's I'm on my Wassas (Wassa)
Watch how I rock you, but I don't need a roster
He can't do that all alone, that nigga need a partner

[Verse 1: SYPH]
Patek Philippe on me
It cost me a hunnid
Dawg let's keep it a hunnid
Know that we up to something
My youngins will pull up and dump him
I gotta go pick up his onion
I'm on the fire with the junkies
A hundred racks in luggage
I got hunnids too, I got hunnids too
Watching all my moves, they want me to lose
And I be sending shots, 1942
Fell it love with number one, left with number two
Yeah, these niggas ?
VVS's in my chain, yeah they're water baby
Solid city in them G, man, they gotta hate me
And it's still fuck the other side, cause they violated
Yah, yah

[Verse 2: Pressa]
I'm so sick, I need a doctor
Each and all day i need an oppa (ration)
Say we balling like we ought to
Pressa in the club with his stalker
Who doing this round, shot been getting called
Ain't going to help you get on
How much niggas i fit on the lawn
My seagull got, keep a Glock like friends or not
Barretta holds sixty shots
Come from missing noodles brah
I'm getting paid, I'm doing the carter eh?
Run the street like 108
How much money we done made?
I gotta get rich, different hustles, different whips
Life was hard, came from traphouse with a whip
