I got ice so cold you could feel it
Double tone, double tone
Thotties hit the line
Switch the phone, switch the phone
Last time
Lurking with a chrome, with a chrome
Cause ain't nobody coming for the throne, for the throne
That's mine
Nigga that's life, goddamn
I got 2 damn phones in the same damn hand
I got switched on fast by same damn friends
But they calling back fast
When a nigga got bands on me

[Verse]
Rest in peace the ones, deserved the world but never got to have it
It's like fakest getting papers only realest catching static
Thought you wasn't down to ride before the "TCM" what happened
That's the dream to sign my life away and give up all my masters
They tell me I could feel they spirits when the sun begins to set
I really hope that that's the truth but I just can't believe it yet
I'd trade a hundred million bands for all the ones I can't forget
Id give it all for those who didn't get they chance to make amends
It seems like lately people only rock with me for dividends
And ain't nobody really messing with me once the party ends
And I apologize to those who really rocked with me instead
But I was steady by myself at night when I ain't made it yet
Like you could save the world again and they still act like you a nothing
Go get yourself a band, a couple checks and all a sudden
Its a lot of rats around you, come and take the cheddar from you
Winter's coming finna leave me with a heart so cold you could feel it

[Verse 2]
I got the bands for now
Don't want that to be a thing of yesterday
I got the Stans for now
Don't want that to be a thing that fades away
Imma stay grinding from day to day
I stay on my premises, bay to bay
If you finna peep, got shit to say
You better stay out of my lane today
I'm upping the pad with a big lock
And you could be clubbing with big thots
But we in a birdie, a big chop
We roll with a army, that's big shots
We call up 130 you get dropped
I'm turning your diamonds to rubies
They tell me I'm "Ballin'"
Run up some digits
I'm striking it Ricch with 2 C's
Gooling, I'm with the G's on my glatt
If you is a groupie, you not with the pack
Cause most of these niggas be faking, they acting
We pulling up, make a movie, a classic
It's fuck all the Mambas, I'm not finna pass
Your curtains be closing so we get to clapping
New Model X, I ain't gotta do traffic
If these niggas not finna walk we going bat shit
