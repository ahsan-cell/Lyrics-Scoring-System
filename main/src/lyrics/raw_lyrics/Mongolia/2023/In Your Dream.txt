And I'm seeing through the shadows
Private Captain Sparrow, never hit a rago, yeah (Umars Soundz)
If I do then I'm a vando, yeah, yeah
And I'm seeing through the shadows
Pirate Captain Sparrow, never hit a rago, yeah
If I do then I'm a vando, yeah

[Verse 1]
All the money in the world, you still end up all alone
All the pussy in the world, I might jack off all alone
Got a call we took the packet straight to the end zone
Fly vacuums, yeah, yeah, Julio Jones, yeah
Fly alone, fly straight on my Jack Jones
Leaning tower, money, eating pizza, see me up in Rome

[Chorus]
This that light brown with bits, yeah, Toblerone
Say it loud, you know Huncho don't do monotones
I'm preaching, told my brothers, "Hear my monologue"
Yeah, I used to be in broke jeans, Jack and Jones
Hella weed up on my dresser, dresser
Now we grown, yeah, bitches they don't wanna fuck, yeah
Now we bone, yeah
Better days never used to fornicate, yeah
Better days, I didn't get hurt by the hate, yeah
Real trays, loud hays
Always hit him in a alley by the gate
Enemy of the state, frenemies they turn snake
Need gelato in a crate, yeah, in a crate
Spend some money for the sake of spending money
You can't relate no way
This a man sport, you ain't got your game, yeah
You can not partake
So superior like the lake
I got water from the lake
I'm immune to all the hate
I'm immune 'til all the grave
I ain't immune to getting laid
And they sipping Haterade
Wishin' that the police catch me lurking when they do a raid
And I'm wishing for some less stress
Regardless still I'm self made, yeah
I only smoke Miami, bro, yeah
Yeah, I'm Dwayne Wade
And I'm hitting them, yeah, avoiding traffic I'm on ways, yeah
'Cause I'm just tryna find a way, yeah
'Cause I'm just tryna find a way, yeah
'Cause I'm just tryna find a way, yeah

Same place I'm tryna level up, yeah
Small waist and her belly tucked
Out here keep your pessy tucked
God ain't on your side, so you're out of luck
Out of luck, I keep my money crisp
This that Monster Munch
This that stu' at twelve A.M. so we can power up
And now our biz phoned through, we got the power buds, yeah
Man, I come with the pace, Speedy Gonzales
I'm scoring the goals with sauce in the back, long range like Alvez
I'm coming for top spot
Smoking now more I'm up top
Lil' kids up in cunch spots
Making money on stove pots, yeah
Lemme just make it another hit
The nitty's in love with the ting, so they phone up again they just wanted another hit
John Wick, making these mad blocks, yeah
Yeah, yeah, I got this
Chill with like seven, a few up in heaven
Nobody can across it, nobody can across it
You don't understand it
I didn't think I'd get this far, yeah, Huncho didn't plan it
People really threw me pennies, yeah
When this shit couldn't manage, yeah
When they really couldn't manage, yeah, yeah
Sitting in the barbers watching brothers criticise me
I'm the Harvard leaguers Ivey
Tell a young bull come and try me
Father them like I am Jay Z and they Ivy
Had a couple plugs moving pricey
Had a cutter on my waist if it gets slicey
Money don't sleep, so why sleep, jigga?
Used to shop PH, Jigga
You can't relate, Jigga
Them days we couldn't relocate, Jigga
Million pound dream still six figures
Leave out my yard looking six figures
Six figures, get rich or flow sicker
Blue rizla, they got small dreams, I see bigger pictures
It ain't what it seems I'm still the same Jigga1
