MATTE BLACK NAILS
A tirade of people walks in the green room. Setting up the room for glam to get ready for red carpet and screening LALA walks into the green room along with MEGAN and her glam squad “Think like a Man Too” She sits at her mirror and grabs the schedule to get a read through of the press run that will occur in moments. Her glam squad sets up behind her.
production managers are entering and exiting the room things are being carried out of the room.

INT.
Living Room- New York City
CARMELO just opened Rihanna’s Instagram and is looking at her most recent topless pictures and watching the NBA Finals in his living room. He’s lying on the couch with his thumb on his iPhone.

INT. Green Room
A production manager comes to Lala makes an in audible request. Her makeup artist is applying makeup on her face. She remains graceful but obviously overwhelmed by the lack of tranquility in her green room.

She grabs her phone out her assistant's hand and calls her husband, CARMELO

LALA
Hey baby!

CARMELO

LALA
(Waits for the rest)

LALA

CARMELO

(Carmelo presses speakerphone)

LALA
(Imitating reporter)

How is to work with Kevin Hart?

MAKEUP ARTIST makes a face

(Continues)
You can’t tell the truth. So, I’m like a pleasure.  He’s great so humble and kind…I feeling bad for lying.

CARMELO
(takes ear off phone goes to menu)

LALA:
Like now I’m the dressing room with Megan so Kevin can have a greenroom before his goes to his greenroom. That’s so crazy?

CARMELO:

LALA:
Then he wants a picture every 5 minutes which would be cool. But, I feel like I’m still on a movie set with all the directions.
LALA
Stand over here. Squat like this. Put your arms around my neck. Then he’s like Matter of fact stand behind me. Or it’s don’t sit to close put a lady in-between me and the boy for the height differential…Ugh.

LALA:

CARMELO:

LALA:

LALA’S MAKEUP ARTIST motions with one hand as if he has a tea cup and the other a saucer.…LALA mouths later and the makeup artist continues to apply makeup.
MEGAN grins over at LALA

LALA:
