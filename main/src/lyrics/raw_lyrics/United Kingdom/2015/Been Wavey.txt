Tryna catch a wave, man I've been wavey
She make it pop while I sip JD
Fine wine but her skin Baileys
I tell her, "rub up on the ting baby"
Woi-yo-yo-yo-yoi, rub up on the ting baby
Oi-yo-yo-yo-yoi

[Post Chorus]
Man I been wavey, wavey
I swear, all we do is win lately
Yeah we pull up in the Mercedes
All white like I'm Slim Shady, oh yoi yoi
Gyal you know it's all your choice
You can go off with that wasteman deya, deya
Or cuff up with your boy

[Verse 1]
Gyal I know it sounds crazy
But tonight you my lady, yeah
These other gyal don't phase me
Come like Beyonc√© Jay-Z, you know (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Girl, don't you know you that I live for this?
The way you sing, sing along to my symphonies
I can tell that you're into me
Pour the ting cah you know we gotta drink to this
You might also like[Chorus]
Tryna catch a wave, man I've been wavey
She make it pop while I sip JD
Fine wine but her skin Baileys
I tell her, "rub up on the ting baby"
Woi-yo-yo-yo-yoi, rub up on the ting baby
Oi-yo-yo-yo-yoi

[Post Chorus]
Man I been wavey, wavey
I swear, all we do is win lately
And we grind till this ting pays me
If your gyal want me fam then don't blame me, man don't blame me
Ha, oh yoi yoi, gyal you know it's all your choice
You can go off with that wasteman deya, that wasteman deya

[Verse 2]
But think wisely nuh
You wanna do this ting right you know
Might have bitches on the side for now girl
But I swear you just my type you know, woah
Cah dem gyal there try impress me
But you the one, you the one that I find sexy
Got me grippin' on your waist while you press me
You know behind closed doors this will really get messy
[Chorus]
Tryna catch a wave, man I've been wavey
She make it pop while I sip JD
Fine wine but her skin Baileys
I tell her, "rub up on the ting baby"
Woi-yo-yo-yo-yoi, rub up on the ting baby
Oi-yo-yo-yo-yoi, man I been wavey

Tryna catch a wave, man I've been wavey
She make it pop while I sip JD
Fine wine but her skin Baileys
