It's Unknown T, Homerton B
I've got gyallie on me
Opp block, bally on me
Panic and dash
Dem boy run and retreat
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
Gyallie on me
Bally on me
Panic and dash

[Verse 1]
Samurais in batches
Whack, whack, pull up, skrrt, reverse
Bang, the ting goes back in the jacket
Hope the clip or the spin' make him backflip
When it comes to the trap
All my niggas work off the magic
Got that 10 out of 10 and it's banging
Apart from the tragics, listen
I was on the backroad picking my cats
Nike tracksuit, and a 'fuck off' hat
Girls-girls move then come back
Her tits went out when she saw my stack
Pull up, pull up where it is or jaft
Wanna go home?
Tell that bitch call cab
How could you make that your darling one?
When that Barbie's lookin' like Bratz, and
How could you make that your hubby?
Empty tummy, that nigga eat brass (Hmm)
Went on a meal den dashed
Listen, look
Baby, bend ya' back and then dig it
Dig it, bend ya' back and then dig it
Back and then dig it, gyal want more dickin'
Back in one minute, bag up that spinach

It's Unknown T, Homerton B
I've got gyallie on me
Opp block, bally on me
Panic and dash
Dem boy run and retreat
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
I've got gyallie on me
Opp block, bally on me
Panic and dash
Dem boy run and retreat ('Treat)

[Verse 2]
Unknown T, let me come and spin it (Bow)
Me, YB had a big bruck-back '015 days
Think I'm kidding?
T jumped out, tryna catch some drillings
Man get fried, finna duck them chickens
Outside of mans college, in front of the innocent
Slide tru' back to back, and I'm filling 'em
Round movin' horrid in front of civilians
Look, it's mental up in my ends
Got packs on crack, nutshells and skengs
Jakes got helicopters with lights
And they all beaming down on my friends (Fuck)
The shits too obb' in the ends
Let me tell you 'bout déjà vu
Old school days, I held my first skeng
Bro you're an actor, please don't pretend
YB and Ram, that's active gang
Word to KO:
Seen men with the biggest of shanks have no heart
Cause they ran, and they ran
Cut tru' main road, get robbed, man, damn
Cut tru' main road, get robbed, man, damn
Back my J-Lo and back shot man
They're Madeleine gang, cos they vanished and ran
Buck my main hoe, that's backshot gang
Baby bend ya' back and then dig it
Dig it, bend ya' back and then dig it
Back and then dig it, gyal want more dickin'
Back in one minute, bag up that spinach
Bandits and figures, rappers and drillers
Grab a few nanks, or grab a spare spinner
Back in the lab, the feds wanna trap
"They're trafficking grams", it's back it or dash
[Chorus]
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
I've got gyallie on me
Opp block, bally on me
Panic and dash
Dem boy run and retreat
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
I've got gyallie on me
Opp block, bally on me
Panic and dash
Dem boy run and retreat (-treat)

[Outro]
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
Gyallie on me
Bally' on me
Panic and dash
Run and retreat
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
Gyallie on me
Bally' on me
Panic and dash
Run and retreat-treat
R-run and retreat ('Treat), r-r-r-run and retreat-treat
It's Unknown T, Homerton B
Hom-, Hom-Hom
Homerton B
Panic and dash
