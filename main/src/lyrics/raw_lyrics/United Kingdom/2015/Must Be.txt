Man, you're guilty, say you’re guilty by association
Man, you're guilty, say you're guilty by association
Now you’re guilty, yeah, you're guilty by association
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

[Chorus]
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a—
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a opp
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be

[Verse 1]
I've seen a man fucked up, seen a man locked up
Blammed up, chopped up, downtown up top
Man get the guap up, then man get the drop top
Gyal in the crop top, man get the thumbs up
Cah he got his funds up, outside non-stop
Five man, one block, eating out of one pot
We coming like Rambo, who's really on stuff
Homeless Columbo, sitting by the bus stop
Let a couple man go, show man tough love
Outside a bando, man had a stand off
The ting had extendo, show him how it bangs off
Gyal in commando, she take the pant off
Wish man bare love, show man nuff love
Cool with some, got beef with the rest of
If man slip, get up, dust yourself off
Everyone F off, yo

If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a opp
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp

[Verse 2]
You laugh with the opps, you smile with the opps
You gon' cry with the opps, make him fly with the opps
You filthy, guilty by association
Put the location in my navigation
It was an invasion
I didn't wanna, ride but I had a temptation
Every time I ride there I feel a sensation
Every time I speak, it's a money conversation
I try bring you part of the money operation
But it didn't work ’cause of miscommunication
Black boys never have no organisation
You don’t know yourself so you look for validation
You a FBI, where you get your information?
I think he's an opp, but I need a confirmation
I see you with a opp, now you need a explanation
But every time I see them it’s acceleration
[Chorus]
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a—
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a opp
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be

[Refrain]
Man, you're guilty, say you're guilty by association
Man, you're guilty, say you’re guilty by association
Now you're guilty, yeah, you're guilty by association
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, yeah

[Chorus]
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a—
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be
If it walk like a opp, talk like a opp
Smell like a opp then it must be a opp
If it look like a opp, chill with a opp
Hang with a opp then it must be7
