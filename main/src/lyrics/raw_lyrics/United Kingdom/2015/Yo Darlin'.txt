Destination is the closest place
We can buy that drink, J.Dizzle or share
Now I'm about to sing two sips
Now I'm picturing the craziest things
I'm conversating, you say nuttin'
My shit rises if I face my belly button
And one sip bravery, hand rub her thigh
Had a rich girl looking till I bankrupt her eyes
Lord save me, I push back your eyes
That shit'll make me run back for time, for time
She 'bout to lick, made me look over there
By the time I look again, she was ready to declare
