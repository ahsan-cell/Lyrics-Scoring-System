I'm taking your Mrs, nah, brudda, I’m joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it’s getting all boring
I'm taking your Mrs, nah, brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring

[Verse 1]
Fuck sake, how many times did I make that exit?
The popo came quick so I legged it, stepped in the dance and the crowd went hectic
My bad B from Manny brought Beckeh
Spent one week in the 0161, now I call Cov' girls sexeh
Cheeky vodka with Coco
What's her name? I think Gogo
Fuck with her ’cause she loco
Mix the pondu na loso (Ha)
She post one pic on her Insta, hair on fleek and her skin like Kinder
And that boy there with the bootcut vexed ’cause his girl got swiped like Tinder
Back then girls tried air me, peak, but I switched cah I ball like Inter
Gang come through, you're a sprinter, winger, you’re a joke, man, best fix up
And I don't really wanna do problems
Private party in C-O-V, got bad B's coming from London
And I just backed five-six shots of the JD drink, now my head can't function
And my nigga Nav just sold white to the black guy, now the black guys all sunken
Baby girl, why you texting me, why you moving so desperately?
Shoot your shot like a penalty, let it sing like a melody
See JAY1 LiveGet tickets as low as $140You might also like[Chorus]
I’m taking your Mrs, nah, brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring
I'm taking your Mrs, nah, brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring

[Verse 2]
Ten pound for the taxi, that's guwop
Get brain in the backseat, no toss
Buss nut, then I skrrt out, no fuss
Gun lean with a bad B like Russ
Five girls in a three-door, that's nuts
Don't ask silly questions, man, touch
Make P but you're still taking bus
Talk shit but I couldn't give two fucks
Ayy, JAY1 too saucy, link up with a bad B from Allesley
Fuck up the beat like forty, JAY1 spit something, doing up talky
And half of them chicks all bore me, bop to the studio then I linked up Coolie
Stepped in the dance and my garms all sporty, peng girl with the big breast look naughty

[Chorus]
Nah, brudda, I'm joking
All these bad B's stay preeing cah I stepped in looking all frozen
My girl with the back looks lovely, like she ain't ever looking like your ting
Bro-bro stay busy in the bando and he told me it's getting all boring
[Outro]
I'm taking your Mrs4
