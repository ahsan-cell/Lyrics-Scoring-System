Keep you in check if you don't know
Take off your makeup and your contour
We do it sunrise 'til the sun go
When you're wearing that lingerie, oh no
Ya dun know, ya dun know
Take off your clothes and get close
Ya dun know, ya dun know
6:30 and get low

[Verse 1: OGD]
Me and my frienzie, smoking lemzie
You and your frienzie, come up in a Benzie
Gyal a Stacy, why you be envy?
Girl, I wanna have a conversation with you, girl na you
Gas up your long ting, come up in a coupe
See the way you talk back, gyal me know say you're rude
I need a bad gyal, can't live without you

[Verse 2: Kruddz]
Girl, bend over, says she loves it from the back
Likkle pini love to see that ass clap
The way you whine on a nigga, moving tapped
Had her pum leaking like a broken tap
That's why you're my baby, hmm
That's why you're my shawty
Say it's you, you, you, you, you
Know you want me, me, me, me, me
