Me and my guys come from a London
We reckless, we don't care 'bout where you come from
If you come from the East or the South or the West, we don't care, we got protection like a condom
Ain't no other cities that can challenge us
We in the cars, we ain't on the bus
I said, no other cities that can challenge us, yeah
I swear, my Brixton girl, I love the way she work it
But she bad as hell, but beautiful, she perfect
Just come over here, baby, don't be nervous, no
