This is the 9 Side
Black tints that's a drive by

[Pre-Chorus]
See I don't wanna talk 'bout beef right now
But they're stepping on my toes
(But they're stepping on my toes)
And I don't wanna jump in a hoop with the goons
I can do it on my own
(I can do it on my Jack Jones)
Baby see my phone yeah that's Lyca (Lyca)
Baby yeah that's Lyca to Lyca
If I really had time I'll wife ya
See I'm busy doing road with the white stuff
If I can't get caught in a ride no way
If I get caught, in a ride ohh leyy
If you talk to the feds that's a boom-bye-yay
You can't come round mine nigga what no way

[Chorus]
This is the 9 Side
We live the high life
Black tints that's a drive by
5 goons that's a drive by
Nigga no lie-ie-ie

Whine it up, whine it up
Every girl up inna place wanna wine with us
Whine it up, whine it up
Every girl up inna place wanna wine with us
See im still up in the ends doing up hoopty
And my nigga EB slanging Suzie
Nigga-nigga uzi, nigga-nigga uzi
That nigga watching face like I know him, that nigga booky
So I had to hop on my phone
Then I had to call my guy
They don't even come my way
They don't even come my side
See if I hop out the hoop and put my mask on
'Bout you're on to me
Then I roll up the zoot then call my young don
It's a robbery

[Pre-Chorus]
See I don't wanna talk 'bout beef right now
But they're stepping on my toes
(But they're stepping on my toes)
And I don't wanna jump in a hoop with the goons
I can do it on my own
(I can do it on my Jack Jones)
Baby see my phone yeah that's Lyca
Baby yeah that's Lyca to Lyca
If I really had time I'll wife ya
See I'm busy doing road with the white stuff

If I get caught, in a ride ohh leyy
If you talk to the feds that's a boom-bye-ay
You can't come round mine nigga what no way
