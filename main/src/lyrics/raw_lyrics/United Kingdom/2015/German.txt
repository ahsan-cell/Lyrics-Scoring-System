Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my gold chain swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car

[Chorus]
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my gold chain swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car

[Verse 1]
They think they making P's, we be making R's
They be taking bus, we in a foreign cars
Come and take some change, top up your oyster card
We'll be living large because the world is ours
Because the world is ours
Look at my wrist, that's the reward for all these battle scars
Look at my roof, I took that off, I wanna see the stars
V-12 engine in a BM, so I'm coming fast
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car

[Chorus]
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car

[Verse 2]
I wanna make a shoutout to the teachers that said I wouldn't make it far
Look at me, baby, I be pulling up in foreign cars
Je m'appelle the money, man, yeah, I got foreign bars
They said that my come up was a fluke, I know how to play my cards
I'm always in a German coupe, I don't need no body guard
A German BMW, be my wife, that's all I ask
I got the sauce, I got the juice, foreign cars, we're going fast
I got the black Mercedes too, there's no way I'm coming last
[Pre-Chorus]
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car

[Chorus]
Got my wrist blinging in a German
Got my Gold chain Swinging in a German
Real G's man bringing in a German
Got some bad B's singing in a German
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car
In a German, in a German
In a German, whip in a foreign car9
