AYD, are you dumb boy?

[Pre-Hook: Ash]
I, come from
These ends
Peng ting, out of town
She hurt my feelings
Might just go to Broad Street on the weekend
Ask me where I'm from and if you see them

[Hook: Ash]
Say
Bir, Birmingham, man are from Birmingham
Them gyal are from Birmingham
Gyal are from Birmingham
Don't lie, Birmingham
Man are from Birmingham
Them gyal are from Birmingham
Gyal are from Birmingham

[Verse 1: Ash]
KMT, don't play with me
Tell them I know gangsters outside KFC
Tell them that I am from the streets
So I love it when the peng ting wears a hat over her weave
Trip to the Bullring
Spending money where I wanna
Everytime I phone the plug, plug
You be calling me the charger
I say Re-E-wind
MafDot, pull up the tune
Scratch that, pull up and boom
It's the Lotto Boyz, you dun kno

[Verse 2: Lucas]
We're all rooting for the city of Brum
The city I love, just tryin' put my city on top
Just roll deep in these show p's
The shows good, still comes on the block
And I'll be on top
Pay no mind to the answers
Just came off tour with Hus
Money stack long so we Lean and Bop
Now I'm just killin', we're bringing my team up
Don't give me a reason, on the mic I'm squeezin'
Empty clips no reason
Just tryna bring my team in
Grind hard, we achievin'
We'll be like from mornin' to evenin'
Hustle and bringin' the p's in
Broke boys get out your feelings
Breathin'
Lotto Boyzz, it is our season

[Verse 3: Jaykae]
You don't know what I'll do for the cash
I'm rollin' with Lucas and Ash
I don't wanna tell bro come thru with the mash
Just chill and move to the gash
I got it on smash
Please don't speak don't ask
Touch Broad Street I splash
I pop bottles no need for a glass
Top models for me and the lads
Like brandy, Grey Goose, Aliz√©e, champs
Got her number on the Pallisades ramp
Took her out on a Friday night
I had to 'low that by the Saturday rags
Is she dumb cos mans mental
I'm big in Brum like Grand Central
Don't flex on me with your whip
When I know the owner of that rental cos
[Pre-Hook: Ash]
I, come from (Brum town)
These ends
Peng ting, out of town
She hurt my feelings
Might just go to Broad Street on the weekend
Ask me where I'm from and if you see them

[Hook: Ash]

Bir, Birmingham, man are from Birmingham
Them gyal are from Birmingham
Gyal are from Birmingham
Don't lie, Birmingham
Man are from Birmingham
Them gyal are from Birmingham
Gyal are from Birmingham
