Both are considered to be the among the best white emcees of all time and some of the biggest lyrical heavyweights in the rap game period. Both seem to have their softer and more heartfelt moments while they can also get wild and crazy. In order to properly compare the two lets compare songs of both emcees catalogs in the following categories

Technical Lyrical Abiltiy: Generally in music lyricism is the ability to write lyrics for a song and convey a message, story, and etc.. However, in the context of hip hop discussions we will limit technical lyrical ability to mean the way an emcee rhymes. Their utilization of multiple complex rhyming techniques such as intricate rhyme schemes, multisyallble rhymes, internal rhymes, and etc… Things such as storytelling, song writing, content and other things usually associated with the word lyricism or lyricist in music generally will be analyzed in other categories. This is strictly the technical side of rhymes

Storytelling: This category will strictly analyze the way the emcees convey a story, while keeping in mind the uniqness and intricacies of the story plot themselves along with the way the artist conveys the story by utilizing poetic devices such as vivid imagery, and etc…

Socially Conscious/Content: A lot of emcees could rap very technical, however technicality is not the only thing when it comes to rap. This category will focus on what the emcee is saying and comparing the emcees most substantive and socially conscious songs, which includes songs with a message along with commentary on social issues, history, politics, religion, and etc…

Quotables/Punchlines: This category will compare the best individual lines of the emcees. The lines will be a mixture of
1. Punchlines, which is typiucally a line that is humorous, clever, witty, and uses wordplay or something along these lines
2. Quotables, which is a line that is not necessarily witty but is.. quotable. For example nas saying “I never sleep, because sleep is the cousin of death” is an example of a hard hitting quotable. It could be some type of law of wisdom that is timeless and never get’s old. Jadakiss has SOO many of these with a broad example when he said: “And you know they say that you deserved it whenever you die with your eyes open”
A good mixture that oscillates between the two would be a test of their wittiness, wordplay, and even substance

Rap God vs Definition of a rap flow

Rap God: I will only post the longest and highlight verse of the song to save space but we are comparing all the verses in each of the songs
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbGs_qK2PQA
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1
When I tried to say
"I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop"
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?
Definition of a Rap Flow- RA the rugged man
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGiwITaso_g&nohtml5=False
Rugged Man's flow is uglier than blind dates
My mental is heavy like Heavy D & Chubb Rock combined weights
I love myself, I'm so vain
I'm not just the king of New York, I'm the king of the whole game
Putting rappers in hibernation, they're hiding away
For retirement they're racing, it's funny, like a pie in the face
And devastating, made a mistake
And you're waiting, debating, facing your fate
And creating, hating, raping, imitating, the great
And break in your place and taking your safe and taking your paper
Paying for faking, this is history in the making, but wait
Spit at the cops, I'm resisting arrest
They wanna see me fry like a chicken wing and a breast
The truth is, behind closed doors I’m a bit of a sissy
Singing love ballads to bitches like Lionel Richie
No joking, bragging and boasting hoping to get close and approach 'em
Poke 'em, perking, and posing, putting poison in the potion
Cooking the coke and cutting your throat, any opponent opposing
Leave you float in the ocean
You was Aaliyah rocking the boat and
Leaving ya broken, get Smokey to second that emotion
Explosion of flowing, overdosing, the chosen has spoken, sing!

Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll.. I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet, 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes

I used to sneak in windows and steal Nintendos
Pimp hoes, white mandingos, I wear black, I don't wear pink clothes
Suffolk county anything goes
Why you trying to copy my shit like Kinkos?
I drop brickloads, sick flows, I done did those
Hit hoes, ripped shows, quotables kicked those
All the criminal shit and the sinning
They wanna know do I have a religion
Is there a god, do I believe in him?
Oh yes, how the fuck else could I be so blessed?
God put me on this earth to be one of the best (of all time)
And don't question it, it's a definite
The all time best in it, kept in it, repping it
The last one left in it
I'm A plus, you get a F in it
Negative, pessimist, effortless
Caucasoid, leporacy, lepedist, method in repping this
Fresher, so fresh in this, catching the specialist
I'm ol' D, special K, treacherous, I'm supaaa

Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with em a minute
Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference: they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment, nah nah
That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who could've saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you could've rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we could've been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream
I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See, Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out?

True story
Call me Thorburn, John A., staff sergeant
Marksman, skilled in killing, illing, I'm able and willing
Kill a village elephant, raping and pillage a village
Illegitimate killers, U.S. Military guerrillas
This ain't no real war, Vietnam shit
World War II, that's a war, this is just a military conflict
Soothing drug abusing, Vietnamese women screwing
Sex, gambling and boozing, all this shit is amusing
Bitches and guns, this is every man's dream
I don't wanna go home where I'm just an ordinary human being
Special Op, Huey chopper gun ship run shit
Gook run when the minigun spit, won't miss
Kill shit, spit four-thousand bullets a minute
Victor Charlie, hair-trigger, hit it, I'm in it to win it
Get it, the lieutenant hinted, the villain, I been it
The killing, I did it, cripple, did it, pictures I painted is vivid, live it
A wizard with weapons, the secret mission, we bout to begin it
Government funded, behind enemy lines
Bullets is spraying, it's heating up a hundred degrees
The enemy's the North Vietnamese, bitch please
Ain't no sweat, I'm told be at ease
Until I see the pilot got hit, and we bout to hit some trees
Tail rotor broke, crash land
American man in Cambodia, right in the enemy hand
Take a swig of the Whiskey to calm us
Them yellow men wearing black pajamas, they wanna harm us
They all up on us, bang, bang, bullet hit my chest, feel no pain
To my left, the captain caught a bullet right in his brain
Body parts flying, loss of limbs, explosions
Bad intentions, I see my best friend's intestines
Pray to the one above, it's raining, I'm covered in mud
I think I'm dying, I feel dizzy, I'm losing blood
I see my childhood, I'm back in the arms of my mother
I see my whole life, I see Christ, I see bright lights
I see Israelites, Muslims and Christians at peace, no fights
Black, Whites, Asians, people of all types
I must've died then I woke up, surprised I'm alive
I'm in a hospital bed, they rescued me, I survived
I escaped the war came back
But ain't escape Agent Orange: Two of my kids born handicapped
Spastic, quadriplegia, micro cephalic
Cerebral palsy, cortical blindness - name it, they had it
My son died, he ain't live, but I still try to think positive
Cause in life, God take, God give

As the world turns- Eminem
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_-xTRrSan0
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suing the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailer park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up? It's nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid 'til the first of next month
But if you would care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothing funny
Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me
With an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank God I was smokin' crack all day and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room that's when I seen her bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now, she said "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come here big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, now bitch, let's see who gets the best
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
(Come here bitch, come here, take this mothafuckin' dick bitch, come here)
The Greatest- RA the rugged man
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWUeShCe9pI&nohtml5=False
[Verse 1: RA the rugged man]
Nefertiti queen in a dream
Exotic mix, African-Swedish-Philippine
Starlet from the silver screen
Perfect from her painted toes to every last eyelash
High class, she’s a taste of arsenic in your wine glass
Femme fatale, put the blame on Mame, Rita Hayworth
She was worshipped by men the moment that her mother gave birth
Vixen, dark shadow on the wall, Nosferatu
If she spots you and she wants you
She already probably got you
Cherry lipstick, reckless living, the best description
Her body got curves that deserve their own geometric system
Garter belt, deadly red, stiletto heels, don’t trust it
Long legs, Lana Turner style, film noir, seductress, the greatest

[Verse 2: RA the rugged man]
Yo, the dame got to me
She wanted diamonds but not monogamy
She’s rich from a past husband’s life insurance policy
This mystery chick is risky
She chewed me up and spit me and tossed me like a freesbee
The Goddess had her claws in me
I treated her great but then she told me
We needed a break
Shattered my heart of glass like a Blondie-Puppini remake
Now she's been punched, drunk, and loved
And hung up with bums at clubs
Cheap ass chump thugs and punk scrubs that run drugs
Those bastards are lying
They ain’t satisfying as I am
Now she’s knocking on my door, wiping her mascara, crying
Get lost, I’m usually down to earth and I usually never brag
But the truth is, girl, I’m the best thing you ever had

[Verse 1]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydrating
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waiting
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escaping
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened, brain contemplating
Clean out the register, dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in waving the Mac
Co-operate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escaping the jack, grabbed her by the throat
It's murder she wrote, you barely heard a word
As she choked, it wasn't nothing for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yelling: "Freeze!"
But I'm already wanted for selling ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spelling bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearing a vest

[Verse 2]
Left the house, pulling out the drive backing out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blacking out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face:
"Shut your yacking mouth
'Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp!"
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinking fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit, grabbed the tape from out the deck
And lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimming pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screaming, "Johnny go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Acting like they never seen nobody hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must'a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must'a dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollering "truce-truce"
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
Smithhaven Mall- RA the rugged man
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1Z3gsPd8sM
Now let's get back to business
Witness the finish, shit is menace
Being broke make motherfuckers turn to sinners
I go to Smithaven Mall to see if anybody wants some
Anybody want some? But this is gonna cost 'em
I walk in the sneaker store
My ass is about to get raw
Look at my watch it's a quarter past four
My mind's blank, flipping, shitting
This the dead zone
I see this Spanish kid listening to reggae on his headphones
I grabbed him, snatched him backwards
Smacked him, he tried to react, it's when I was tempted to put a cap in him
But I didn't, I figured it was best if he was living
Pulled the SIG out everyone inside the store started shitting
I made everybody in the spot get down on they fours
I made a 300 pound woman strip down to her drawers
It was sickening, I couldn't believe what I was doing
My life is ruined at the age of 22
And it's for real, trying to find the spot the safe is
Cannot escape this, I'm scared to be in jail with all the rapists
I tried to rule the world but I blew it
I gave the fat naked bitch the gun to kill me, she wouldn't do it
So I took the gun back and beat her down
I gotta find a place to creep now (I gotta be out)
Yo, yo
This where my shit stops
I turned around, surrounded by six cops
Put the clip in my SIG, got six shots
They made my skull almost cave in for misbehaving
It's cause I chickened out and threw the gun down and gave in
I had no respect on the outside
But now I got less respect on the inside (inside)
I tried to rule the world but I blew it
Wishing I was dead but I still don't got the guts to do it

Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence (But who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!
[Eminem]:That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
[Dr. Dre]:Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!
[Eminem]:Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
[Dr. Dre]:Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it (You're right!)
Not over this shit, drop the biscuit (I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you

[R.A. The Rugged Man]; Listen, you faggot, and you listen good
I wanna make sure that it's understood, we don't play this shit in the hood
I'mma let of lead in your head soon
Bloodshed soon, blood-red soon, you gon' be dead soon
[Mr. Eon]: Nah, I got this, nobody is coming back for free, yo
It's not gonna be down 12-hundred in C-notes
Don't got that, I'm praying Dodger blew
A bum out of luck, what's a man gonna do?
[R.A. The Rugged Man]: Two in the morning, time to handle my biz
It's 2:15, I got my boys and we up in ya crib
They put a slug in your wife, I put a slug in your kid
Was you really that stupid, thought I'd let you live?

Sing For the moment- Eminem
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4hAVemuQXY
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
Still get Through the day- RA the rugged man
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL90ZmdjZrU&nohtml5=False
Living ain’t a breeze, please, life’s full of tragedies
We see our friends die, some get murdered, some die by disease
Got your finger on the trigger, don't do it
Contemplating suicide, just put the gun down, we've all been through it
An infant in his crib sprayed by stray bullets and dies
He was a future genius, he would have won a Pulitzer prize
The racist cop shot an innocent black
An 8-year old prostitute hoing getting mommy money for crack
A little boy molested by his step-father, hopeless
The little boy grew up now, he's molesting his own kids
The government watching you from a satellite like you ain't had it right
Your best friend snitching on you; that's animal-like
It's horrible watching your loved ones die and having to bury 'em
To seeing my cousin found dead, she overdosed shooting heroin
My family dying from sickening disorders
We found my brother Maxx
He was blue and purple and he was stiff with rigor mortis
My father got spots on his lungs, they think it's cancer
I'm praying every night, even if God don't ever answer
We can do it together, women hold your mans
Men hold your women, everybody let's hold hands and sing

Mosh vs Learn Truth

Mosh- Eminem
Https://vimeo.com/27790825
Imagine it pouring, just raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office, someone's trying
To tell us something maybe this is God just
Saying we're responsible, for this monster
This coward that we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head nodding - how could, we allow
Something like this without, pumping our fist now
This is our, final hour
Let me, be the voice, and your strength, and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six-teen
Million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinking we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why - cause I told you to fight!
Learn Truth- RA the rugged man
Https://youtu.be/HWzYIpUZCk8?t=87
Death by suicide bomb, protestants, Bibles, a Qoran, or Islam
From Genghis Khan to Vietnam I can smell the napalm
Rape victims, ripped stockings
Redneck clan members doing church bombings
Innocent fetus' being aborted with no options
Human governments ruin 'em
Worrying what weapons could be used to be nukin' 'em
Jesus was crucified in Jerusalem
Slaves treated like property, to Pearl Harbor to Hiroshima to Nagasaki
Adolf Hitler, to every murderous Nazi
To the Gambinos, to the Gottis, to every mafia atrocity
Child pornography, babies starving and dying in poverty
Serbians fighting Croatians in Yugoslavia
Muslim women being raped, up to 40,000 in the war in Bosnia
The 50 million killed in the second World War
The government's poisoning the minds and the bodies
Of the babies that are born poor
Airplanes blown up by Islamic extremists
In religion there's always drama
Whether worshipping the Prophet Mohammed or Jesus
Small pox to Napoleon's troops dying from typhus
From the Spanish flu to the black plague, today it's AIDS virus
Bodies in coffins, political extortions
Racist mobs murdering, Willie Turks, Michael Griffith and Yusef Hawkins
Check the murder rate, is it human nature to murder and hate?
The Catholic church claimed women were witches and burned 'em at the stake
Pedophile predators attacking
.38 Beretta used by Ghandi's assassin
16 bullets in Malcolm, it happened uptown Manhattan
And the homicide, Reagan '80s epidemic of crack
And soldiers in action dying in Iraq and never coming back
And now let's

The Way I am vs Media Midgets

The way I am- Eminem
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQvteoFiMlg&nohtml5=False
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, "oh, it's his lyrical content
The song "Guilty Conscience" has gotten such rotten responses"
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin
Where were the parents at and look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned
Media Midgets- Ra the rugged man
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b04Elfud97I&nohtml5=False
See, you ain't rocking for instance
You popping, but you robbing hip hop of traditions
You ain't rappers, you more like crooked politicians
Part of who's creation, new nation
Trying to fuck us with no lubrication
Raping, never losing to Lucifer Satan
Calling me Canaan the caveman in the cave, came close but never caved in
The false image of a prophet you praising
You living in a nation living in intidimation
Due to primitive media manipulation
Terror tactics and intidimation, we lack innovation
Looking for more fame they control your brain
The gullible puppets of the public get played like a board game
Get your jaw reconstructed, I ain't no puppet
Ain't throwing up no diamonds, here's the middle finger, go shove it

Renegade vs Change Gonna Come

Renegade- Eminem
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with em a minute
Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference: they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment, nah nah
That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go, he's {​*Jigga j-Jigga*}​
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass, it's just the
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
As a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat; who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do, I'm just a kid from the gutter
Making this butter off these bloodsuckers
Cause I'm a muthafuckin'
Change gonna come- RA the rugged man
Https://youtu.be/_0mYlvhPAQ4?t=155
Criminal acts in the dark doubling, the hearts suffering
The odds I'm duckin' 'em, all this hatred towards God is troubling
Savages living sacrilegious, a bunch of babbling bitches
Satan disguised as media attacking the scriptures, attracting the lizards
Demons accusing the righteous of being the bigots
And brainwashed children in society believing the critics
Killing, living in a sin, and sittin' in a cell in prison
Lacking of independent thinking is sickening
Stop following the public opinion
They tricking you to support the corrupt system
Keeping your thoughts limited, inhibited with no knowledge or wisdom
I'm breaking the demon, the fake heathen, it's Hate Season
Any snake deceiving, I'll make sure they no longer ain't breathing
Was I born a savage and having to sin
Can they mentally and morally civilize a savage and make him a king?
Making the misfortunate forfeit, poisoning the piss-poor kids
Bio-hazardous chemicals out the sink faucets
When the moon turn red, that's the end and everybody dies
Meteor-showers and lambs with 7 horns and 7 eyes
Putting and end to earth's evils, six-wing creatures
Four different kinds with faces of lions, ox's and eagles
Come on

Headlights- Eminem
Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bDLIV96LD4&nohtml5=False
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleanin' Out My Closet"
At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault and I'm not making jokes
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow and I'm way too old to cry
The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma, once you pulled up
In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back and
I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess
I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar cause you're my ma

Yo, part good samaritan, part criminal, a master with weapons
Nice with his hands, he was Rugged Man the original
As children we saw you losing your sanity
Even though we watched you struggle financially
You kept the love in the family
Daddy, I'm thinking about you every day though
I can see you holding a machine gun in heaven with angel wings and a halo
You was always quick to pick a pocket
You're the only one in heaven
Probably slick enough to pull off stealing God's wallet
In life the Lord ain't really deal you a fair one
I watched you bury your baby boy, your daughter and your grandson
You lived one hell of a life from being highly decorated
To being homeless sleeping in the park with your pregnant wife
If I acted up in the restaurant I knew I was being brave
Cause you'd take me to the bathroom and spank me 'til I knew how to behave
Taught me prayers at night and you'd tell me Bible stories
Taught me history, Crazy Horse and his tribal glories
How many times as a kid I seen you handcuffed by the cops?
You taught us black music, Sam Cooke, The Drifters, The Four Tops
Taught me about boxing, Ray Leonard and Larry Holmes
Around the same time you left my mother for Debbie Jones
I told the world your true story and after the record got made
Uncommon Valor, some said I dropped the verse of the decade
Everywhere you went you would tell the world about your son Rugged Man
You was so proud of me, daddy, you was my number one fan
You was always bragging about me to no purpose
On your deathbed you'd play my Mayweather interview for the nurses
Losing you, daddy, it hurt more than any physical pain
You was too young when the cancer went from your throat and into your brain
You was my teacher, my idol, I worshipped you, you was the best, daddy
You lived a tough life, now get some rest, daddy
I love you daddy
