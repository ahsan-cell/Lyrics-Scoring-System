Gyal take time, make your body move slow

[Verse 1: Konan]
Pretty girls wanna pattern with man
But you're bae watching like Pamela An'
She like “what's that smell?” - That's Paco Rabanne
Have you ever had to drive with a pack on a ban?
Big bumper fitting in jeans
I’m like OMG, kissing my teeth
If you ever knew what my shop did in a week (mad)
All I do is talk money, that's a figure of speech
When I slide ‘round
Forget your eyebrows, come back it up like your iCloud
Lay the pipe down
Now your roommates telling you to pipe down
You might also like[Chorus: ZieZie]
Gyal take time, make your body move slow
I like your money move, let me take control

I'm about my money (I'm about, I'm about)
She not gon’ chop my money (she not gon' chop my money)
I'm about my money (I'm about, I'm about)
Never gon’ chop my money
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah my money

[Verse 2: Krept]
No more talking
Can I hit it in the morning?
Halfway, you're screaming out
I ain’t even put it all in
Hit it right, now you're having trouble walking
I shoulda given you a warning
That’s a damn shame
Skrr-Skrr in a Rover
Ayy, your body shapes ain’t Cola
Ayy, Your best friend tryna cock-block
Man I hope she get Ebola
Ayy, girls keep asking for my government
Why you wanna know? You ain’t a government
The whole team here, why you cuffin’ it?
Damn shame, no sucka shit, ayy
