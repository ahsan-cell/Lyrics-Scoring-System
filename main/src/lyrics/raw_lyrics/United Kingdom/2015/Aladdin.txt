So we just roll in
Show kicked off, so we just rolled in
We too loud, so the zoot be what we rollin'
Dead ting, it ain't me that she's phonin'
She must be zonin', nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I am so fly, like Aladdin
I steer the ship, I'm the captain
And niggas they're talkin', they're chattin'
But they cannot play with the captain, no
I am so fly, like Aladdin
I steer the ship, I'm the captain
And niggas they're talkin', they're chattin'
But they cannot play with the captain, no

[Chorus]
So we roll in and roll out
Me and my dargs when we just roll in and roll out
Yeah, I bopped through with the team and roll in and roll out
Money in the bank, so we just roll in and roll out
I'll give them somethin' they don't know about

[Verse 2]
Baddest kid up in this ting, I don't know why they can't see
Did this ting up with my guys, I don't need new yutes 'round me
And I'm the golden child in this ting, when you're talkin' bout Hackney
Told them yutes that I'ma blow, how could they ever doubt me?
Man I get a kick out of kickin' these niggas out the game
Hate when they wanna indirect, but can't say my name, ah
And I would've told you to come and tell me to my face
But you ain't reachin' my heights (No, no)
Nor are you reachin' my face, yeah-ee

I am so fly, like Aladdin
I steer the ship, I'm the captain
[And niggas they're talking, they're chatting
But they cannot play with the captain, no]
I am so fly, like Aladdin
I steer the ship, I'm the captain
And niggas they're talkin', they're chattin'
But they cannot play with the captain, no

[Chorus]
So we roll in and roll out
Me and my dargs when we just roll in and roll out
Yeah, I bopped through with the team and roll in and roll out
Money in the bank, so we just roll in and roll out
I'll give them somethin' they don't know about

[Verse 3]
I told them niggas there, keep talkin' their shit 'cause I don't mind
I see them niggas, they've been tweetin' their shit, but I don't mind
'Cause I been on a roll, on a roll, I don't mind
I told them niggas there, keep talkin' their shit 'cause I don't mind
So I tell them kick back, kick back
Ammi too loud on my team so we kick back, then we hit that
Yeah, the Ammi too loud and my team, so we hit that, hit that
Only Too Loud on my team so we kick back, yeah, we kick back
Yeah, only Too Loud on my team
[Chorus]
So we roll in and roll out
Me and my dargs when we just roll in and roll out
Yeah, I bopped through with the team and roll in and roll out
Money in the bank, so we just roll in and roll out
I'll give them somethin' they don't know about

[Outro]
So we roll in and roll out
Me and my dargs when we just roll in and roll out
Yeah, I bopped through with the team and roll in and roll out
Money in the bank, so we just roll in and roll out
I'll give them somethin' they don't know about
I am so fly like Aladdin
But they cannot play with the captain, no
I am so fly like Aladdin
But they cannot play with the captain, no3
