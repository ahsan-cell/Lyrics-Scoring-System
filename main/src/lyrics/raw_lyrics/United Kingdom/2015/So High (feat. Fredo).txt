Preditah
Uh
(I get, so high)
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i)

[Chorus: Fredo]
(I get so high) Girl, you're a groupie, no need to lie
(I get so high) Get so, so high, 'til you feel to fly
(I get so high) She's so, so shy, until the night
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i) I was last year and I'm still the guy

[Verse 1: MIST]
Throw some sauce 'pon 'dem
So high, time to walk 'pon 'dem
Yeah, I do set trends
Talk too much get sticky for you friends, send a hitta to your ends
I don't dance, I ain't movin' my feet
Uh, 'cause I'm dancin' with heat
Bad B's got my tunes on repeat
Do it with ease, out 'ere tripling P's
Back to my grindin' again (I'm back)
Writin', rhymin' again
Firing skengs, yeah it's Fred yet again
Manna put a line in your ends (Fred again)
Aggy, so much gold it's chavvy
'Dem man are chatty like gyally
Big .44 called Maggie
What's my cologne? Creed and Cali

[Verse 2: Fredo & MIST]
Yo, I've been stuck with my booty call
Furthermore, I fell in love with my booty call (Woah)
Girl, you got junk, know your boot is full
In the eyes of a thug, that is beautiful (Real)
When I'm on tour, you know who to call (Hm)
I'm in Tom Ford, this ain't suitable (Uh)
Diamonds, handbags, you suit it all (Real)
Kilos, gram packs, we move it all
"Ay, Mist, are you takin' the piss?" (Why?)
I swear you got a ring, that is made for a wrist (Ha!)
I swear I got a ting, that is made for my lips (Real)
I got a gun for him, I ain't making a diss
Gettin' so, so high, they hatin'
I can't say I don't know why (Ahaha)
I'm feelin' scared when the po roll by (Why?)
'Cause me and the bros got a pole close by (Yeah)
Bang!

[Chorus: Fredo]
(I get so high) Girl, you're a groupie, no need to lie
(I get so high) Get so, so high, 'til you feel to fly
(I get so high) She's so, so shy, until the night
(Temperature ri-i-i-i-i-i-i) I was last year and I'm still the guy
[Outro: MIST]
(I get so high)
