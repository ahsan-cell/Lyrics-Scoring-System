Hey, turn the bass up
Hey, turn the bass up
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass

[Chorus]
I don't need no speed (No)
I don't need no heroin (No thanks)
I don't want no coke (Not today)
You can keep your ketamine (Yeah)
I'm a bassline junkie (What?)
I'm a bassline junkie (Tell 'em again)
I'm a bassline junkie (Tell 'em again)
And I like it funky

[Post-Chorus]
What the fuck? What are you doing?
Don't touch it
Don'tâ€“
Who told you to touch it? I will fucking kill you
Don't ever touch that fucking shit again

I'm a fiend for a big dirty bassline
When I hear one, I have a great time
A bit of bottom end's all what I require
I let the bassline take me higher
My friends think that it's a bad habit
But I'm just like fuck you, damn it
If you take my bass away
I'll blow your fucking face away (Easy!)
You might think I'm over the top
But when I hear that bassline drop (What!)
I just can't control my actions
But I still feel satisfaction
So don't come around here whinging
I just wanna hear the bassline rinsin'
Or we can just skank out all day
If not get the fuck out my way

[Chorus]
I don't need no speed (No)
I don't need no heroin (No thanks)
I don't want no coke (Not today)
You can keep your ketamine (Yeah)
I'm a bassline junkie (What?)
I'm a bassline junkie (Tell 'em again)
I'm a bassline junkie (Tell 'em again)
And I like it funky
[Refrain]
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty dirty stinking
Big dirty stinking bass, dirty stinking bass
Big dirty stinking bass, bass, bass, bass, bass

[Verse 2]
The other day I got an ASBO order
And I think it's well out of order
All my neighbors throwing a fit
So I told them suck my dick
And I told them I got the power
And I turn the music up louder
All night till six in the morning
Old bastards, they're just boring
You know me, I'm the bassline father
Nobody can't tell me nada
And the police turned up and they took me
We drove out to the nick and they booked me
When they said they'd give me a caution
If I didn't give them no distortion
But I said don't bother, I'm guilty
And my bassline's fucking filthy

[Chorus]
I don't need no speed (No)
I don't need no heroin (No thanks)
I don't want no coke (Not today)
You can keep your ketamine (Yeah)
I'm a bassline junkie (What?)
I'm a bassline junkie (Tell 'em again)
I'm a bassline junkie (Tell 'em again)
And I like it funky
[Outro]
