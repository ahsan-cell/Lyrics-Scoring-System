Yo, Wiley, Conor Maynard, Animal

[Refrain: Wiley]
Can't believe my eyes, yeah, she's winning
She's another one of them beautiful women
Take a look like ten, ten, ten
She in a skin-tight dress, all fitted
Eyes like Cat Woman, knows I want her
I'm looking back so she knows I'm on her
Animal instinct, for real
Drive her crazy, she knows the deal

[Verse 1: Conor Maynard]
Looking for a girl that was here but now she's gone
Felt so good even though she did me wrong
She knows what I want but she's bad for me
She gets what she wants when she's touching me
I shoulda known better but she took my self control

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
You can take my heart like a criminal
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
Girl, tear me apart like an animal
Like an animal, animal

I know I'm getting close from the trail of broken hearts
Hope she coming back to finish what she started
I never see the claws until she's touching me
She's holding me so tight it's getting hard to breathe
I'll never win the game but it feels too good to care

[Chorus: Conor Maynard]
You can take my heart like a criminal
(Like a criminal, like a criminal)
Won't you make me believe I'm the only one?
(I'm the only one, I'm the only one)
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
Girl, tear me apart like an animal
Like an animal, animal

[Refrain: Wiley]
Can't believe my eyes, yeah, she's winning
She's another one of them beautiful women
Take a look like ten, ten, ten
She in a skin-tight dress, all fitted
Eyes like Cat Woman, knows I want her
I'm looking back so she knows I'm on her
Animal instinct, for real
Drive her crazy, she knows the deal
[Bridge: Wiley & (Conor Maynard)]
(Animal) Yeah, she's winning (Animal)
Beautiful women (Animal)
Ten, ten, ten (Animal)
Skin-tight dress, all fitted
Eyes like Cat Woman, knows I want her
I'm looking back so she knows I'm on her
Animal instinct, for real
Drive her crazy, she knows the deal

[Outro: Conor Maynard]
(You can take my heart like a criminal)
So grab me by the neck and don't you ever let go
Mess me up so good until I'm begging for more
Girl, tear me apart like an animal
Like an animal, animal1
