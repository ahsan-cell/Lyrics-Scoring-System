She captures her reflection, then she throws the mirror to the floor
Her image is distorted, screaming, "Is it worth it anymore?" (No, oh)
Are you scared of the things that they might put you through?
Does it make you wanna hide the inner you?

[Pre-Chorus: Jade, All]
You're not the only one, so let them criticize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
You're untouchable when you realise, oh

[Chorus: All, Leigh-Anne, Perrie, Jade]
Change, change your life, take it all
We're gonna stick together, know wе'll get through it all
Change, change your lifе, take it all (Yeah; Take it all)
You've gotta use it to become what you've always known
Become what you've always known

[Verse 2: Leigh-Anne, Perrie, Jade, Jesy]
His body starts to flicker like nobody wants to know his name (Ooh)
Just another soul with feelings but nobody there to feel the pain (Ooh; No, no, no)
They can rip you, bring you down, down to their size
But they will never get to the heart you hold inside, hmm

[Pre-Chorus: Jade, All]
You're not the only one, so let them criticize (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
You're untouchable when you realise, oh

You've gotta use it to become what you've always known

[Bridge: Leigh-Anne, All, Jade, Perrie]
You got a right to show the world
Something never seen
We wanna hear you scream it out
You're not alone
