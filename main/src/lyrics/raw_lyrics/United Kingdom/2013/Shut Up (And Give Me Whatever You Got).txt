Shut up and give me whatever you got
Shut up and give me whatever you got
I'm trying

[Verse 1]
Oh, yes, my mind is playing tricks on me
It's the same as it's always been
Seeing things out the corner of my eye
Well, are you gonna be my guy?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, do
Waiting for a session and now we feel pressure
Ooh, do
Get some for the rest 'cause you'll never learn your lesson

[Chorus]
You like it a lot
Shut up and give me whatever you got
I'm tired of waiting, baby, can't you take it?
Oh, baby, you're falling apart
Falling in love while I'm breaking your heart
Oh, can't you take this crazy love?
Oh, darling, I'm trying

Oh, yes, my heart is blowing, hot and cold
Sending lightning into my soul
Seeing things out the corner of my eye
So are you gonna be my guy?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, do
Waiting for a session and now we feel pressure
Ooh, do
Get some for the rest 'cause you'll never learn your lesson

[Chorus]
You like it a lot
Shut up and give me whatever you got
I'm tired of waiting, baby, can't you take it?
Oh, baby, you're falling apart
Falling in love while I'm breaking your heart
Oh, can't you take this crazy love?
Oh, darling, I'm trying
Oh, darling, I'm trying

[Bridge]
Turn it up, turn it up, oh-oh
Show the girls what you got, oh-oh
To the right, to the left, oh-oh
Is that the best that I'm gonna get? Oh-oh
[Chorus]
Shut up and give me whatever you got
You like it a lot
Shut up and give me whatever you got (Whatever you got)
I'm tired of waiting, baby, can't you take it?
Oh, baby, you're falling apart
Falling in love while I'm breaking your heart
Oh, can't you take this crazy love?
Oh, darling
Oh, darling, I'm trying
Oh, darling, I'm trying

[Outro]
Shut up and give me whatever you got1
