Hey, hey
You're almost home, you're almost home
You're almost home

[Verse 1]
I've seen the light in the sky
In disguise like fireflies
Burning bright just to vanish in the dark
I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom I believe in, in my heart

[Pre-Chorus 1]
'Cause underneath the good
There's something greater than you know

[Chorus]
When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home
Oh-oh-oh
(You're almost home)

When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from is like some other universe
You count your steps like they're regrets
You catch one breath and lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know

[Chorus]
When you're almost there
And you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go
When you're almost there
Almost home
Know you're not alone
You're almost home
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
When you let your heart be the compass
(It always leads you home)
You won't get lost
Not if you trust it
(It always leads you home)
When you hear the sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before
Ooh
[Chorus]
Oh, when you're almost there
Almost home
Just open up your eyes and go, go

Almost home
Know you're not alone
