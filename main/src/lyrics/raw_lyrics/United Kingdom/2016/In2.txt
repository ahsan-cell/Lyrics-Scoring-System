Woo, uh
I'm just in my zone

[Chorus: Haile]
You'd be lyin' if you said I wasn't
Something that you're into, into (yeah)
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends
You know what I'm into, into
Don't need to hide it
You could be mine, let's take it slow
Man he's a hater
I'll let it slide, I came for you
You'd be lyin' if you said I wasn't
Something that you're into, into
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends
You know what I'm into, into
Don't need to hide it
You could be mine, let's take it slow
Man he's a hater
I'll let it slide, I came for you

[Verse 1: Akelle]
Oh yeah, when I was in a party it was on me
I remember it all, it was last week
When I stepped in it was half three
Hennessy did spill on your jeans (get the cleaner)
Do you remember asking me what I'm into?
I replied "music, baby, follow my Insta"
Show you what I'm into, deep's what I'm into
All of you two-faced friends, yeah, I've been true
You'd be lying if you said I wasn't something you were into
(Just tell me the truth girl)
You lying to yourself, I told you my name is Akelle
Been in and out of girls, must be able to tell
I've been dyin' for a chance to tell you I'm into you
(Just tell me the truth girl)
Just tell me you like me (tell me you like me)
Tell me you want me, yeah, yeah!

[Verse 2: Louis Rei]
Listen
You'd be lyin' if you said I wasn't something you was into
Mama warned you about this shit too
Bet she did
Never been one for them to settle with
Cellophane, wrappin' it up as soon as I get with it
Menacin', men have seen all the crud that I'm steppin' with
Celibate, what are these words?
Not comprehendin' it
Ending it, mashing the works, that's where your belly get
Trembling, baby you ready, that's how I end 'em
[Bridge: Louis Rei & Haile]
You'd stuntin' in front of your friends
You know what I'm into (into), into, (into)
Call me domino, follow it
Baby girl that's what your kid do (kid do)
So won't you take a stroll with me, girl? (me girl)
No stress off this, hold me girl
'Cause I can make you scream (I can make you scream)
Just put your trust in me

[Chorus: Haile]
You'd be lyin' if you said I wasn't
Something that you're into, into (yeah)
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends
You know what I'm into, into
Don't need to hide it
You could be mine, let's take it slow
Man he's a hater
I'll let it slide, I came for you
You'd be lyin' if you said I wasn't
Something that you're into, into
Don't be stuntin' in front of your friends
You know what I'm into, into
Don't need to hide it
You could be mine, let's take it slow
Man he's a hater
I'll let it slide, I came for you
[Outro: Haile]
We ridin'
It's time I decided
Forget all the pride and
You're in for a surprisin'
We ridin'
It's time I decided
Na-na-na
Woah, yeah14
