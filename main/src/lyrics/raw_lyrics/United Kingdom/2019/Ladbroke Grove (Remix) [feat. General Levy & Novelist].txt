Now, some interesting news: even though Ed Sheeran didn't release any music in 2018, he's still the UK's most-played artist of that year. Ed's been in the top for the past three years. Meanwhile, listeners in the UK loved UK music in 2018, with only one foreign artist having a place in the charts.

Some more charts for you, this time the radio airplay charts! Ed Sheeran was top of these as well, but he didn't have the most-played song; this spot was held by Portugal the Man's "Feel it Still".  Jess Glynne's "These Days" came in second; she's appeared in the top ten radio airplay charts four times in the last five years!
