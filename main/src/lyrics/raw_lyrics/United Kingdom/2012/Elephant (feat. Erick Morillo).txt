You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it, it, it, hey
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it, it, it

[Verse 1]
How you doing? How was your day?
Small talk, small talk you wanna play?
You getting further, further away
No kiss, no hug, just blank

[Refrain]
And I just can't figure out, uh
How it all turned upside down
And when I look at you right now
It's strange 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I know something's going on
That's going on with you
I think you should tell me
You've got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Ah, there's an elephant standing in the room
Ah, though we're all alone
It's not just me and you
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it, it, it, hey
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it?
There's an elephant in the room
You might also like[Verse 2]
Oh, you wanna, wanna explain?
Well your talk is cheap, cheap, just sayin'
You say you're sorry, say you're to blame
And you promise and you swear you'll change

[Refrain]
And I just can't figure out, uh
How it all turned upside down
And when I look at you right now
It's strange 'cause...

[Pre-Chorus]
I know something's going on
That's going on with you
I think you should tell me
You've got nothing left to lose

[Chorus]
Ah, there's an elephant standing in the room
Ah, though we're all alone
It's not just me and you
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it, it, it, hey
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it?
There's an elephant in the room
[Bridge]
And it's crushing me, there's no room to breathe
Got me backed against the wall like that
And I just can't see, 'cause it's blinding me
Got me cornered so I can't relax
Oh, ooh, oh
Ah

[Outro]
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it, it, it, hey
You wanna talk, you wanna talk about it
Wanna talk, you wanna talk about it, it, it, hey
There's an elephant in the room
