Uh, oh uh
Oh oh oh, uh uh
We're on the rocket

[Verse 1]
Baby baby, we're on the rocket
Venus and Mars now, can't be apart now
Baby baby, put me in your pocket
We're on a mission, get in position

[Pre-Chorus]
Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
When you turn it on I can go for hours
Hit the switch, push the button, baby, then you'll see
We can have it all, baby, you and me

[Chorus]
Kiss the stars tonight
You and me, oh, we will
Write our name in lights
They will see we're in love tonight
Love tonight, we're in love tonight
Love tonight, love tonight
We're in love tonight

[Verse 2: Pixie Lott]
Baby baby, we're on the rocket
Wherever we land, you'll be my spaceman
Baby baby, we're supersonic
Now we're together, we'll last forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
When you turn it on I can go for hours
Hit the switch, push the button, baby, then you'll see
We can have it all, baby, you and me

[Chorus]
Kiss the stars tonight
You and me, oh, we will
Write our name in lights
They will see we're in love tonight
Love tonight, we're in love tonight
Love tonight, love tonight
We're in love tonight

[Bridge]
Put the plug in the socket, give me all your power
When you turn it on I can go for hours
Hit the switch, push the button, baby, then you'll see
We can have it all, baby, you and me
We-we-we can have it all, baby, you and me
We-we-we can have it all, baby, you and me, you and me, you and me...
[Chorus]
Kiss the stars tonight (Kiss)
You and me, oh, we will (The stars tonight)
Write our name in lights
They will see we're in love tonight
Love tonight, we're in love tonight (We're in love tonight)
Love tonight, love tonight
We're in love tonight

[Outro]
We're on the rocket
We-we're on the rocket
