A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
There gonna rip it off
Takin' their time right behind my back
And I'm talking to myself at night, because I can't forget
Back and fourth through my mind behind a cigarette
And a message coming from my bones
Says leave it alone
Leave it alone
Say leave it alone
Oh leave it alone
Don't wanna hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone know's about it
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell
And if I catch you coming by my way, I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear, but that's what I'll do
And a feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home
Oh find a home
Find a home
Find a home
C'mon
I'm gonna find my home
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
Gonna rip it off
And a feeling coming from my bones
Says find a home
Find a home
Go back home
Go back home
You betta go back homeYou might also like
