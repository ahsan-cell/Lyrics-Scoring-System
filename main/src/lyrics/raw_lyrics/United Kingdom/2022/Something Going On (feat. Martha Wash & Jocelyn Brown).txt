Feeling good in every way
Feel the spirit here tonight
'Round and 'round and let it go
And I'm here to let you know
There's something feeling good in my soul
As the rhythm starts to grind
If you feel it like I do
Stomp your feet and let me know
Something's goin' on in your soul
(Moving and grooving, smoothing in my soul, in my soul!)

Something's goin' on in your soul
Feeling good in every way
Feeling good in every way
Feeling good in every way
Feeling good in every way

Something's goin' on in your soul
