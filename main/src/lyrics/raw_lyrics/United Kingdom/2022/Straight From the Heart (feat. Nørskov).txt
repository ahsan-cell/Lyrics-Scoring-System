Straight from the heart (Mm)
(Mm-mm-mm)
Straight from the heart (Mm)
(Mm-mm-mm)
(The whole world's going to love it)

[Verse 1]
Give me your heart, give me your soul
Give me your mind, give me your love
I want it all
Give me your pain, I'll give you patience
Every day, whatever it takes
I'll do it all, all

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, I be saving it all for you
I believe in it, we're the truth
Girl, I want you so loud
(Say it like you mean it)
And ooh, I be shouting it from the roof
Got me feeling something brand new
It was you from the start
It's coming straight from the heart

[Chorus]
There's nothing that can beat us together
Ain't no one that can keep us apart
This love that we have got is forever
It's true and it comes straight from the heart

Straight from the heart (Mm)
(Mm-mm-mm, mm)
Can't keep us apart (Mm)
(Mm-mm-mm)

[Verse 2]
Something so big, bigger than us
Made out of trust
Baby, we got something so real
Something so strong, holding it up
Pushing us on, tell me I'm wrong
That's how I feel, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And ooh, I be saving it all for you
I believe in it, we're the truth
Girl, I want you so loud
(Say it like you mean it)
And ooh, I be shouting it from the roof
Got me feeling something brand new
It was you from the start
It's coming straight from the heart

[Chorus]
There's nothing that can beat us together
Ain't no one that can keep us apart
This love that we have got is forever
It's true and it comes straight from the heart
[Post-Chorus]
Straight from the heart (Mm)
(Mm-mm-mm, mm)
Can't keep us apart (Mm)
(Mm-mm-mm)

[Bridge]
I'll be right here to catch you if you fall
There's no need to doubt when we are together
And I knew right from the start
That I would give my heart to you
Don't you worry 'cause I will be right by your side

[Chorus]
'Cause I will be there
I will be there
So much that we share
I will be there (Ooh)
I will be there
