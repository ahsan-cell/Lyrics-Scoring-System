Put 'em high, push it high
Ba-ber-bom-bom, bom-ba-ber-bom-bom
Put 'em high, push it high

Baby, let me need me
Those were the words you gave me
Never felt this way before
Your love tastes like ah-ha

And baby, I don't care where you've been before
Just put 'em high, put 'em high
Make the best of it, just a little bit
Just put 'em high and put 'em high

Ba-ber-bom-bom, ba-ber-bom-bom
Put 'em high, push it high
Ba-ber-bom-bom, bom-ba-ber-bom-bom
Put 'em high, push it high

Baby, let me need me
Those were the words you gave me
Never felt this way before
Your love tastes like ah-ha

And baby, I don't care where you've been before
Just put 'em high, put 'em high
Make the best of it, just a little bit
Just put 'em high and put 'em high
You might also likeBaby, I don't care where you've been before
Just put 'em high, put 'em high
Make the best of it, just a little bit
Just put 'em high and put 'em high

Baby, I don't care where you've been before
If you put 'em high, put 'em high
Gotta put 'em high
Baby, I don't care where you've been before

Listen, gotta listen to me when I say yeah
"Ba-ber-bom-bom, ba-ber-bom-bom
Ba-ber-bom-bom, ba-ber-bom-bom"
