Moving on, moving on, you can't kill my vibe
Not a tear’s gonna fall from my eyes
No time for tears

[Verse 1: Jade]
I was feeling broken hearted
Until I pressed restart yeah
I'm moving on moving on, don't wanna hit rewind
I was sad before, but not anymore

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
I don’t need your sorry
This ain't a pity party
I'm not tryna be funny
But I ain't got the time babe

[Chorus: Perrie]
No time for tears, I won't be crying
Don't need you here, I'm doing fine yeah
You see I'm moving on moving on, you can’t kill my vibe
Not a tear’s gonna fall from my eyes
No time for tears, I won't be crying
Don’t need you here, I'm doing fine, yeah
You see, I'm moving on, moving on, you can't kill my vibe
Not a tear’s gonna fall from my eyes

Thought you were gonna see me down
I ain't repeating you, so I'm deleting you from my phone now
You ain't gonna see me cry
I might go kiss somebody new
Just 'cause I feel like
So over this, so over you
You

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne, Jesy]
No I don't need your sorry
This ain't a pity party (This ain't a pity party)
