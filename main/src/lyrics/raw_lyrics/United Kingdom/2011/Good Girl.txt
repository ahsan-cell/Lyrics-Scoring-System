I like tight jeans
Dark shades
When I walk, the ground shakes (boom)
Like an 808 (boom)

You appreciate my lean body
Nice shape
Wanna take me on a date (move)
You've got what it takes (move)
You better have some cake

[Hook:]
I like
How I'm catching your eyes
I like
How I don't even try
I like you
I like you, boy
I like you, boy

[Chorus:]
You might mistake me for heart breaker
'Cause there's blood on the floor
I'm hoping you will see
There's something good in me
Never seen before
You might also likeMight mistake me for a heart breaker
'Cause there's blood on the floor
I know you're shaking me
My heart is there for keeps
There's an open door

I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good girl
But I've been bad before

Good girl
I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good, good girl
I know I can be a good girl
But I've been bad before
Good girl, but I've been bad before

[Verse 2:]
I chew bubble gum and talk fast
Switch up to high class (grooves)
On my day to day (grooves)

On these 28's
My... hydraulics bump hard
But I can't kiss a car (lose)
If you walk away (lose)
This could be your day
[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]1
