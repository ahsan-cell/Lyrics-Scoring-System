J.R
B-Day Boy
Ha-ha

[Hook: Mann, 50 Cent]
Man, I feel like money (Man, I feel like money, yeah)
They're attracted to me (Oh, yeah)
They come around like honey (They come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee (Oh, yeah, say what?)
Man, I got 'em all buzzin', buzzin', buzzin', buzzin' (Buzzin, buzzin, buzzin)
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Man, I got the world buzzin', buzzin' (Say what?), buzzin', buzzin' (Buzzin', buzzin', buzzin')
Like da-da-da-da-da-da-da

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Audi R8, laid back, Black on Black
Diamonds on my neck and my wrist matching that
Black mask, black mag, brown bag
Drop that off, nigga, shoot your black ass
I'm a magnet to money, the paper I'm where it's at
They attracted to me, they treat me like Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P, your chick just chose me
I got so much swag, is that why you mad?
Control your hatred, nothing good to say, don't say shit
Keep walkin', quit talkin', keep it movin'
We can keep the club jumpin' 'till daylight
From New York to LA through the Bay right

Uh, back up to back up in the mix like that
And I know ya like it when it's just like that
All the girlies just love my swag
From my kicks to the way I fix my hat
I'm back, fresh like some new J's
Brodie got next NBA 2K, I'm too paid
Shaded with some ladies
Reppin' my city, West LA baby !
West LA made me this way
Two rules - Stay fresh, homie and get paid (hey!)
Never broke and never bummy
I'm from where it's forever sunny

[Hook: Mann]
Man, I feel like money (Man, I feel like money)

[Bridge: Mann]
When I come around, 'round, 'round, they go
Yeah , yeah it's going down , down , down, they go
[Verse 3: Mann]
New cat with a old school feel
Only new artist with a old school deal
Taught the game by Steve Lobell
So we always win , don't receive no help
New girls act like they know me so well
But I shows no love and be like "Oh well"
When my album drops , sure as hell goin' sell
Stack cash and laugh like L-O-L

[Hook: Mann]
Man, I feel like money (Man, I feel like money)
They're attracted to me (Oh, yeah)
They come around like honey (They come around like honey)
Cuz I'm fly like a bee (Oh, yeah)

Saying all the things that I wanna hear
