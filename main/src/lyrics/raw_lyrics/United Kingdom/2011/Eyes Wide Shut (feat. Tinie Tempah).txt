They say that some things are too good to be true
But I just hope they ain't talking about you
I heard that everything must come to an end
But I just can't imagine me without you

[Chorus: JLS]
Don't tell me I'm dreamin'
Cause if I've been dreamin'
I don't ever wanna wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut
Cause I don't wanna wake up, wake up, wake up
I don't ever want to wake up, wake up, wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut

[Verse 2: Marvin Humes and Aston Merrygold]
Out of sight they say out of mind
But your image will remain til the end of time
I'm strong but hearts are easy to break
Don't wanna fall if there ain't no one to catch me
Me without you, me without you
Oh, I don't ever want to wake up
You might also like[Chorus: JLS]
Don't tell me I'm dreamin'
Cause if I've been dreamin'
I don't ever want to wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut
Cause I don't wanna wake up, wake up, wake up
I don't ever want to wake up, wake up, wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut

[Verse 3: Tinie Tempah]
Ah, and I don't wanna get out of bed
If I could re-arrange the alphabet
It'd be U, I, J.L.S
B.A. to J.F.K., L.A.X
Yeah, who's a match made?
Tell me looking forward to it like a Saturday, ha-ha
Babe, tonight's about us, I got my Ray-Bans on and my eyes wide shut

[Bridge: JLS]
Everybody everywhere throw your hands in the air say yeah
Go on put your hands high if you ain't sleepin' tonight say yeah
Tonight I'll be sleeping
[Chorus: JLS]
Don't tell me I'm dreamin'
Cause if I've been dreamin'
I don't ever want to wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut
Cause I don't wanna wake up, wake up, wake up
I don't ever want to wake up, wake up, wake up
So in love with this feelin'
Tonight I'll be sleepin'
Sleepin' with my eyes wide shut

[Outro: JLS]
Everybody everywhere throw your hands in the air say yeah
Go on put your hands high if you ain't sleepin' tonight say yeah
