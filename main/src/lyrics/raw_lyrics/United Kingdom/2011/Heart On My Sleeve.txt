You think you've heard this before
I'll try to say it differently
As long as it comes naturally to me
It's been making me sad
'Cause I can't find a better way
To speak the words I wanna say to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Know how I love you
And know how I need you

[Chorus]
And I want you to know
Won't let you down
No, I can't let go
And I want you to see
Every day I wear my heart on my sleeve
On my sleeve

[Verse 2]
It's been driving me mad
Consistent tones and constant drones
Keep pulling me back inside my head
Nothing matters at all
The world will keep on spinning 'round
All these feelings keep on pouring out

Oh, how I need you

[Chorus]
And I want you to know
Won't let you down
No, I can't let go
And I want you to see
Every day I wear my heart on my sleeve, oh

[Bridge]
I try to write the words down, ooh
Before they're lost and won't come out
Oh, please, help me sing my song

[Chorus]
And I want you to know
Won't let you down
No, I can't let go
And I want you to see
Every day I wear my heart on my sleeve
Heart on my sleeve
Heart on my sleeve
Heart on my sleeve, yeah
[Outro]
No, I can't let you go
Can't let you go
Oh, I want you to know
I won't let you down
Every day, yeah, I can't let go
I wear my heart on my sleeve
