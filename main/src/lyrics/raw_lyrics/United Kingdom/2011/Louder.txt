1, 2

[Verse 1 - Jessica]
This could be like Romeo, Juliet
A tender love we won't regret
I feel the way you're feeling too
But baby, I need more volume

[Verse 2 - Sian]
I need to hear your heart go boom
Flying a rocket, rock the room
Do it as bad as MJ did
Baby, don't whisper what you're saying

[Pre-Chorus - Emily]
Just imagine us now but with a little more power
We'd be thundering
We could make it so hot, and we'll be living it up
So tell me one thing

(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)

[Chorus]
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Pump that bass under my feet
Feel that rhythm, your heart beat, beat
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Turn it up, boy, boy, turn it up, boy
Turn it up, boy, boy, turn it up, boy

I gotta get a rush
So I need to say your love is dangerous
Right now you're pushing zero on the meter
So go connect your body to a speaker, ooh

[Vese 4 - Bianca]
I need emotion, you don't need to worry about caution
I wanna push your level to destruction
I wouldn't really care how much I've missed
'Cause I can handle, handle this

[Pre-Chorus - Emily]
Just imagine us now but with a little more power
We'd be thundering
We could make it so hot, and we'd be living it up
So tell me one thing

(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up)

[Chorus]
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Pump that bass under my feet
Feel that rhythm, your heart beat, beat
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Turn it up, boy, boy, turn it up, boy (turn it up)
Turn it up, boy, boy, turn it up, boy (turn it up, boy)
Turn it up, boy, boy, turn it up, boy (turn it up)
Turn it up, boy, boy, turn it up, boy (turn it up)
[Hook - All]
Are you getting to my heart?
Are you really getting to ma, to ma heart? Yeah
Eh, yeah, are you getting to my heart
Dude you're really getting to ma, to ma heart

[Bridge - Bianca]
You got to try, always try keeping me
Boy if you're finding it easy to leave
I won't be missing you like you're missing me
And when I'm gone, you'll be wanting to scream, oh!

[Chorus]
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
Pump that bass under my feet
Feel that rhythm, your heart beat, beat
Turn it up louder, louder, louder
