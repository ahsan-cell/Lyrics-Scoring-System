Don't hold your breath

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 1]
I was under your spell for such a long time, couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart, tore me apart with all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had but I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back but no, those days are gone, my friend
I loved you so much that I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Verse 2]
I was worried about you but you never cared about me none
You took my money and I know that you, you could kill someone
I gave you everything but nothing was ever enough
You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold your breath

[Bridge]
Move on (Move on), don't look back (Don't look back)
I jumped off the train runnin' off the tracks
Your day's gone (Your day's gone), face the facts (Face the facts)
A bad movie ends and the screen fades to black
[Refrain]
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
(You can't touch me now)

[Chorus]
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath (Don't hold your breath, no)
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath (Breath)
You can't touch me now
There's no feeling left
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath (Don't hold)
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath (Ooh)3
