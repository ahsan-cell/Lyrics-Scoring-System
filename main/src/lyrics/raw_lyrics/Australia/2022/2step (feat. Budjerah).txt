I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

[Verse 2: Budjerah]
We can stay up till the sunrise, kick it in the late night
Just you and me, don't have to be shy, baby
Don't be shy, baby
It's a time like this, baby
Free my mind with a kiss, I'm in bliss
Yeah, this is Heaven, baby
And I don't wanna miss what we have right now
So tell me, would you stay up? (Stay up)
Late night, talkin' till we make trust (Make trust)
Baby, tell me, would you be the one, be my one? (Be the one)

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all
[Post-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us to go all night
