I remember the day that we met
You were like a light I didn't know that I needed
You had a smile that could warm up the New York cold
It wasn't long till we both caught feelings
I didn't know that we both had demons, but
It's funny how time reveals it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And you stayed out that night after we had a fight
And my friends say they saw you with him
At that bar where we met while I'm here in our bed
Do you even regret what you did?

[Chorus]
'Cause it was never meant to end like this
Standin' in thе rain in your black dress
So go ahead and tell mе what I did to deserve this
And I'm not sayin' we were perfect
I hope that one night with him was worth it
But tellin' me that it was a mistake don't make it hurt less
It don't make it hurt less

[Verse 2]
I'm standing there as you list off your reasons
Made me feel like a fool for believin'
You reach for my hand as I turn to leave
But you keep on holdin' on

And your eyes started fallin' way down with despair
And you turned around and said "This isn't fair
It was only one night, there were no feelings shared"
So I looked in your eyes and I said

[Chorus]
It was never meant to end like this
Standin' in the rain in your black dress
So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this
And I'm not sayin' we were perfect
I hope that one night with him was worth it
But tellin' me that it was a mistake don't make it hurt less
It don't make it hurt less

[Bridge]
I know the day will come when this won't hurt anymore
And all the pain is just an afterthought
If I'm strong enough to let you in, I can let you out again
And I hope some day you'll find someone to love you
Like I did

[Chorus]
'Cause it was never meant to end like this
Standin' in the rain in your black dress
So go ahead and tell me what I did to deserve this
And I'm not sayin' we were perfect
I hope that one night with him was worth it
But tellin' me that it was a mistake don't make it hurt less
It don't make it hurt less
It don't make it hurt less
It don't make it hurt less2
