Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
I'll speak a little louder
I'll even shout
You know that I'm proud
And I can't get the words out

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Niall Horan]
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere

[Verse 2: Niall Horan]
Something's happening
Happening to me
My friends say I'm acting peculiarly
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Niall Horan]
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywherе
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhеre

Can you hear me calling
Out your name?
You know that I'm falling
And I don't know what to say
Come along, baby
We better make a start
You better make it soon
Before you break my heart

[Chorus: Anne-Marie & Niall Horan]
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
Oh I
I wanna be with you everywhere
