Maybe I don't wanna know
The way home
Taking on a journey
I’ve got places to go
Wanna chase a miracle?
It's possible
You just gotta open the door

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling it's cold out there
Don’t fear the road just
Come along with me
You're not alone out there
Let's write a song make up the melody

[Chorus]
If you're looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heart beat
I don't look behind me
Following the sun
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo
Following the sun
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo

Come and give your love away
Don't play it safе
I'ma let you fall but i won't let you break
Wanna chasе a sunset
Are you ready yet?
We won’t get this chance every day

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling it’s cold out there
Don't fear the road just
Come along with me
You’re not alone out there
Let's write a song make up the melody

[Chorus]
If you're looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heart beat
I don't look behind me
Following the sun
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo
Following the sun
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo
Following the sun
[Post-Chorus]
You can lean on...
You can lean on me
You can lean on...
You can lean on me

[Chorus]
If you’re looking for me baby
You know you can find me
Following the sun
Somewhere running up my heart beat
I don't look behind me
Following the sun
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo
Following the sun
Ooo-ooo-ooo, ooo-ooo-ooo
Following the sun

[Post-Chorus]
You can lean on...
You can lean on me
You can lean on...
You can lean on me
