I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty
When you talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Dirty talk

[Verse 1]
Kitten heels, lingerie
Pantyhose, foreplay
Legs up, on the bar
In the back of your car
Latex, champagne
Bubble bath, whipped cream
Cherry pop, tag team
Can you make me scream?

[Pre-Chorus]
Aah, aah
I wanna do some dirty things to you tonight
Aah, aah
I wanna fight, all through the night, night, night

[Chorus]
I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty
When you talk, talk, talk, talk
Dirty talk

Blindfold, feather bed
Tickle me, slippery
G-Spot, nasty pose
In a video
Love machine, by myself
Climax, hot wax
S&M on the floor
I like it hardcore

[Pre-Chorus]
Aah, aah
I wanna do some dirty things to you tonight
Aah, aah
I wanna fight, all through the night, night, night

[Chorus]
I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty
When you talk, dirty talk, talk
I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty
When you dirty talk
[Bridge]
Can you go down?
Are you up for it, baby?
Can you turn me out?
Are you up for it? Talk to me
Talk to me, talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Won't you talk to me?
Talk to me, talk dirty to me
Talk dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty
Dirty talk

[Chorus]
I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty when you talk, talk
I am no angel
I like it when you do that stuff to me
I am no angel
I like it when you talk, talk dirty
When you talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, talk
Dirty talk2
