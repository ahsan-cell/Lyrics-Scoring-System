Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Sleep now, under my skin
Make sure you'll try to
Conjure the wind
And ease my mind

[Refrain]
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You couldn't help out your own neighbour
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fucked up by the blame
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it out and say
Let it pass away

[Verse 2]
Sleep now, under my skin
Make sure you'll try to
Conjure the wind
And ease my mind

[Refrain]
And I said
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, oh, oh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You couldn't help out your own neighbour
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fucked up by the blame
[Post-Chorus]
You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it out and say
You cower in the corner
Confide in your father
Let it break your day
Let it out and say

[Verse 3]
Wait there
Pull yourself out of this state, dear
Acknowledge you were a fake here
From there on, you might just grow

[Chorus]
Somebody call out to your brother
He's calling out your name
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Hiding under the covers
With no one else to blame
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, you couldn't help out your own neighbour
You couldn't tell it to his face
You were fucked up by the blame16
