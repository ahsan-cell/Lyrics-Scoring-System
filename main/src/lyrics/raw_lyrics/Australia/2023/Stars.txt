Face in to creation
Imagination will release your soul as it
Fades out when you're too down
Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
Never be led down a path you don't choose
I'll say it again till I'm turning blue, no, no regrets
Gotta make the moves that feel right for you
Yeah, give it up, give it up

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
It's time to start believing in you, star
Everybody holds you down
Nobody wants your star to flourish too far
Singing it, singing it now
Never pretend you're less than perfect

[Chorus: Ozuna]
Face in to creation
Imagination will release your soul as it
Fades out whеn you're too down
Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt (Oh, oh)

[Verse 2: Bebe Rexha]
Shimmеring golden, dream life all night
Seventeen open doors to insight
Stereo, five times five minds a glow
Thunder cat godlike friend of mine
Don't see the magic design
She's alright, trippin' out cold
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
It's time to start believing in you, star
Everybody holds you down
Nobody wants your star to flourish too far
Singing it, singing it now
Never pretend you're less than perfect

[Chorus: Ozuna & Bebe Rexha, Ozuna]
Face in to creation
Imagination will release your soul as it
Fades out when you're too down
Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt (Oh, oh)

[Verse 3: Ozuna]
Que nadie te diga lo que tú no puede' hacer
Siempre encontramo' la salida a lo que nos puede joder
Vive como si mañana es el último día
Como que ere' la útlima cerveza bien fría
Yo me voy a beber, so quiero

[Chorus: Ozuna & Bebe Rexha, Ozuna]
Face in to creation
Imagination will release your soul as it
Fades out when you're too down
Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt (Soltero)
Face in to creation (Eh, soltero, eh, eh, soltero)
Imagination will release your soul as it (Eh, oh, soltero, soltero)
Fades out when you're too down (Eh, soltero, ah, ah, soltero, jaja)
Getting wasted, lost in worlds of doubt (Soltero, Ozuna)1
