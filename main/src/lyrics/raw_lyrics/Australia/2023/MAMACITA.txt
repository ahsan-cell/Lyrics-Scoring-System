Eh, make me proud, make me proud, yeah
She's out here fuckin' around now
Off that tequila, again (Oh, woah)
She gon' kill me with her mouth, yeah (Oh, yeah)
She makes me dance in the moonlight (Moonlight)
She keeps some white in that pouch (Yeah, yeah)
She makes me sniff 'til the sun's up (Yeah)
She's never lettin' me down (Woo!)

[Chorus]
That's my mamacita, yeah (Mamacita)
I won't ever leave her, yeah (Yeah, yеah)
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
I don't love hеr, but I need her, yeah
That's my mamacita, yeah
Mama-mamacita, yeah
Mama, I might keep her, might keep her
That's my mamacita-macita

[Post-Chorus]
(That's my mamacita, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Listen, she's been creepin' in silence
She keeps the blade, so don't try it (No)
Never been caught by the law (Oh, no)
But that doesn't mean she's not violent (Yuh)
She'll make you burn in the rain
She'll cool you down in the fire
She may not tell you the truth (Oh, yeah)
But that doesn't make her a liar

Kind face with a cruel heart (Cruel heart)
She can do it better than a pornstar, ayy
She don't carry no more Xan bars (Xan)
