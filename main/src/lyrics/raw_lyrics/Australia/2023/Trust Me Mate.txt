You're pulling out your cigarette
You bring it up towards your lips
You breathe and push the smoke away just like you do with all your friends
Your room is messy and full of clothes
The curtains drawn, the windows closed
When did the person that I love turn into someone I don't know?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a light gone from your eyes
Like the whole world's not as bright until you find another high
There's so much pain inside your voice
And you try to drown it out with anything to fill the void

[Chorus]
But, trust me, mate, you've got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promisе that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
Wе almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you

[Verse 2]
I say it's time we have the talk
Make a move towards the door
And you deny there's anything you've got to hide or answer for
You say, "I don't want you in my place"
"Just get the fuck out of my face"
But I won't give up so easy 'cause I know you'd do the same

So, trust me, mate, you've got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promise that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
We almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse

[Bridge]
And, if it gets worse
Before it gets better
Don't be afraid to fall
'Cause I won't let ya
If it gets worse
Before it gets better
Don't be afraid to fall

[Chorus]
So, trust me, mate, you've got this
You always were the strongest
But I'm not gonna promise that this won't hurt
You were lying in the bathroom
We almost thought we lost you
'Cause tryna numb the pain only makes it worse
I'm not giving up on you
[Outro]
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
I'm not giving up on you
