(ILIR808 shit)
And we get money, ain't worried about
(Kuda)
And we tote guns, and let that
And we
Get it
Argh, yeah

[Chorus]
And we get money, ain't worried about hoes
And we tote guns, and let the bitch blow
And we get 'round European mode
You already know, I ain't tryna boast, that's just how it go
And we get money, ain't worried about hoes
And we tote guns, and let the bitch blow
And we get 'round European mode
You already know, I ain't tryna boast, that's just how it go

[Verse 1]
I'm forever drippin'
Hustle all I know so I'm forever flippin'
After I blow, I'm tryna not kiss her
On the paper route like a Dolph, flipper (yeah)
Real hitter (talk to 'em)
You might also like[Verse 2]
See, there ain't no stoppin', now it's in motion (in motion)
These days I'm too booked for all the commotion
Yeah, they see how I'm livin' so they want promotion (nah)
Broski nearly put him in the morgue frozen (boom, boom, boom)
Bullet holes, no one is safe
We done lift that pole and made him relocate
I'm gettin' bankrolls to pull out your face
Yeah, he tried to play gangster, so we had to demonstrate (what else?)

[Verse 3]
And they can't hit the girls we hit
When we send shots, you know we don't miss
We all in, never calling it quits
I might make a opp, baby, mum, do the splits (yeah, ah)

[Chorus]
And we get money, ain't worried about hoes
And we tote guns, and let the bitch blow
And we get 'round European mode
You already know, I ain't tryna boast, that's just how it go

[Verse 4]
From a street hitter to a public figure (uh-huh)
Brand deals, pose for the picture (uh-huh)
Shootouts to shooting liquor
They said, "Just be yourself", so I threw a sixer (six)
See, when I'm on stage, I'm a crowd-pleaser
No lie, I find running through the traps easier
But now, it's like that these girls much easier
If I ain't on the show, means they found cheaper
[Verse 5]
I put a star on my trigger finger, shooting star
I rock a show, I'm a wonder, need a entourage
In a war zone, we train to stay sharp
'Cause we war with anyone, don't care who you are (uh-huh)
The bigger you get, the bigger the target (what else?)
Mark the price, I set the margin (what else?)
Up my price if you try and bargain
You don't have to like me (bitch), I'm paid regardless

[Chorus]
And we get money, ain't worried about hoes
And we tote guns, and let the bitch blow
And we get 'round European mode
You already know, I ain't tryna boast, that's just how it go

[Bridge]
See, when you at the top, yeah, you're the topic
And she know how we rock, so she wanna pop it
If we got that drop, then we gonna pop it
When we up in the store, we ain't window shoppin'

[Outro]
And we get money, ain't worried about hoes
And we tote guns, and let the bitch blow
And we get 'round European mode
You already know, I ain't tryna boast, that's just how it go
