Feels like I'm waiting
Like I'm watching
Watching you for love
Dreams, where I'm fading
Fading

[Chorus]
So free my mind
All the talking
Wasting all your time
I'm giving all
That I've got

[Verse 2]
Feels like I'm dreaming
Like I'm walking
Walking by your side
Keeps on repeating
Repeating

[Chorus]
So free my mind
All the talking
Wasting all your time
I'm giving all
That I've got

If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours

[Outro]
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours
If you want me
If you need me
I'm yours13
