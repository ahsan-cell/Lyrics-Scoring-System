Boys light up, cop me an O, blazing it all
Make that rain, call me James, Australian Crawl
I got packs on a rack and trap 'round the map with an eighth of a ball
Them boys light up, light up, light up yeah, boys light up, light up, light up yeah

[Verse 1]
Legged it, clothes line pegged it
No Schwartzman but I fenced it, exit
Money come down to the pound like Brexit
West bitch wanna come slide, have sex with
On reckless
I'm James Lay when I'm blazin the ball
Sold out packs with the stadium ball
And travelled round the map with Australian Crawl
Sing, Song, Dance but then I popped four man
Fuckin on 1, 2, 3, brother I push 4 grams
You're illiterate, please you're a little bitch
Sweetened the deal, AC let me riddle it
Fly to Milan like man's IbrahimoviÄ‡
50 Cent, I get paid for a little bit

[Hook]
Boys light up, cop me an O, blazing it all
Make that rain, call me James, Australian Crawl
I got packs on a rack and trap 'round the map with an eighth of a ball
Them boys light up, light up, light up yeah, boys light up, light up, light up yeah
Boys light up, cop me an O, blazing it all
Make that rain, call me James, Australian Crawl
I got packs on a rack and trap 'round the map with an eighth of a ball
Them boys light up, light up, light up yeah, boys light up, light up, light up yeah

Get spun full cycle, laundry
Old school rooster, Adrian Morley
6 in the morning with grams of the ganja
Land down under, blazin' 'til I'm yawnin'
Cause I'm Blake, not Drake, but I still want money like Aubrey
Still got plans and I keep my views
No Tom let's Cruise, tell her man don't taunt me
Casper haunt me
Tell 'em fuck ya number, don't call me
Wifey at home when my life went rogue
With her son back home cause the hoes just bore me
No glory, like a insta ban your man got no story
Forget ya shit man, spit like dory
I can hear the good kush calling

[Hook]
Boys light up, cop me an O, blazing it all
