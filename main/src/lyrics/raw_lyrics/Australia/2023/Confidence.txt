It's all about confidence, baby
And she was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'll probably hate me

[Bridge]
Well, I should've said this, and I should've said that
But all that I know now

[Chorus]
It's all about confidence, baby
And she was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'll probably hate me

[Post-Chorus]
Well, I think she knows, well, I think she knows
She's making me nervous, she's making me nervous
I think she knows, well, I think she knows
That she's out of my league

[Chorus]
'Cause it's all about confidence, baby
And she was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'll probably hate me

Well, I should've said this, and I should've said that
But all that I know now

[Chorus]
It's all about confidence, baby
And she was a confident lady
And I know she's driving me crazy
And after all this, I know she'll probably hate me

[Post-Chorus]
Well, I think she knows, well, I think she knows
She's making me nervous, she's making me nervous
Well, I think she knows, well, I think she knows
That she's out of my league7
