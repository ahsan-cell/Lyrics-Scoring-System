I'm moving through the night
My soul’s just a container
I can't tell you what I'll write
They’re words without the paper
Take my ego for a drive
Leave it out at the 110 sign
In the kitchen after five
In the hallway before nine

[Chorus]
And if it wasn't for that time in the taxi
When you called it out, you said it was anxiety
Well, you held me from the back of the front seat
And you told me all the times that you'd lied to me
Well, I felt like a kid, like I could touch my feet
As they hovered above the ground in my booster seat
Oh-oh-oh
Well, it feels like that again

[Verse 2]
Drink a jug of mind eraser
Feel it burn and watch it glow
All my friends on a retainer
And I'm almost out of dough
You might also like[Chorus]
And if it wasn't for that time in the taxi
When you called it out, you said it was anxiety
Well, you held me from the back of the front seat
And you told me all the times that you'd lied to me
Well, I felt like a kid, like I could touch my feet
As they hovered above the ground in my booster seat
Oh-oh-oh
Well, it feels like that again

[Bridge]
Oh, I'm waiting for it patiently
My unmarked grave, my salty sea
In my pants too short, in my shame up to my knees
In a wave of guilt I roll and in a hurricane I breathe
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
And if it wasn't for that time in the taxi
When you called it out, you said it was anxiety
Well, you held me from the back of the front seat
And you told me all the times that you’d lied to me
Well, I felt like a kid, like I could touch my feet
As they hovered above the ground in my booster seat
Oh-oh-oh
Well, it feels like that again6
