Op Shop Lover

[Verse 1: grentperez]
Woah, you're so careless
You're teaching me to careless
And leaving me so breathless
With your style and stick awareness
Fools love pretending
We're richer than we are
Clothes from old grandpa's

[Pre-Chorus: grentperez]
And fools loves pretending
We're richer than we are
Still pray that my car starts

[Chorus: grentperez]
So, how did I get so lucky?
Hand in hand, in second-hand stuff
Ooh, you look so lovely
You're my diamante in the rough
And you're never fussy
Love that you love doin' nothing
Let's try on another
My Op Shop Lover, ooh
You might also like[Verse 2: Lime Cordiale]
Scoured every store within this
Town filled with funny business
You put me in those dresses
Laugh at me in public places (Haha)
Life in present tense
Sleeping in the car
The back of your Toyota
Livin' life in present tense
Sittin' on a fence
Wonderin' how it ends?

[Chorus: grentperez & Lime Cordiale]
How did I get so lucky?
Hand in hand, with second-hand stuff
Ooh, you look so lovely
You're my diamante in the rough
And you're never fussy
Love that you love doin' nothing
Let's try on another
My Op Shop Lover

[Bridge: grentperez]
That's actually you know
(Haha)
That's actually you know
I love that shit, I love it
[Pre-Chorus: grentperez]
Fools loves pretending
We're richer than we are (Richer baby)
Fools loves pretending
We're richer than we are (Richer baby)

[Chorus: grentperez & Lime Cordiale]
How did I get so lucky?
Hand in hand, in second-hand stuff
Ooh, you look so lovely
You're my diamante in the rough
And you're never fussy
Love that you love doin' nothing
Let's try on another
