I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away

[Verse 1]
I've been on my own for a minute
Is it only me out here?
Searching for the place to begin it
Is it me? Is it you? Is it fear?
Standing on the line I was given
People staring at me while I'm here
No one seems to think that I fit in
But I don't wanna be like them

[Pre-Chorus]
No, 'cause I don't wanna be like them
'Cause I know that I, know that I

[Chorus]
I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
(Fly away, fly away)
Woah, woah, I'd fly away

No one knew how low I was feeling
I was scared to reach for it all
Knowing I was herе for a reason
But I was scared that if I tried, I'd fall
So whеre do I go now that I'm in it?
I never thought it'd be like this
Dreaming all my life and I did it
Thought the grass is greener than it is

[Chorus]
'Cause I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh
Woah, oh (Fly away, fly away)
Oh, I'd fly away, woah, woah, oh (Fly away, fly away)
I'd fly away

[Bridge]
'Cause  I had a dream that someday
I would just fly, fly away
And I always knew I couldn't stay
So I had a dream that I'd just fly away, away, oh

[Chorus]
Woah, woah
(Fly away, fly away)
(Fly away, fly away)
Woah, woah, woah
(Fly away, fly away)
(Fly away)
I'd fly away7
