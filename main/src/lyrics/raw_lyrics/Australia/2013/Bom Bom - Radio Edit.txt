I'm the cat with bass and drum, going 'round like bom bom bom!
What's grooving? I'm moving, I like your style of womping!
How charming! Just a rapper, load him up and eat that snapper!
I want sixteen pints of rum and then I go bom bom!
Glowing up in the dark in the night and so I go ooh ah ah ah ah, I
I've brought a pie in my pocket, pie in my pocket, an eye in my socket
No got life, no got style, no got nothing on my mind
But I'm so cool, and I'm so groovy, when I go bom bom bom!

Going around like bom bom bom!

I'm so cool, and I'm so groovy, when I go bom bom bom!
