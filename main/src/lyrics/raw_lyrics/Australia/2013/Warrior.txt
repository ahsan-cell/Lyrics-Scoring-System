I am a fighter, it’s in my DNA
Step by step, and brick by brick, nobody stoppin' me
Quit tryin' to shoot me down, ’cause I’m invincible
I think you made a mistake, I am warrior

[Pre-Chorus]
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
March like a champion

[Chorus]
I’m gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel my blood running wild and young
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior
Warrior
Warrior
Warrior
Warrior

[Verse 2]
I am a blizzard, eh-eh, so don’t get in my way
I keep on blowin' ’til there’s nothing left in front of me
You wanna take my crown, but I’m invincible
You are a venomous snake, but I’m a warrior

I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Punch like a champion

I’m gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel my blood running wild and young
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior
Warrior
Warrior
Warrior

[Bridge]
People can say what they wanna say
When I’m in the ring, baby, I’m heavyweight
I’m not gonna run when I hear the call, hear the call

[Pre-Chorus]
I stand like a soldier, yeah
Strike like a tiger
I stand like a soldier, yeah
March like a champion
[Chorus]
I’m gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Gonna feel my blood running wild and young
Gonna dance, dance, dance to the beat of my drum
Like a warrior
