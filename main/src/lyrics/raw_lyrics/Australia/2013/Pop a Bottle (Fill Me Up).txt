Day and night, day and night
You're on my mind, on my mind
It's only you and I, you and I
Just you and me, yeah, uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Got me drunk on your love
So where's the after party?
'Cause I'm just getting started
(Hey, hey, hey)
Keep on pouring it up
And don't you ever stop it
I know you know I want it

[Chorus]
But I don't wanna wait till the weekend comes
Just so I can pop a bottle of your love
Take another shot, I'll never get enough
Come on and fill me up, fill me u-u-u-u-up
I don't wanna wait till the weekend comes
Just so I can pop a bottle of your love
Take another shot, I'll never get enough
Come on and fill me up, fill me u-u-u-u-u-up

[Post-Chorus]
Up, up, oh up, oh up
Fill me (Up up)
Up, up, oh up, oh up
Fill me (Up up)
Up, up, oh up, oh up
Fill me
Come on and fill me up, fill me u-u-u-up

Don't wanna leave the party

I know you know I want it
