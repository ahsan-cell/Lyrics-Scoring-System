I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days, I'm stronger now
Or so I say, but something's missing

Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me
Through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now, I just can't figure it out
What now, I guess
I'll just wait it out, wait it out
What now, what now

I found the one, he changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love but I'm numb again

Whatever it is, it feels like it's laughing at me
Through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is, it's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream

What now, I just can't figure it out
What now, I guess
I'll just wait it out, wait it out
What now, please tell me, what now
You might also likeThere's no one to call
'Cause I'm just playing games with them all
The more I swear I'm happy
The more that I'm feeling alone

'Cause I spend every hour
Just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone but I just wanna shout

What now, I just can't figure it out
What now, I guess
I'll just wait it out wait it out
What now, somebody tell me, what now

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh, oh why

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh, oh why

I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh, oh why, so what now
