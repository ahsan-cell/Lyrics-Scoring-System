[Verse 1: Tom Fletcher]
Today
I'm laughing the clouds away
I hear what the flowers say
And drink every drop of rain
And I see
Places that I have been
In ways that I've never seen
My side of the grass is green

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Fletcher]
Ooh I can't believe that it's so simple
It feels so natural to me

[Chorus: Danny Jones]
If this is love
Then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love
Then love completes me
Cause it feels like I've been missing you
A simple equation
With no complications
To leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
It's the easiest thing to do

[Verse 2: Tom Fletcher]
Feel the way that I do?
Do I turn your grey skies blue?
And make dirty streets look new?
Hmm and the birds sing
Tweeheeheeheeheeheeheet
Tweedleedeedeedee
Now I know exactly what they mean

[Pre-Chorus: Tom Fletcher]
Ooh I can't believe that it's so simple
It feels so natural to me

[Chorus: Danny Jones]
If this is love
Then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love
Then love completes me
Cause it feels like I've been missing you

[Bridge]
What is it you want, Mary?
What do you want?
You want the moon?
Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down
Hey, that's a pretty good idea
I'll give you the moon, Mary

[Chorus: Tom Fletcher]
If this is love
Then love is easy
It's the easiest thing to do
If this is love
Then love completes me
Cause it feels like I've been missing you
A simple equation
With no complications
To leave you confused
If this is love, love, love
It's the easiest thing to do
