Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face (Whoa-oh-oh)
There's no one quite like you
You push all my buttons down
I know life would suck without you (Whoa-oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You're an asshole, but I love you
And you make me so mad, I ask myself (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
And no one else can break my heart like you

[Post-Chorus: P!nk]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh

Just once, try to wrap your little brain around my feelings
Just once, please try not to be so mean (Whoa-oh-oh)
Repeat after me now R-O-M-A-N-C-E-E-E
Come on, I'll say it slowly (Romance)
You can do it, babe

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
At the same time, I wanna hug you
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
You're an asshole, but I love you
And you make me so mad I ask myself (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
Why I'm still here, or where could I go
You're the only love I've ever known (Hey, hey, hey, hey)
But I hate you, I really hate you
So much, I think it must be

[Chorus: P!nk]
True love, true love
It must be true love
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love, true love
It must be true love
And no one else can break my heart like you

[Post-Chorus: P!nk]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh
[Interlude: P!nk]
I think it must be love (I love you)
I think it must be love (I love you)

[Bridge: Lily Allen]
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?
Why do you say the things that you say?
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be
But without you, I'm incomplete

[Chorus: P!nk]
Oh, I think it must be
True love (It must be), true love
It must be true love (It must be)
Nothing else can break my heart like
True love (It must be), true love
It must be true love (It must be)
And no one else can break my heart like you (Like you)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh
No one else can break my heart like you (Like you)
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yo-oh-oh-oh
No one else can break my heart like you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)10
