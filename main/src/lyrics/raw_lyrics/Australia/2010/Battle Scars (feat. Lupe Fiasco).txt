Hope the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
(Uh)
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wound me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shootin' spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're tryin' to beat the odds up
Been tryin' to keep your nods up and you know that you should know (You know)
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
(Go) With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover, not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Tryin' to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much (Much)
'Cause I'm the only one that's tryna keep us together (Yeah)
When all of the signs say that I should forget her (Uh-huh)
I wish you weren't the best (Best), the best I ever had (Had)
I wish that the good outweighed the bad (Yeah)
'Cause it'll never be over (It'll never be over)
Until you tell me it's over (Until you tell me it's over, yeah)

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(Then just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground, screaming, "Medic"
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors, and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win
[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much (So much)
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together (Yeah)
When all of the signs say that I should forget her (Yeah)
I wish you weren't the best (Best), the best I ever had (Had)
I wish that the good outweighed the bad (Uh-huh)
'Cause it'll never be over (Can never be over)
Until you tell me it's over (Until you tell me it's over)

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Bridge: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
'Cause you've set me on fire (Fire)
I've never felt so alive, yeah
No, hoping wounds heal, but it never does
That's because you're at war with love (Oh)
And I'm at the point of breaking (Uh-huh)
And it's impossible to shake it (Yeah), oh
[Pre-Chorus: Lupe Fiasco & Guy Sebastian]
See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love (Oh)
Hope it heals, but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
These battle scars don't look like they're fading (Yeah)
Don't look like they're ever going away (Uh-huh)
(Never) I ain't ever gonna change (Never)
These battle scars don't look like they're fading (Yeah; uh-huh)
Don't look like they're ever going away (Never)
They ain't never gonna change (Never)
These battle scars don't look like they're fading (Uh-huh)
Don't look like they're ever going away (Battle)
I ain't ever gonna change
