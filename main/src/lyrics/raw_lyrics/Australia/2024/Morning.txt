HENRY: Go buy yourself a coat.

[KAREN shivers with excitement.]

[CAMERA DOLLIES into tree.]

HENRY: Lufthansa should have been our ultimate score. The heist of a
lifetime. Six million in cash. More than enough to go around.

CUT TO: STACKS Bending over to put on his shoes. We hear water in the
sink.

CUT TO: TOMMY pulling out a .38 caliber gun with a silencer from
his belt.

HENRY *V.O.*: Stacks was always crazy. Instead of getting rid of the truck like he was supposed to, he got stoned, went to his girlfriend's and by the time he woke up, the cops had found the truck. It was all over the television. They even said they came up with prints off the wheel. It was just a matter of tine before they got to Stacks.

JIMMY *smiling*: So what?  Where are they gonna go?

CUT TO: A SMILING TOMMY entering the men's room.

JIMMY *to Tommy and barely able to suppress his glee*: He's worried.

TOMMY *suddenly hugging Henry with happiness and affection*: Come on. Don't worry so fucking much. Things are beautiful. *to Jimmy* Didn't you tell him?

JIMMY *wreathed in smiles*: Not yet.

[HENRY gently breaks away from TOMMY'S hug. Stares at JIMMY.]

JIMMY: Tommy's gonna be made.

[HENRY is momentarily impressed.]

HENRY *incredulous*: Paulie's gonna make him?

JIMMY *proudly grabbing Tommy's beaming face in his hands and kissing him*: Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.

MARTY *annoyed and pleading with Henry as Jimmy and Tommy hurry past*: Hey! Come on, already. If it wasn't for me, none of you would have had anything.

[WE SEE HENRY grab MARTY and shove him in the men's room and close the door.]

HENRY *angry*: Will you shut your fucking mouth. You're gonna get your money, just stop busting balls. Okay? Relax. You hear? Everything's gonna be fine.

[WE SEE HENRY slam the bathroom door on MARTY and hurry back to the bar.]

[EXT. ROBERT'S LOUNGE - NIGHT]

[WE SEE JIMMY and TOMMY leaving the bar after a long night. WE SEE MARTY outside waiting for them.]

JIMMY *bursts out laughing*: Son of a bitch. You're a pisser.

[WE SEE MARTY begin to laugh, too. WE SEE JIMMY hug MARTY around the shoulder affectionately as they walk away from the bar.]

JIMMY: You wanna talk? Okay, come on, let's get it over with. I swear
I've never known a ball buster like you in all my life.

MARTY *all smiles*: Ah, but Jimmy, nobody loves you. like I do. You know that. You name it.  I'll do anything for you.

JIMMY *still laughing*: Except to stop busting my balls.

[We hear tires squeal and two shots ring out.]

CUT TO: INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

[We hear a doorbell, waking HENRY and KAREN from sleep.]

WOMAN *O.S.*: Open up.  Henry! Karen! It's me. Fran!

[WE SEE HENRY and RARER open the door and HE SEE FRAN KRUGMAN standing there in her housecoat, and distraught.]

FRAN *hysterical*: Marty didn't come home. He's missing. I know something happened to him.

HENRY: Wait a minute.  Calm down.

KAREN: Fran. It'll be okay. Don't worry.

FRAN: I know something happened.

HENRY: What could happen? He got drunk. He passed out somewhere. I'll go looking for him in the morning.

FRAN: In twenty years he's never been away all night without calling. I know something's wrong.

HENRY: Awright, awright. Let me take you home and I'll go look for him myself. Right now.

[EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE SHERWOOD DINER - DAWN]

[HENRY and JIMMY are leaving together.]

HENRY: What'll I tell Fran?

JIMMY: Who gives a fuck? Tall her he ran away with a broad. What do you care about her.

[Suddenly JIMMY spots TWO FBI MEN who had been tailing him, dozing in their unmarked car. Be starts toward their car.]

JIMMY: Watch this.

HENRY: Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?

JIMMY: I do it all the time. Bust their fucking balls.

HENRY: Jimmy, come on. Fuck 'em. Don't give them the satisfaction.

[HENRY watches JIMMY tiptoe up to the AGENTS' car and rap on the window. The startled AGENTS look up and see JIMMY staring at them.]

JIMMY: Come on, fuckoes. Let's go for a ride. *to Henry as Jimmy starts his car* I keep 'em up all fuckin' night.

[While HENRY walks to his own car, WE SEE JIMMY roar off and we hear the squeal of tires and brakes as JIMMY and still sleepy AGENTS in pursuit speed away from the club.]

[EXT. CAFORA'S PINK CADILLAC PARKED ON BROOKLYN STREET NEAR SCHOOL BUS STOP - MORNING]

[WE SEE SOME YOUNGSTERS walk over to peek in the car. The YOUNGSTERS are giggling. ONE BOY sneaks up alongside the ear door and peeks inside. We hear a yell.]

[WE SEE the bodies of FAT LOUIE CAFORA and his wife, DOLORES, slumped against each other on the front seat. Blood has caked all over their faces from small bullet holes in their beads.]

[EXT. LARGE DUMPSTER BEHIND DINER NEAR AIRPORT - DAWN]

[WE SEE large garbage truck back up to the dumpster as GARBAGE MAN lashes two steel cables to rings on top of dumpster.]

[WE SEE GARBAGE MAN signal for SO to tighten cable and tip dumpster into truck.]

[CLOSE UP OF TOP OF DUMPSTER as it is tipped over and WE SEE an arm fall over the side and as dumpster tips more WE SEE another arm and the dead faces of FRENCHY McMAHON and JOE BUDDHA as GARBAGE MAN screams to helper SO to stop.]

[EXT. HOSTS POINT MARKET - TRUCK PARKING LOT - MORNING]

[WE SEE the open door of a large refrigeration truck. WE SEE bright lights and flashbulbs go off.]

[CAMERA STEADILY MOVES IN ON frozen body hanging from a rack inside the truck.]

HENRY *V.O.*: Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery, but it had nothing to do with me. I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money. From then on I kept my mouth shut.  I knew Jimmy. He had the cash.  It was his. I know he kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it.  It made him sick to have to turn money over to the guys who stole it. He'd rather whack them. Anyway, what did I care? I wasn't. asking for anything and, besides. Jimmy was making nice money with me through my Pittsburgh connections. But still, for months after the robbery, they were finding bodies all over.

[CAMERA MOVES ONTO CLOSE UP - ANGELO SEPE'S FROZEN FACE]

HENRY *V.O.*: When they found Sepe in the meat truck, he was frozen so stiff it took them two days to thaw him out for the autopsy.

[INT. SHERWOOD DINER - DAY]

[A bright sunny afternoon, HENRY and JIMMY seated in a window booth.  WE SEE JIMMY eating eggs on pancakes with sausages and toasted English muffins.]

HENRY *V.O.*: Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy. He was like a kid. We had money coming in through my Pittsburgh people and after a while even the Lufthansa thing began to calm  down.But the thing that made Jimmy so happy that morning was that this was the day Tommy was being made.

[EXT. TOMMY DESIMONE'S MOTHER'S HOUSE - MORNING]

[WE SEE TOMMY is all dressed. He kisses his MOTHER. TOMMY walks down the stairs toward TWO WISEGUYS and into a waiting car.]

HENRY *V.O.*: Jimmy was so excited, you'd think he was being made. He must have made four calls to Tommy's house. They had a signal all set up so he'd know the minute the ceremony. was over.-

[INT. SHERWOOD DINER - DAY]

[JIMMY has finished his breakfast and spots HENRY's untouched melon.]

JIMMY *looking at watch*: You want the melon?

HENRY: Nah.

JIMMY *reaches for the melon and looks at his watch*: I better call again.

HENRY *V.O.*: Jimmy and I could never be made, because we bad Irish blood. It didn't even matter that my mother was Sicilian. To become a member of a crew, you've got to be one hundred percent Italian So that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.

[INT. ONE-FAMILY BRIOC BUILDING WITH GARAGE UNDER THE FIRST FLOOR]

[WE SEE the car pull into basement garage and door close.]

[INT. SHERWOOD DINER - HENRY'S POV]

[From HENRY'S POV in window, WE SEE JIMMY cross the parking lot to an outdoor phone booth on the side of the road. Trades are roaring past.]

HENRY *V.O.*: It's the highest honor they can give you. It means you belong to a family and a crew. It means that nobody can fuck around with you. It also means you can fuck around with anybody, as long as they aren't also a member. It's like a license to steal.

[INT. BASEMENT ROOM OFF THE GARAGE as TOMMY proudly walks into the room, followed by the TWO WISEGUYS.]

HENRY *V.O.*: As far as Jimmy was concerned, with Tommy being made, it was like we were all being made. We would now have one of our own guys as a member.

[TOMMY proudly walks into the room. WE SEE a HOOD suddenly appear behind him, put a gun to his head and fire. WE SEE TOMMY inertly drop to the ground in a heap.]

HENRY *V.O.*: Except, they didn't make Tommy that day.

CUT TO: JIMMY - IN PHONE BOOTH

[Suddenly, JIMMY slams down the phone with so much strength that the booth shudders.]

HENRY *V.O.*: They killed him. It was revenge for Billy Batts.

[When JIMMY turns around, WE SEE that he is crying. WE SEE HENRY hurrying toward JIMMY to console him.]

HENRY *V.O.*: And there was nothing we could do. Batts was a made man and Tommy wasn't. We had to sit still and take it. It was among the Italians. It was real greaseball shit. They even shot Tommy in the face so his mother couldn't give him an open coffin at the funeral.

CLOSE UP ON DATE - SUNDAY, JANUARY 11, 1979.
