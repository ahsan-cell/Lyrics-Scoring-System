I want you to know
It's time to go
Yeah, we are done
I want you to see
That I need (Oh) to be free

[Pre-Refrain]
(Done, done, done, done, done, done)
We are done
(Done, done, done, done, done, done)
We are—

[Refrain]
Done with being the silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No, we won't just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done

[Verse 2]
You, first brought the sun
For everyone, uh here to see
Why does it always change
To guns and chains, eventually?

(Done, done, done, done, done, done)
We are done
(Done, done, done, done, done, done)
We are—

[Refrain]
Done with being the silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No, we won't just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done
Done with being the silent many
Every voice rings out and carries
No, we won't just go back
Home without you hearing
The sound when the many say
We are done8
