At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don’t
So I’m glad that I’m here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying you’re not alone
Singing la la la la
Que sera

[Verse 1]
(Here we go, yo)
Yesterday is history (oh)
You gotta get through it
Tomorrow is a mystery
So let’s just do it

And even when the rain falls
You and I will stand tall
No matter what you go through
I’ll never leave you

[Bridge]
So you gotta be strong (strong)
Live by the words of the song (song)
Together is where we belong (long)
Never stop dreaming
Keep holding on
You might also like[Chorus]
At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don’t
So I’m glad that I’m here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying you’re not alone
Singing la la la la
Que sera

[Verse 2]
When it’s been a long day
Had enough, given up, it ain’t okay
We don’t care what the world say
We spread love it’s the only way

[Bridge]
So you gotta be strong (strong)
Live by the words of the song (song)
Together is where we belong (long)
Never stop dreaming
Keep holding on

[Chorus]
At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don’t
So I’m glad that I’m here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying you’re not alone
Singing la la la la
Que sera
[Verse 3]
We keep falling
But the world keeps spinning
And I might stop winning
Just as long as I got you by my side
We keep falling
But the world keeps spinning
And I might stop winning
But I know that we’re gonna be alright

[Chorus x4]
At the end of the day
Some you win, some you don’t
So I’m glad that I’m here
With some friends that I know
Always there with a smile
Saying you’re not alone
Singing la la la la
Que sera4
