Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let's stop running from love, running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us, running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now let's stop running from love, running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us, running from us
Let's stop, my baby
