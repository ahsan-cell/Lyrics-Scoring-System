When I'm in town (Yeah), party's goin' down (You dig? It's goin' down), uh
Shoot 'em down (Baow) with a fifty round (You dig? A fifty round), ayy
Run the town (What?), ballin' hard, you outta bounds, you dig? (Swish) Uh, ayy

Walk in that bitch and I'm faded, uh
I fuck that bitch when I'm faded
I got the M&M's (Millions), I called my mom, told her, "I made it"
Yeah, mama, your son too famous (Yeah), he on everybody playlist
But he's still armed and dangerous, he'll pop at a stranger
Sippin' lean, clich√©, I still do it anyway
Red or purple in a cup, which one shall I pick today? Ayy, ayy
Sippin' 'Hardt, gun on me, no need for bodyguard
Aim at your body parts, yeah
Take off your body parts, yeah
I'm swingin' when I'm off the ecstasy (Uh), that's a Molly park, yeah
Iron on me, hoo-hoo, that's a Tony Stark, yeah
Pourin' fours in a twenty ounce soda pop, yeah
I'm O.C, three-gram 'Wood full of OG (Huh)
Give BM dick like Moby (Uh), gun make him flash, Adobe, uh
Pay up that cash, you owe me, yeah, huh, bitch, I need it
Matter fact, fuck that shit, I'm rich, uh, you can keep it
Yeah (Bitch, woo, yeah), damn
Rich niggas over here (They over, huh, here), yeah
