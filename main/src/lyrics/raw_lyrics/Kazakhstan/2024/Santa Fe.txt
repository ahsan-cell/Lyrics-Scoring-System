Your days in one
This day undone
(The kind that breaks under)
All day at once
(For me, for you)
I'm just too young
(And what of my heart)

[Verse 2]
This day was once
(Silently full)
Of grace, of lost
Can't wait at all
(Can't wait at all)
Temptation won

[Pre-Chorus]
And whatever comes through the door
You see her face to face
All about your place

[Chorus]
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
Sign me up Santa Fe
On the cross Santa Fe
And all I want
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
You might also likeAnd I and I and I alone want you to know
And I and I and I alone
And I and I and I alone want you to know
And I and I and I alone

[Verse 3]
Your days in one
This day undone
(The kind that breaks under)
All day at once
(For me, for you)
I'm just too young
(And what of my heart)

[Chorus]
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son
Sign me up Santa Fe
On the cross Santa Fe
And all I want
Sign me up Santa Fe
And call your son3
