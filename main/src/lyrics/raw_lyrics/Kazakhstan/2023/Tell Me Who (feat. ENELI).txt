The world gets lonely
Find me something to believe in
Maybe I’m blind
The world’s gone mad now
Find me something to believe in
Maybe I’m blind

[Pre-Chorus]
See I’ve been waiting for so long
Waitin’ for so long
See I’ve been waiting for so long
Why does it always seem so wrong
Ooo, it seems so wrong
See I’ve been waiting for so long

[Chorus]
Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do is gonna come back to you
Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do what you do

[Verse 2]
This ain’t the truth I wanna find
Or am I dreaming
Maybe I’m blind
This ain’t the place I said
I always wanna live in
Maybe I’m blind

See I’ve been waiting for so long
Waitin’ for so long
See I’ve been waiting for so long
Why does it always seem so wrong
Ooo, it seems so wrong
See I’ve been waiting for so long

[Chorus]
Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do is gonna come back to you
Tell me who is gonna be there for you
What you do what you do

[Bridge]
I think I might lose it
I’m so tired of usin’
Just different words
To say the same story
But I guess I’m just lonely
What can you do for me
Will you just let me be
Have I done anything wrong

[Outro]
Tell me who…
Just tell me who…
Tell me who…
Just tell me who…
Just tell me who…1
