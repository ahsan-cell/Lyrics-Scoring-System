I remember the days when we were just kids
I wish that we could go back to those days
I remember the days we were kids. Yeah

[Verse 1]
I remember, the days when we were
Just kids but no more is that how we live
Nothing to ignore, never overthinking
Just floating ashore, but now were sinking
How..
Did the time go by so fast?
I wish we could just go back
Back to the days when we were young
Not a worry in the world just having fun
Not thinking bout the days to come
Only right now we just wanna run

[Bridge]
I just wanna go back
I just wanna go back
I just wanna go back
I just wanna go back, back, back

[Hook]
I just wanna go back to the days when we were just kids
Go back to the days when we were just kids
Go back to the days when we were just kids
Go back to the days when we were just kids

Ohhh, what went wrong, I thought we had it all?
As we grew up I watched our innocence fall down
And now I'm just staring at the wall
Wishing that I could go back, I could go back right now

[Verse 3]
I wish we could go back to the old days
No work, no job, nothing to do but play
Taking our time just going at our own pace
But now were living life like it's a race
Now we don't get looked at the same way
Told we got to get a job and go get paid
But I don't really wanna do that
I just wanna go back

[Hook]
I just wanna go back to the days when we were just kids
Go back to the days when we were just kids
Go back to the days when we were just kids
Go back to the days when we were just kids1
