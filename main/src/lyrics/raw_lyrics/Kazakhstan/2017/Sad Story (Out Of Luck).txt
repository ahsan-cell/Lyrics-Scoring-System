A sad story, might find it boring
Lost his mum to a drug named Heroin
Father's gone, so grandma's left with everything
Two grandkids and a daughter's coffin
I never really knew him when he was growing up
But I assumed that it was a little fucked
No parents for him to look up to
Just a brother whom I knew was a dodgy fuck
Shit, I used to think he was a dick
Tried too hard to fit
And never grow out of it

[Chorus]
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

[Verse 2]
Never left his home town
That's what probably did it
Never saw the other worlds
That he didn't want to go and get it
Occupied by fitting in where minds are small
Where small things make the small kings feel so tall
Will he ever change?
Well apparently
He reapplied for college and was waiting for his grades
It wouldn't help his case
Oh, I couldn't ever say
[Chorus]
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

[Verse 3]
But wait my life's out, a night out
Brother's in town, sending doubt, a few fights now
Kicked out clubs, shit, the suns up
One looks all it took for his girl to cuss at another
Dudes being dudes
They blow at the chest to impress these breasts
That'd just started this mess
They must protect the damsel in distress
So other girl's man decides to clench his fist
And then he threw and missed
Brother's hit, as did his, dropped him quick
Then one kick to the head
Oh shit, other man is dead

[Chorus]
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
[Bridge]
And now he's locked away
21 years of age
How many lives will go to waste?
As far as graves until I see some fucking change
Oh, and I don't even know how
We continue to fight one another now

[Chorus]
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck

[Outro]
Now he don't talk too much, talk too much
He's probably given up, given up
I think he's had enough, had enough
Cause he ran out of luck, out of luck11
