When I was lost I felt alone
You gave me light and guide me right
Through the night to where the wind blows
Years had passed by, I'm lonely low
There's only one place that I am sure
Can fix my brokenhearted soul

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's called home
I'm going home

[Chorus]
I've been away for such a long time
I'm on my way, just hope that I'm safe in sound
It's in my mind, home sweet home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

[Verse 2]
Day by day, oh you see me grow
I fight the pain, stand up again
And tried everything to let go

[Pre-Chorus]
Just to go home
I wanna go home, home
You might also like[Chorus]
I've been away for such a long time
I'm on my way, just hope that I'm safe in sound
It's in my mind, home sweet home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home

[Bridge]
I'm doing fine (I'm doing fine)
Staying in line (staying in line)
The sun's going down
And I'm still high
Going up and down the hills
With just my ride
Oh, I'm free
And I can't describe

(Oh, oh, oo oh, oh, oh, oo oh)

[Chorus]
I've been away for such a long time
I'm on my way, just hope that I'm safe in sound
It's in my mind, home sweet home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home (I'm coming home)

[Chorus]
I've been away for such a long time
I'm on my way, just hope that I'm safe in sound
It's in my mind, home sweet home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
[Outro]
I've been away for such a long time
I'm on my way, just hope that I'm safe in sound
It's in my mind, home sweet home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home1
