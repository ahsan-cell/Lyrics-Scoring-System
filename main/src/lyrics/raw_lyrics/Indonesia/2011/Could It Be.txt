Kau datang dan jantungku berdegup kencang
Kau buatku terbang melayang
Tiada ku sangka getaran ini ada
Saat jumpa yang pertama
Mataku tak dapat terlepas darimu
Perhatikan setiap tingkahmu
Tertawa pada setiap candamu
Saat jumpa yang pertama

Could it be love, could it be love
Could it be, could it be, could it be love
Could it be love, could it be love
Could this be something that I never had
Could it be love

Mataku tak dapat terlepas darimu
Perhatikan setiap tingkahmu
Tertawa pada setiap candamu
Saat jumpa yang pertama

Could it be love, could it be love
Could it be, could it be, could it be love
Could it be love, could it be love
Could this be something that I never had
Could it be love

Could it be love, could it be love
Could it be, could it be, could it be love
Could it be love, could it be love
Could this be something that I never had
Could it be love
