I've been so busy, ignoring, and hiding
About what my heart actually say
Stay awake while I’m drowning on my thoughts
Sometimes a happiness is just a happiness

[Pre-Chorus]
I've never been enjoyin' my serenity
Even if I’ve got a lot of company
That makes me happy

[Chorus]
Soul try to figure it out
From where I've been escapin'
Running to end all the sin
Get away from the pressure

Wondering to get a love that is so pure
Gotta have to always make sure
That I'm not just somebody's pleasure

[Verse 2]
I always pretending and lying
Like I'm usеd to feel empty
'Cause all I got is unhappy
Happiness, can't I gеt happiness?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve never been enjoyin’ my serenity
Even if I've got a lot of company
That makes me happy

[Chorus]
Soul try to figure it out
From where I’ve been escapin'
Running to end all the sin
Get away from the pressure

Wondering to get a love that is so pure
Gotta have to always make sure
That I'm not just somebody's pleasure, oh-ho-oo

[Bridge]
It was in a blink of an eye
Find a way how to say goodbye

I’ve got to take me away
From all sadness
Stitch all my wounds, confess all the sins
And took all my insecure

When will I got the love that is so pure?
Gotta have to always make sure
That I'm not just somebody's pleasure
[Outro]
Gotta have
Gotta have to always make sure
That I'm not just somebody's pleasure
