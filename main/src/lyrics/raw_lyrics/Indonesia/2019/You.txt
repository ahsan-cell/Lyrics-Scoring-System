You did hurt my heart
I don't know how many times

Oh you... I don't know what to say
You've made me so desperately in love
And now you let me down

You said you'd never lie again
You said this time would be so right
But then I found you were lying there by her side

Ooh you... You turn my whole life so blue
Drowning me so deep, I just can reach myself again
Ooh you... Successfully tore myheart
Now it's only pieces
Oh nothing left but pieces of you
Oohh oh baby

Ooh you frustated me with this love
I've been trying to understand
You know I'm trying I'm trying

Oh you... I don't know what to say
You've made me so desperately in love
And now you let me down
