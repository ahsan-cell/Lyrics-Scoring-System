Get rich as fuck or die broke, it's not a hard choice
Even though success is such a lonely and a long road
I could be fucked up today but the tables gon' turn tomorrow
One thing 'bout me no matter what, I'ma fill my torso (Yah-yah)
I came a long way (Yah-yah) and I know how far I'll go (Let's go)
To see my family straight I'll move the Kilimanjaro (Let's go)
I'ma make this earth my heaven in case that's not where we all go (Yah-yah)
I'ma make this earth my heaven in case that's not where we all go

[Verse 1: Nasty C]
I'm not a stranger to failure but really I think I'm related to Ws
Consistent as fuck, was born to be up
I can't see this shit from another view
You can call me what you want, I come from the bottom
That slander ain't nothin' new
It's ironic I got 'em pissed off 'cause I'm number one shittin' on number two
Humble as fuck, I don't play with my blessings or life 'cause I know it can humble you
People like to say I think that I'm better just because I'm not gullible
I never count on a nigga for nothin'
I'm countin' the racks that I'm thumbin' through
Niggas change like the weather, the lesser the better
These days loyalty is fundable
I'll never give them the chance to do me dirty, not again, I'm vigilant
I'm focused on relatives, revenue
Focused on endeavors and dividends
I stay out the way, I'm mindin' my business
It's givin' - I'm focused on millions
When I shoot for the stars, I ain't missin' shit (Kraaa, kraaa, kraaa, kraaa)

Get rich as fuck or die broke, it's not a hard choice (It's not that hard)
Even though success is such a lonely and a long road (Yah-yah)
I could be fucked up today but the tables gon' turn tomorrow (Turn tomorrow)
One thing 'bout me no matter what, I'ma fill my torso (Yah-yah)
I came a long way (Yah-yah) and I know how far I'll go (Let's go)
To see my family straight I'll move the Kilimanjaro (Let's go)
I'ma make this earth my heaven in case that's not where we all go (It's not where we all)
I'ma make this earth my heaven in case that's not where we all go (Yah)

[Verse 2: 25K]
I came a long way, I had did the impossible
Kilo and Cizzle, I’m makin' it possible
Fell out with niggas who cap, they gullible
You ain’t even came from the trap, ke tlaba ko
Nakwe pandemic e betha re go tsaba lo (That's facts)
When she drop it low to floor shapa saka nyuka
Ke tla ba hlonolofatsa
That’s word to my name and my mom and 'em (Woah)
Smoke on a swisher like ZMF
Phounetse lawyera eng romele P&l (Hey)
0157, my dawg in trenches, he traffickin' birds to his clientele
The plug had a Motorola V360, a 3310, and an Alcatel
Visit my brother in jail
He got cuffs on his legs, look like he 'bout to bungee (Sheesh)
2008 when I made my first song, I had studio time in a mpanji (Hey)
Kilimanjaro on top of the charts
If she kept it one hundred, I’m clearin' her cart
2016 way before I had locs
I had birds on the block when I trapped out the spot
[Chorus: Nasty C]
Get rich as fuck or die broke, it's not a hard choice (It's not that hard)
Even though success is such a lonely and a long road (Yah-yah)
I could be fucked up today but the tables gon' turn tomorrow (Turn tomorrow)
One thing 'bout me no matter what, I'ma fill my torso (Yah-yah)
I came a long way (Yah-yah) and I know how far I'll go (Let's go)
To see my family straight I'll move the Kilimanjaro (Let's go)
I'ma make this earth my heaven in case that's not where we all go (It's not where we all)
I'ma make this earth my heaven in case that's not where we all go (Yah)
