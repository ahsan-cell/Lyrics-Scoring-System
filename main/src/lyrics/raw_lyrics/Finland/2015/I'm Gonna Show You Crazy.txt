There's a war inside my head
Sometimes I wish that I was dead
I'm broken
So I call this therapist
And she said, “Girl, you can’t be fixed, just take this.”

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tired of tryna to be normal
I'm always overthinkin'
I'm drivin' myself crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?
And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna show you loco, maniac
Sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, mental, out my brain
Batshit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you

I've been searching city streets
Trying to find the missing piece, like you said
And I searched hard only to find
There's not a single thing that's wrong with my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm tired of tryna to be normal
I'm always overthinkin'
I'm drivin' myself crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?
And I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?

[Chorus]
I'm gonna show you loco, maniac
Sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, mental, out my brain
Batshit, go insane
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
I'm gonna show you

[Bridge]
Crazy, crazy
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
Crazy, crazy
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
Crazy, crazy
(Yeah, yeah)
Tired of tryna be normal
I'm drivin' myself crazy
No, I don't need your quick fix
I don't want your prescriptions
Just 'cause you say I'm crazy
So what if I'm fucking crazy?
[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna show you loco, maniac
Sick bitch, psychopath
Yeah, I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna show you
