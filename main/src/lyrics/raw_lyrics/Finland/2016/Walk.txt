[Intro]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high (High)
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind (Mind)
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be fallin' all the way down

[Verse 1]
(Hundred-hundred-hundred-hundred–)
Hundred headlights makin' me blind
All of your pleasures catchin' my eye
If I jump once, then I never think twice
But your temptation's makin' me stay another night
And my senses only lie to me, lie to me
I don't know how I feel so raw to me, raw to me
I gotta check myself before I get what I want
Find out it's not what I thought it was
And you know I

[Chorus]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high (High)
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind (Mind)
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes (Eyes)
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right (Right)
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messin' around
And I'll be fallin' all the way down

Woah-woah, woah
Woah-woah

[Verse 2]
Tell myself "Leave", while I'm still strong
"Don't look back", 'til I'm ten miles gone
And when the road stops, I'm gonna keep on
Until I end up in the place that I belong
But the pressure's pushin' me back again, tellin' me not to pretend
There isn't any use even tryin' to get you out my head
So I lift my feet off the ground, and I'm gonna walk right up

[Chorus]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high (High)
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind (Mind)
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out
And I'll be fallin' all the way down
Turn my head and shut my eyes (Eyes)
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right (Right)
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messin' around
And I'll be fallin' all the way down

[Bridge]
Won't get caught in the old fly trap
Run away, run away, never come back
No way I'm goin' down like that
No, no, run away, run away
Won't— (Won't get caught in the old fly trap)
I can't get caught up again (Run away, run away, never come back)
(No way I'm goin' down like that) No way
No, no (No, no, run away, run away)
[Chorus]
Gotta slow up, gotta shake this high (High)
Gotta take a minute just to ease my mind, yeah
'Cause if I don't walk, then I get caught out (Hey)
And I'll be fallin' all the way down (I'll be fallin' all the way down, yeah)
Turn my head and shut my eyes (Shut my eyes)
Doesn't even matter if I'm wrong or right (Doesn't even matter)
'Cause if I don't walk, I keep messin' around
And I'll be fallin' all the way down, yeah

[Outro]
(Walk)
I'm gonna walk now
(Walk)
I'm gonna walk now
(Walk)
Yeah, no, (Walk) no, no
(Walk)
Better walk
(Walk)
Yeah-yeah, no, no, no (Walk), no, no, no
Oh (Walk)59
