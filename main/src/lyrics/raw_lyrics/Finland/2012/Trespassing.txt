Well, I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying, "Who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come
"No Trespassing", that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
"No Trespassers?" Yeah, my ass
Wait 'til ya get a load of me
(Come on)

[Verse 1]
One day I was trippin' and that's when I could see
That the ether that I tapped into could be reality
It was great, that's when I climbed that optimistic vine
Once I hit that mountain peak, I began to lose my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine, yeah
Make their faces crack
There's no turning back
Let's go!
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying, "Who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come
"No Trespassing", that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
"No Trespassers?" Yeah, my ass
Wait 'til ya get a load of me
Hey, ooh, oh

[Verse 2]
I ain't got BS in my bag
That's the one thing you can believe
My heart is gold, my body is glass
Come on, baby, can't you see?
I don't need no GPS
To show me where to go
But I can turn into the North Pole
And show you what is cold (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine, yeah
Make their faces crack (Crack)
There's no turning back
Let's go
[Chorus]
Well, I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying, "Who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come
"No Trespassing", that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
"No Trespassers?" Yeah, my ass!
Wait 'til ya get a load of me
Wait 'til ya get a load of me
I said wait 'til ya get a load of me

[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge]
I ain't stayin' at home
I got places to roll
I ain't stayin' at home
No, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need no sympathy
I won't cry and whine (Yeah)
Life's my light and liberty
And I shine when I wanna shine, yeah
Let's go
[Chorus]
Well, I was walkin' for some time
When I came across this sign
Saying, "Who are you and where are you from?"
We don't like when visitors come
"No Trespassing", that's what it said
At least that's what I could read
"No Trespassers?" Yeah, my ass!
