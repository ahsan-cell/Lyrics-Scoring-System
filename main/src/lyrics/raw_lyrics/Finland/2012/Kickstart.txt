Not giving up, ain't no way
Shake it off like " Ain't No Thing! "
Just let the haters hate
Shake it off like " Ain't No Thing! "

[Hook: Redrama]
So now your world broke down
You give it a kick-start
You only see the light when it's pitch-dark
You can't give up on me, we've come this far
You're on, you're on your way

[Verse 1: Redrama]
You fall, then you get up
Walk with your head up
Starting to lit up
You stronger, you see
So don't ever give up
You'll never live up
To whatever other people
Want you to be
It's only a race against yourself
So get ready to break the train off rail
They hit you hard, but ain't gone kill
So just follow your heart, you ain't gone fail I Still do it for the love and the thrill
Proving I got nothing to prove, something to build
I had to be found to see I'm lost
And I had to be the clown to be the boss
Rap.......? Fuck it
Acting mad cool in the back of the classroom
Crabs in a bucket
One get away, two, three, four follow
Red getting payed
Who, me....? C'mon

I said who's that freckled-face boy?
Getting picked on in school
Let's get him (get him), hit him (hit him)
Hate that kid and
My sister think he cool I said God damn! There he go
But he don't act like a rapper should...
Still get the girl, he rock the world
How the fuck can he rap so good?
Picking, picking, picking on the small
If you don't fit in, fit in, fit in in the mall
Girl skinny, skinny, not eating at all
Cus ain't no ass on a Barbie doll Cynic, cynics a turn me off
Cus I keep telling the kids: " The World Is Yours "
Black, White, yellow, Brown or Bronze
Tell them YOU count, don't count your flaws
