I don't wanna say I'm sorry
'Cause I know there's nothing wrong
Don't be afraid
There's no need to worry
'Cause my feelings for you are still strong

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
'Cause I need you so

[Chorus]
I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me
Is there a reason why?
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold me in your arms
Hold me in your arms
And never let me go
Hold me in your arms
'Cause I need you so

[Chorus]
I can see it in your eyes
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me
Is there a reason why?
There is something
Something you wanna tell me
I see it in your eyes
There is something
That you hide from me
