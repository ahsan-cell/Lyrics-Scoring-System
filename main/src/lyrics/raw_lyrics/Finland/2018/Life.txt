I've got life

[Verse 1: E-Type, Nana & Jeanette]
One more time
I leave behind just burning bridges
It's a crime
I am here
There must be somewhere I can breathe
Now take me there

It's time to see
I wanna make you breathe
Life can be whatever, what you want it to be
You need the key
I'm gonna make you see
No more make belive, you just go

[Hook: Nana & Jeanette]
I've got life
You're always on my mind
You gotta believe in something, alright
Forever by your side
I've got life
Just give me time to find
Whatever it is it will be alright
Forever by your side
