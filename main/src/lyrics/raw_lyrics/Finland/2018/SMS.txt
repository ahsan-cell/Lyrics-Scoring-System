I'm sending you an SMS
I'm sending you an S-SMS

[Verse 1]
I've got the phone, I wanna call you
I'm alone, I've got you under my skin
Is there some way I can win?

[Pre-Chorus]
Is there some way, for me to say
I think about you every day
What can I do? I feel so blue
I've gotta get this message to you

[Chorus]
I'm sending you an SMS
I'm sending you an S-SMS
I'm feeling that it would be the best
To send you an S-SMS

[Verse 2]
With every bleep my heart it crumbles
I cannot sleep
I hear your voice in my mind
You've got my heart on the line
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Is there some way, for me to say
I think about you every day
What can I do? I feel so blue
I've gotta get this message to you

[Chorus]
I'm sending you an SMS
I'm sending you an S-SMS
I'm feeling that it would be the best
To send you an S-SMS
I'm sending you an SMS
I'm sending you an S-SMS
I'm feeling that it would be the best
To send you an S-SMS

[Bridge]
It's not too late, communicate
Just grab the bait and trust in fate
What can I do? I feel so blue
I've got to get that message to you
(S-S-SMS-SMS-SMS)

[Chorus]
I'm sending you an SMS
I'm sending you an S-SMS
I'm feeling that it would be the best
To send you an S-SMS
I'm sending you an SMS
I'm sending you an S-SMS
I'm feeling that it would be the best
To send you an S-SMS
I'm sending you an SMS
