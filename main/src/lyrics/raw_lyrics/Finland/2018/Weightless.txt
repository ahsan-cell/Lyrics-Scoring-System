Just one word and it sends me right into outer space
This boy makes me feel alive


You got me like I'm in a haze
Got me skying on a feeling
I'm weightless, like I'm weightless under you
I feel wasted, right out of the blue
Yeah, I'm weightless like a burdens off my shoulders
It's crazy
And gravity cannot hold on me
No hold on me
No hold on me
No hold, and gravity cannot hold on me
No hold on me
No hold on me
No hold
Felt like I was walking, weights under my feet
Yeah only yesterday
Boy let's keep them talkin'
No parachute, I'm not afraid
Got me skying on a feeling
I'm weightless, like I'm weightless under you
I feel wasted, right out of the blue
Yeah, I'm weightless like a burdens off my shoulders
It's crazy
And gravity cannot hold on me
No hold on me
No hold on me
No hold, and gravity cannot hold on me
No hold on me
No hold on me
No hold
Cuz I'm weightless, like I'm weightless under you
I feel wasted, right out of the blue
Yeah, I'm weightless like a burdens off my shoulders
It's crazy
And gravity cannot hold on me
Music
No hold on me
No hold on me
No hold
I'm weightless, like I'm weightless under you
I feel wasted, right out of the blue
Yeah, I'm weightless like a burdens off my shoulders
It's crazy
It's crazy
Now baby I'm come
Like I'm on ecstasy
Baby you're the one
My real life fantasy
No hold
Cuz I'm weightlessYou might also like
