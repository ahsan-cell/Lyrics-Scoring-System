I see right through to you
See right through to you
See right through to you

[Verse 1]
I see right through to you
It's not like I don't feel your mood
What you have for me is different
Than the rest that moves
I'll be positive I know that I could be there too
'Cause you have it all, have it all

[Chorus]
I see right through to you
See your every move
See right through to you
See your every move

[Bridge]
I know you now
I reach your mind
You've shown somehow
What I could find
On the inside
There you will see
We're all alike
You and me
You might also like[Chorus]
I see right through to you
See your every move
See right through to you
See your every move
