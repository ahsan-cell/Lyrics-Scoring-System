Priviet! Menya zavut E-Type! Nazdarovie!

[Refrain]
When the seas are rolling in
When the stars are shining clear
When the ghosts are howling near
When we sing the Russian lullaby

[Verse 1]
In the night, in the night
Let's you and me together leave for higher ground
When you are all alone just listen to the sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Lullaby
We fall asleep when we hear...
Lullaby
We fly away when we hear...
Lullaby
We travel far when we hear...
Lullaby
When we hear the Russian lullaby...

[Chorus]
In the night, when the seas are rolling in
In the night, when the stars are shining clear
In the night, when the ghosts are howling near
In the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby

In the night, when we sing the Russian lullaby
