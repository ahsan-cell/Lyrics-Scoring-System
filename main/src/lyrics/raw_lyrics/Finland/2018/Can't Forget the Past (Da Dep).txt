Yeah
I been judged, I been cursed
These last few years ain't been (...easy)
I've had to work on my
(...breathing)
I crashed my way through the (...seasons)
I been broke, I been hurt
These past few months ain't been (...breezy)
I know you must don't be-(...lieve me)
Spent way too long on my (knees)
Watch my phone, pray you call
Hopin' some day you gon' (...need me)
My mama say I'm not (...eatin')
She damn near cried when she (...seen me)
But she know my smile, dangerous
I show my teeth, you get (...wheezy)
You screamin' out "don't de-(...ceive me)"
I'm bleedin' out, don't you (...leave me...please...please)
Wasn't perfect, I know, I know
And I could've been better
(I know, I know)
And I should've been better
(I know, I know)
And I would've been better
(I know, I know)
I was focused on cheddar
(I know)
Baby got fed up
(I know)
Never meant to upset her
(I know, I know)
Now she got a vendetta
(I know, I know)
I'm not like them other niggas, baby, you know
I know, you know you my uno
Nevermind what we been through though
Highs been high, the lows been too low
Couldn't give a fuck 'bout who know
Watch me duck and dodge a culo
Give yo' weight and I'll be sumo
Papi Chulo, wish I knew mo'
'Bout the fact that be the last time I'd feel...

[Verse 2]
...that that would be the last I'd get to, uh
Share with you my passing presence/past and presents
You...found me with my peace protected
Then...left me when I least expected
Right...left a lasting first impression
I...first to last and ask the question
"Girl...what's yo' take on drastic measures?
I'm...way to past the pass' aggressive"
We...couldn't seem to craft a reci-pe (never seemed we'd get past the...)
'Less it's for disasters pleasure, damn (recipe for disaster)
Alls to say I can't forget ya
But...can't say it was lack of effort, heuh
Said that we would last forever, uh
Now you just a past endeavour, damn
Guess we couldn't stand the weather, man
Nothin' ever lasts forever, no

Tryna focus - on us, on us
Broke down, broke up - so what, so what?
Blowed up, growed up - hol'up, hol'up
Slowed up, rolled up - sho' nuff, sho' nuff
Too lil too late - no one shown up
Don't mind, I'm shcrayt - hol'up, hol'up
Didn't no one care - fold up, sold up
On time, I'm there - sho' nuff, sho' nuff
Broke down, broke up - so what, so what?
Blowed up, growed up - hol'up, hol'up
Slowed up, rolled up - sho' nuff, sho' nuff
