When I saw you standing there in the darkness
I remembered the tale
It was about a queen who asked the mirror

[Chorus: Isabelle Heitman]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me what I'm looking for
Look into my eyes and see
Tell me who it's gonna be
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me what I'm looking for
I gotta know, I needa know, I gotta know

[Verse 1: Thomas Nordin]
Check me, ragga man talk to the ragga man rock
As the clock goes tic-ticky-tic-toc
Me no worry, me no worry
If it's alright me no time to hurry
Tell the queen that me is in the castle
Look into the mirror but there's no hustle
Hear the tale in a ragga man way
So listen to what me wanna say

[Chorus: Isabelle Heitman]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me what I'm looking for
Look into my eyes and see
Tell me who it's gonna be
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me what I'm looking for
I gotta know, I needa know, I gotta know

Straight up to the top, we fight (Fight)
Woun't we make it no more (No more)
I've been traveling the seven seas before

[Chorus: Isabelle Heitman]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me what I'm looking for
Look into my eyes and see
Tell me who it's gonna be
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Tell me what I'm looking for

Me wanta, me wanta know, me gotta know

Ragga digga dang get ready to prove man
Make connection, for perfection
Milli-milli-mirror in the glass-section
In follow me, me inform you
Me listen to a tale, me sure it's true
So hear the tale in a ragga man way
So listen to what me wanna say

[Chorus: Isabelle Heitman]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
