It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short walk
They walk by the cross
And they look at the cross
They look at the sky

[Chorus]
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
It's a fine day

[Whistling]

[Verse]
It's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short walk
They walk by the cross
And they look at the cross
They look at the sky
You might also likeIt's a fine day
People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short walk
They walk by the cross
And they look at the cross
They look at the sky

[Chorus]
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow

It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow

[Whistling]

[Chorus]
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow

It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow
