In oh so many ways
If you wanna be a superstar
Oh you have to go so far

Do this, do that
Oh my God you look too fat
If you wanna be a millionaire
Just act like you don´t care
Sing something like this...

La la la la la la la la...

Hey, okay
Could you please do what I say
Remember now that I´m the superstar
Did you see my brand new car

I go here, I go there
Paparazzis everywhere
Now I´m finally a millionaire
And the truth is I don´t care
All because of this...

La la la la la la la la...

Was just to be a superstar
All I needed
Was just to drive a fancy car
I didn't know that
A star would have to work this hard
The only thing that I can sing is la la la la la la la...

La la la la la la la la
