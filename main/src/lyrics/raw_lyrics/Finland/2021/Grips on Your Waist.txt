Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away

[Hook]
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray to make it back in one piece
Grips on your waist, front way, back way
You know that I don't play
Streets not safe but I never run away
Even when I'm away
Oti, oti
There's never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray, I pray
That's why I need a one dance
Much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray to make it back in one piece

I need a one dance
Is never much love when we go OT
I pray to make it back in one piece
I pray to make it back in one piece2
