I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
And you'll see I can be all you need

[Chorus: Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
And you'll s- I can be all you need
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine-
Hold on to me, pretty baby
And you'll see I can be all you need
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
And you'll s- I can be all you need
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine-
Hold on to me, pretty baby
And you'll see I can be all you need

[Outro: Shiloh Dynasty]
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
And you'll see I can be all you need

[Verse: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Stayin' alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth, yo, rockin' the gold tooth, 'Lo goose
Only way I begin the G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this, son
Rollin' with this one and that one, pullin' out gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen
Who was a fiend, started smokin' woolies at 16
And runnin' up in gates and doin' hits for high stakes
Makin' my way on fire escapes
No question, I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question, I would flow off and try to get the dough all
