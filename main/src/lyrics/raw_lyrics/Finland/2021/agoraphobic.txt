Yeah, yeah, hey

[Verse]
'Cause I can't do shit right, I can't learn my lesson
I can't do shit right, take anti-depressants
Illness and welfare robbed my adolescence
My friends probably hate me, can't answer a message
Filled with anxiety, always be hidin' me
Feelin' inadequate's always what's drivin' me
Not a role model, that's not what I strive to be
Can't go outside, I'm afraid they'd be findin' me
Paranoid 'bout my privacy, yeah
And they always askin' questions 'bout my face, can't relate
Fuckin' caught my own reflection, broke a mirror the other day
Got a lot of bad shit that I'm takin' to my grave
Got a fuckin' date with death, on house arrest 'til trial date
So I grab the red wine on rainy days and then I pour it
'Cause I'll age another fuckin' thousand days before I know it
Yeah, I spend 'em all inside, waste my time while I'm scrollin'
But I love when it rains 'cause I'm agoraphobic

[Interlude]
Alright, be easy, this is the last one you'll get

[Outro]
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
I'm not okay, I'm not okay
What's the point? I'm not okay
What's the point? I'm not okay
This shit is fuckin' difficultYou might also like140
