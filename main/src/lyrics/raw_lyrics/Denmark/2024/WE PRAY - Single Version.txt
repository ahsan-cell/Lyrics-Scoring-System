Woah
Oh
And so we pray
Ooh

[Verse 1: Chris Martin]
I pray that I don't give up, pray that I do my best
Pray that I can lift up, pray my brother is blessed
Praying for enough, pray Virgilio wins
Pray I judge nobody and forgive me my sins
I pray we make it, pray my friend will pull through
Pray as I take it unto others, I do
Praying on your love, we pray with every breath
Though I'm in the valley of the shadow of death

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Little Simz, Burna Boy]
And so we pray
For someone to come and show me the way
And so we pray
For some shelter and some records to play
And so we pray
We'll be singing "Baraye"
Pray that we make it to the end of the day
And so we pray
I know somewhere that Heaven is waitin'
And so we pray
I know somewhere there's something amazin'
And so we pray
I know somewhere we'll feel no pain
Until we make it to the end of the day

I pray that love will shelter us from our fears
Oh, I pray you trust to let me wipe off your tears
Confront all the pain that we felt inside
With all the cards we been dealt in life
Pray I speak my truth and keep my sisters alive
So for the ones who parted seas (Ah, yeah)
For the ones who's followin' dreams (Ah, yeah)
For the ones who knocked down doors (Ah, yeah)
And allowed us to pass down keys (Ah, yeah)
Pray that we speak with a tongue that is honest
And that we understand how to be modest
Pray when she looks at herself in the mirror
She sees a queen, she sees a goddess

[Chorus: Chris Martin, Chris Martin & Little Simz, Burna Boy]
And so we pray
For someone to come and show me the way
And so we pray
For some shelter and some records to play
And so we pray
We'll be singin' "Baraye"
Pray that we make it to the end of the day
And so we pray
I know somewhere that Heaven is waitin'
And so we pray
I know somewhere there's something amazin'
And so we pray
I know somewhere we'll feel no pain
Until we make it to the end of the day
[Bridge: Burna Boy]
On my knees, I pray, as I sleep and wake
'Cause inside my head is a frightening place
Keep a smiling face, only by His grace
'Cause love's more than I can take, hey

[Chorus: Chris Martin & Little Simz, Chris Martin, Burna Boy, Chris Martin, Elyanna & TINI]
And so we pray
For someone to come and show me the way
And so we pray
For some shelter and some records to play
And so we pray
We'll be singin' "Baraye"
Till nobody's in need and everybody can say (Oh)

La-la-la, la-la, la-la (La-la)
La-la-la, la-la, la-la (La-la-la, la)
La-la-la, la-la, la-la (Sing it to me)
La-la-la, la-la, we pray, we pray
La-la-la, la-la, la-la (I know somewhere that Heaven is waitin', is waitin')
La-la-la, la-la, la-la (I know somewhere there's something amazin', something amazin')
La-la-la, la-la, la-la (Until we feel no pain)
La-la-la, la-la, we pray, we pray
