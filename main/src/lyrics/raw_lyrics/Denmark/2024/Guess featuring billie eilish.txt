Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

[Verse 1: Charli xcx]
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about (Yeah)

[Chorus: Charli xcx]
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious
(Work it out)

[Verse 2: Billie Eilish]
Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about
You might also like[Chorus: Billie Eilish]
I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it
(Knows I'd hit it)
Charli, call me if you're with it

[Bridge: Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx & Billie Eilish]
Yeah, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess
Guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess, guess

[Outro: Charli xcx, Billie Eilish, Charli xcx & Billie Eilish]
You wanna guess what me and Billie have been textin' about? (We've been disrespectful)
Still tryin' to guess the password to my Google Drive (Are you obsessed with me?)
You wanna guess the address of the party we're at (You know you're not invited)
You wanna guess if we're serious about this song13
