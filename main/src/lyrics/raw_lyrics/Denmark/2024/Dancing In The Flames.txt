(Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Traffic dies while we are racin' home
Melted lights cover the open road
I hope we make it 'cause I've been chasin'
Another odyssey, oh

[Chorus]
I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, yeah

[Verse 2]
"The world can't heal," they say on the radio (Oh, no)
So grab the wheel, want you to be in control
We're dodgin' headlights, and you say, "Hold tight"
Another odyssey, oh, hey

I can't wait to see your face
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames
It's indescribable

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Indescribable), oh
Ooh
[Bridge]
Everything's faded, we barely made it
The fire's ragin' but you're still beautiful
And it's amazin' 'cause I can taste it
Our final odyssey, oh

[Chorus]
I can't (I can't) wait to see your face (Can't wait to see, ha)
Crash when we're switchin' lanes
My love's beyond the pain (Hey)
But if I miss the brake
We're dancin' in the flames (Dancin' in the flames)
So just have faith (Just have faith in me)
We'll never be the same (We'll never be, never be)
It's indescribable
[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Indescribable), oh, hey
Ooh (Indescribable)15
