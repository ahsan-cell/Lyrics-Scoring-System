I'm not really jealous
I just can't stop scrolling down your wall
And I'm not overthinking it
I've just been going through it all
Tell me if you do the same
And if you do, do you get emotional?
I'm not really jealous
I just can't stop scrolling down your wall

[Chorus: Christopher & Griff]
Out of all these places I run into you now
And after all these phases I've been going through
This is the worst time
Why you gotta look so good?
Making it worse, making it hurt
Making me realise
It could have been us, it could have been love
It could have been easy, but we made it so hard
It could have been something, but I fucked it all up
Making it worse, making it hurt
Making me realise
It could have been us

[Verse 2: Griff]
Of course, no, I'm not doing fine
But I don't want your sympathy (Oh)
I'm pretty sure I'm missing you in ways
That you're not missing me
Oh, could you say that thing again?
Could you make me cry again?
'Cause I'm forgetting all the reasons
That we ended up best friends, oh
But I'll make my peace
With the version of the two of us
I'm sad I'll never get to see (Oh)

And I don't want to know if your lips touching hers (Oh, no, I don't)
If you finally found all the things you deserve (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
I don't wanna know where you're going, who you're with
What you look like

[Chorus: Christopher & Griff, Griff]
Out of all these places I run into you now
And after all these phases I've been going through
This is the worst time
Why you gotta look so good?
(Yeah, you're making it worse)
Making it worse, making it hurt
Making me realise
It could have been us, it could have been love
It could have been easy, but we made it so hard
It could have been something, but I fucked it all up
Making it worse, making it hurt
Making me realise
It could have been us

[Post-Chorus: Christopher & Griff]
Oh-oh (It could have been us)
Should have been, would have been, could have been us
(Ah, ah-ah-ah-ah) It would have been us (Oh)
It could have been us
(It could have been us) Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
Could have been, would have been, should have been us (Yeah)
It could have been us
[Outro: Christopher, Christopher & Griff]
And I tried to break the ice, but I looked into your eyes
And realised my only choice was a big fat lie
When you asked me, "You're happy, right?"
