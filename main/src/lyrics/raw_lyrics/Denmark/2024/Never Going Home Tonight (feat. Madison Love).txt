Heatwave state of mind
Said, "DJ, play that sad song one more time"
After afterparty high
I keep searching for the signs in the neon light

[Chorus]
We're never going home tonight
Life is a dream, we'll sleep when we die
No, we're never going home tonight
Hold on to me, it's a hell of a ride
Hotter than a heartthrob speeding in a drop-top
When he's running from the cops
I can make your wild thoughts sweeter than a lemon drop
We're never going home tonight

[Drop]
We're never going home tonight
We're never going home tonight

[Verse 2]
Coke in the bathroom stall
Said, "Taste me on your lips like I'm alcohol"
One more kiss before last call
Yeah, baby, who says I can't have it all?
You might also like[Chorus]
We're never going home tonight
Life is a dream, we'll sleep when we die
No, we're never going home tonight
Hold on to me, it's a hell of a ride
Hotter than a heartthrob speeding in a drop-top
When it's running from the cops
I can make your wild thoughts sweeter than a lemon drop
We're never going home tonight

[Drop]
We're never going home tonight
We're never going home tonight
