It will be like heaven for us
For us
It will be like heaven for us

I wanna be your only lover
I wanna be a part of you

I was fixing up your hair
We were going everywhere
Look what we went through
Always me and you
And you

One day I’ll have it
It will be like heaven for us
Yeah, me and you
Always me and you
Always me and you

I know that you love me
I know that you need me

And I’ve tried many things to own your soul
I hope that
One day I’ll havе it
It will be like heavеn for usYou might also like
