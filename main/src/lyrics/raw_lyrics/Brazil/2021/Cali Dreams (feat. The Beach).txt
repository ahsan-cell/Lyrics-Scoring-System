Oh, something's burning up inside me
Yeah, I need to let go
And were you laying in my bed or was I dreaming?
I don't wanna know

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you're a dream, a fabrication of wonder
Your stars, I need to lay under
You're where I wanna be
Into your light of love and deep expectation
Inhale the green, let it take us
And watch us fade away

[Chorus]
In Cali-California
Somewhere in heaven and I want you
Your wildest visions always come true
And I need your love
So tell me what you dream of
Is it the rhythm of a sweet love?
'Cause I've been craving something real, love
And I need your touch

[Pre-Drop]
(Yes, I need, yes, I need)
(Yes, I need, yes, I need)
(Yes, I need, yes, I need)
(Yes, I need, yes, I need)
(Yes, I need, need, need, need, need)

[Verse 2]
Oh, I lay here thinking of you now
I can't deny it that I want you, baby
Just one touch, it ain't enough
I crave your taste now, is it lust? Maybe

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, your scent, it's got me, now I'm addicted
So rich, I need to bathe in it
Oh, baby, night and day
You take me higher, darling, we don't need ceilings
They'll only stop us from dreaming
It could be you and me

[Chorus]
In Cali-California
Somewhere in heaven and I want you
Your wildest visions always come true
And I need your love
So tell me what you dream of
Is it the rhythm of a sweet love? (Yeah)
'Cause I've been craving something real, love
And I need your touch
[Pre-Drop]
(Yes, I need, yes, I need)
(Yes, I need, yes, I need)
(Yes, I need, need, need, need, need)
