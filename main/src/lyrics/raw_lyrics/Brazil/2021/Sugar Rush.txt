A reel plays with clips from the previous episode.
CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM, DAY
Cut to an establishing shot of the house, then inside. Doctor Nielsen uses a stethoscope to listen to Wanda’s belly. After a few moments of listening, he takes the stethoscope away.

DR. NIELSEN: Yep, definitely pregnant.

He gets up and puts his stethoscope in his bag.

WANDA: Oh. Well, that much we figured.

VISION: It’s just kind of taken us by surprise. It’s just kind of sudden, quite suddenly, wasn’t it? I mean, practically ovеrnight. I mean, how did this happen?

DR. NIELSEN: You see, when a man and a woman lovе each other very much-

WANDA: Well, we’re just tickled pink. Or blue!

DR. NIELSEN: You’re at about four months now, is that right?

Wanda nods. Vision shakes his head. They look at each other and Vision switches to nodding.

DR. NIELSEN: I thought as much. We let the little ladies keep tabs on their growing babies with fruit. Makes it simple for them.
Wanda and Vision give each other looks.

DR. NIELSEN: At four months, the fetus is about as big as a pear. At five months, a papaya. Six, grapefruit. Seven, pineapple. Eight, honeydew.

VISION: Hypothetically speaking, what size fruit would it be at say, hmm, twelve hours?

DR. NIELSEN: Uh, pardon? Twelve hours?

WANDA: Well, I think this line of questioning is fruitless.

VISION: Well, hypothetically speaking, should we be concerned?

DR. NIELSEN: Hypothetically speaking, ever new father-to-be gets nervous.

VISION: Well, I have nerves of steel, so there goes your their, Mr. Doctor-

WANDA: Vision, why don’t you see the doctor out?

VISION: Good idea, yes.

Vision walks with the doctor to the front door.

VISION: Thank you so much for dropping by, Dr. Nielsen.

Wanda smiles and walks to the kitchen while rubbing her belly. Vision and Dr. Nielsen walk out of the house.
DR. NIELSEN: Well, I’m just glad you caught me in time. I’m taking the wife on vacation this afternoon.

VISION: Oh, have a nice holiday. Hey, Herb!

Vision waves at Herb next door, who is trimming some hedges.

HERB: Hey, buddy!

Herb waves back. Vision turns back to the doctor.

VISION: Listen, can you keep news of Wanda’s…

He makes a noise and mimes around his belly.

VISION: You know, just between us, because, uh, I don’t know. Everything’s happening so quickly. We’d like to keep the news just in the family for right now.

DR. NIELSEN: Of course. Mum’s the word. I’m off. Bermuda, baby!

He pumps his fist. Vision does too in response. Vision looks over and sees Herb, who is running his hedge trimmer through the wall separating their properties.

VISION: Hey, Herb! Think you might have taken the hedge-trimming a little too far there, old chum.

HERB: So I have. Thanks, buddy.

Herb continues to saw through the wall.
VISION: Yeah… Don’t mention it.

Vision walks back inside.

VISION: Huh. Strangest thing just happened outside with Herb- Woah, Nelly!

Wanda turns, revealing herself to be much more visibly pregnant than before.

VISION: Have you gotten bigger?

WANDA: Have I?

She turns, knocking some fruit off of a table. Vision uses super speed to grab a papaya before it hits the ground.

WANDA: I can’t tell from this angle.

VISION: I can’t wait-

He giggles while holding the papaya up.

VISION: -to be a proud papaya.

Some time later, Wanda telekinetically assembles a crib in a nursery room. She begins to paint the walls. Vision sits in a chair and reads from a parenting book.

VISION: “Nesting: The overwhelming urge during pregnancy to clean, organize, and prepare the home for the new baby.”

WANDA: See? You’re an expert already.

She opens a box of decorations and flies them up above the crib.

VISION: Well, nothing to worry about outside of morning sickness, mood swings, aching back, and feet… Darling, you should probably sit down.

He gets up.

WANDA: Don’t be silly. All I feel is excitement, happiness, and- Oh!

She looks down at her belly.

VISION: Kicking? Already?

He feels her belly.

VISION: Wow!

WANDA: Oh, it’s such a strange sensation. It’s kind of fluttery.

She laughs. Nearby, some butterfly shaped decorations turn into actual butterflies.

WANDA: Oh, did I do that? I didn’t mean to.

A butterfly lands on Vision’s nose.

VISION: Oh, uh, darling.

WANDA: Oh.

She gently removes the butterfly.

VISION: Hello, little fella.

Wanda opens a window to let the butterflies out.

VISION: Well, if that was the first kick, that puts you at about six months! Boy, oh, boy, I thought I had super speed. I can’t keep up. Please don’t misinterpret. I can’t wait to meet you, little Billy.

He kisses Wanda’s belly.

WANDA: Billy?

VISION: Yeah.

WANDA: Well, I was thinking Tommy. Just a nice, classic, all-American name.

VISION: Hmm, Tommy. Hmm. Then there’s Billy, isn’t there. Named after William Shakespeare. “All the world’s a stage. All the men and women, merely players.

WANDA: Well, I guess there’s only one solution to this debate. Hope for a girl.

She paints a stork on the wall.

VISION: Well, we ought to decide soon. I estimate the baby’s due… It’s not a constant progression, assumingly logarithmic, but were I to graph the fetal developments thus far…

WANDA: He’s gonna be here before you figure it out.

VISION: ...nearest I can conclude is that Billy-

WANDA: Tommy.

VISION: Mm… is due Friday afternoon.

WANDA: In three days? Maybe I should sit down.

Some time later, Vision looks at a doll in the living room while Wanda stands in the kitchen in the background. Vision points at the doll.

VISION: I think we have an understanding. Start the clock.

Wanda starts a timer. Vision uses his super speed to change a diaper on the doll. After a moment, he holds his hands up.

VISION: Time.

WANDA: Your personal best.

VISION: Yes! We are nothing if not prepared.

Wanda grabs her belly.

WANDA: Ooh!

VISION: Darling?

WANDA: Ooh. Do any of your books talk about this? It’s not painful, but it’s strange.

VISION: A tightening sensation?

WANDA: Yep, that’s it.

VISION: Yes, where was it, where was it…

He looks through his books and finds it.

VISION: Braxton Hicks contractions, also known as false labor, usually starts in the third trimester. Named after John Braxton Hicks in 1875-

WANDA: Honey.

VISION: Ooh, yes, yes. Oo! Excellent.

He gets up and walks over to her.

VISION: Gives us a chance to work on our breathing exercises. It should go like this.

He demonstrates. They both breathe for a few moments.

WANDA: Yeah, it’s not working. I can still feel it

VISION: I’m sorry.

She groans. Lights begin to flicker and water in the sink begins to splash around.

WANDA: What’s happening now?

VISION: What the Dickens? Let’s abandon the kitchen!

They run out as household appliances malfunction around them. They stop in the living room as the lights begin to glow extremely bright and go back to back. Suddenly, everything stops going haywire.

WANDA: It stopped.

VISION: Yes. I’ll go check on the neighbors.

WANDA: Yes.

CUT TO: INT. PHIL JONES’S HOUSE, DAY
Jones is reading a newspaper. His wife walks in.

MRS. JONES: Phil? Do these earrings make me look fat?

The lights suddenly go out.

JONES: Oh, thank God.

CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM, DAY
Vision enters through the front door.

VISION: It appears that the whole block is out.

WANDA: Oh, and that was just a fake contraction. Who knows what will happen when the real thing starts?

She sits on the couch.

WANDA: Do you think they know it’s my fault?

VISION: Our neighbors?

WANDA: Well, yes, with all the close calls we’ve been having, it seems the people of Westview are always on the verge of discovering our secret.

VISION: Yes, I know what you mean.

He gets a strange look on his face.

VISION: But it’s more than that, isn’t it.

He sits next to her on the couch.

VISION: Mr. and Mrs. Hart, dinner. Outside with Herb. I think something’s wrong here, Wanda.

The shot skips and suddenly cuts back to before Vision sat down.

VISION: Yes, I know what you mean. The truth is, we are in uncharted waters, and you know what?

He sits as he talks.

VISION: I’m anxious, too.

WANDA: We just don’t know what to expect.

VISION: Nope.

WANDA: Will the baby be human, or synthezoid? A bit of both?

VISION: If he’s anything like his ma, Billy will be perfect.

WANDA: You mean Tommy.

VISION: Mm.

She suddenly gasps.

VISION: Oh, no, darling, are you alright?

WANDA: This is a real one!

VISION: What?

He floats up into the air.

WANDA: I thought you said Friday afternoon!

VISION: Well, I didn’t consider that the timings between developmental benchmarks could be quite random!

Wanda begins doing the breathing exercises. Vision joins in and floats back to the ground. Wanda gets up and grabs his hands.

WANDA: Better.

VISION: Yes, darling, thank you, it’s passing.

Thunder rumbles and rain begins pouring inside the room.

WANDA: Vis.

VISION: Yes dear?

WANDA: I think my water just broke.

VISION: Yes dear.

CUT TO: COMMERCIAL BREAK
Two kids are playing with a soccer ball in the background while a woman eats cereal in the foreground. The ball flies towards the woman and knocks her cereal bowl, spilling milk. The shot zooms out and we see another shot of a dog peeing in the kitchen.

WOMAN: No, no, no, no!

The shot zooms out again and a third one pops up of the woman taking burnt food out of the oven while one of the kids stands next to her.

DAUGHTER: Sorry, mom.

WOMAN: Oh.

The shot zooms out again and a fourth one pops up of the woman blending something. The lid pops off and the blended mix goes all over the counter. The shot zooms out a final time. The woman walks in front of the compilation of shots. She turns when the narrator begins speaking.

NARRATOR: Do you need a break?

WOMAN: You read my mind.

NARRATOR: Come with me.

The woman closes her eyes and relaxes. The shot fades to another shot of her in a bathtub.

NARRATOR: Escape to a world all your own, where your problems float away. When you wanna get away, but you don’t wanna go anywhere…

A picture of Soap comes up on screen, with text that reads, “Find the Goddess Within!”

NARRATOR: Hydra Soak. Find the Goddess within.

CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM, DAY
Wanda and Vision hide from the indoor rain under a table.

VISION: Well, I was just reading about the advantages of water birth.

The rain suddenly stops.

WANDA: Oh, thank goodness.

Vision begins to get out from under the table.

VISION: Let me help you up, dear. There you go.

He helps her up while she groans.

WANDA: What a mess!

She uses her powers to bring a gust of wind into the room. Vision struggles not to get blown backwards. Everything dries off.

WANDA: Oh, that’s better.

She begins to groan again.

WANDA: Darling, do you think it’s time to-

VISION: Call the doctor?

He runs off.

WANDA: Yeah.

VISION: Yes I do, dear.

He grabs the landline in the kitchen, then puts it back up.

VISION: Damn, the phones are down, too. I better run. Except he might have already left for vacation!

WANDA: Where? At a time like this?

VISION: Well, in fairness, darling, the baby is approximately nine months early. I better leg it. You’ll be alright here?

WANDA: Mhm.

He kisses her and runs out of the house with super speed. Wanda gasps and grabs her belly. As she breathes, she hears a strange noise in the nursery. She slowly makes her way over, but the doorbell rings and startles her before she goes in.

WANDA: Oh, shoot! Uh, oh!

She opens a closet and puts on a heavy coat. She opens the door and finds Geraldine.

GERALDINE: Wanda! What’s up?

Geraldine looks at Wanda’s coat curiously.

GERALDINE: It’s 75 degrees out. You making a fashion statement?

Geraldine walks in.

WANDA: Hi, Geraldine. You know, now is not really a good time.

GERALDINE: No, no, no, it’s foxy. You’ll have to let me borrow it sometime. But first, I gotta borrow a bucket. Not to wear, to use.

Wanda angrily closes the front door.

GERALDINE: Somehow, all the pipes in my ceiling burst at once and I gotta bail myself out.

WANDA: Alright, sure! Just stay right there. I think I might have a bucket in the kitchen.

Wanda jogs over to the kitchen.

GERALDINE: Well, okay, then.

Wanda enters the kitchen.

WANDA: I think it’s just here under the sink!

She yells as she says “sink,” and her coat turns into a raincoat. Geraldine yells from the living room.

GERALDINE: Are you alright in there?

WANDA: Yes, I’m just looking!

She groans again and the raincoat turns into a fur coat.

GERALDINE: I’ll come help.

Geraldine begins walking over.

WANDA: No! I mean, no thank you.

Wanda throws the coat off as Geraldine enters. Wanda quickly holds a fruit bowl in front of herself.

GERALDINE: Bingo!

She pulls a bucket out of a closet and turns to Wanda.

GERALDINE: Would you look at that.

WANDA: What?

GERALDINE: Fruit! Wanda, thank you.

She walks over and grabs an apple.

GERALDINE: Yummy.

Geraldine walks away. Wanda follows.

WANDA: Well, good luck with the leak.

GERALDINE: Oh, th- Oh! Say, Wanda, I’ve got a question for you.

Geraldine walks over to the couch.

GERALDINE: You know how I’ve been working that temp job, right?

Geraldine and Wanda both sit down.

GERALDINE: Well, my boss, Mr. Haddox, he was going crazy yesterd-

Wanda looks in shock as a stork walks up behind Geraldine.

GERALDINE: Oh, look at me going on and on like you got all the time in the world. Let me go on and get-

WANDA: Wait!

Geraldine turns back to Wanda before spotting the stork.

WANDA: Ah, no, tell me about the temp job.

GERALDINE: Oh, that’s my girl. So, yesterday my boss Mr. Haddox was going crazy working on the slogan for a new breakfast cereal. You know, the one with the little marshmallow moonmen?

WANDA: Oh?

She watches as the stork walks around the house in the background.

GERALDINE: Yeah, yeah, yeah, those. So, it’s 10 minutes before the big presentation, and Mr. Haddox has got nothing.

As Geraldine talks, Wanda tries to make the stork disappear. A puff of red smoke appears, but the stork remains.

GERALDINE: Nothing, that is, except for the worst case of hiccups I ever did see.

The stork begins to walk closer to the pair in the living room.

GERALDINE: Oh, Wanda, he couldn’t get out one word, let alone a whole pitch!

Wanda tries to make the stork disappear again, but it just flaps the red smoke away.

GERALDINE: So I’m trying every trick in the book to help this poor man. I’m hiding behind filing cabinets and jumping out when he least expects it, like, boom!

Wanda jumps and throws an orange at the stork, which runs away.

GERALDINE: Wanda!

The stork makes a noise. Geraldine gets up and looks around.

GERALDINE: What was that? Did you, did you hear that?

WANDA: No.

GERALDINE: It was like a chattering sound, like a…

WANDA: Oh! Like a-

Wanda imitates the noise of the stork.

GERALDINE: Yeah.

WANDA: That’s my new ice maker built right into the fridge.

GERALDINE: Oh! You’re fancy.

Geraldine sits back down.

GERALDINE: So now, at this point, I am helping Mr. Haddox do a handstand under the water cooler, because, you know, why not try a little upside down, drink those hiccups away. And, wouldn't you know it, in that moment, in walks the client.

Wanda watches the stork walk around the other side of the couch.

WANDA: Oh, no.

GERALDINE: Oh, yes. But you know me Wanda, I keep my cool no matter what’s goin’ down. So I look at the client, and I look at Mr. Haddox’s feet sitting in the air next to me-

The stork, unseen by Geraldine, begins nipping at her pants.

GERALDINE: -and I look back at the client, and I say, “Gravity Os: Launch into your day the right way.”

Geraldine laughs, sending the stork off into the nursery.

WANDA: Oh, thank you.

GERALDINE: Yes, and that’s exactly what Mr. Haddox said right before he told me to clean out my desk.

WANDA: Oh, no, Geraldine! He didn’t fire you.

GERALDINE: Oh, sugar. He hired me!

WANDA: Oh!

Geraldine gets up.

GERALDINE: Oh, Wanda! I landed a promotion. And now that I’ve gone all corporate, I need some office supplies. Which brings me to my question. Do y’all still keep those in your spare room?

She begins walking to the nursery.

GERALDINE: Because I was hoping you wouldn't mind sharing with your good friend.

WANDA: Wait, wait!

Geraldine walks into the nursery. The stork stands up against the painting of a stork on the wall, and Geraldine doesn’t notice. Wanda puts down the fruit basket and picks up a flower vase.

GERALDINE: Is that what I think it is?

WANDA: Oh, a stork, yes, I can explain.

GERALDINE: No, the crib!

Wanda gasps and drops the flower vase. She begins panting.

WANDA: Oh, it’s coming. Oh, the baby’s coming.

GERALDINE: You’re pregnant?

CUT TO: EXT. NIELSEN’S DRIVEWAY, DAY
Dr. Nielsen has the front of his car open. He hits his head as he backs out.

DR. NIELSEN: Ow! Bermuda awaits, and my car decides to poop out right at this moment.

He slams the lid shut. Vision arrives.

DR. NIELSEN: Well, Mr. Vision, is everything okay with the wife?

VISION: Yes, so long as we hurry!

He picks up Dr. Nielsen and sprints away at super speed. Dr. Nielsen’s wife gets out of the car.

MRS. NIELSEN: But Stan! What about my brand new two-piece?

CUT TO: INT. LIVING ROOM, DAY
Geraldine helps Wanda into the living room. Wanda is groaning.

GERALDINE: Now, let’s get you comfortable, okay?

Geraldine grabs some pillows from the couch.

WANDA: Oh, I think I’m gonna lay down right here.

Wanda lays down behind the couch. A nearby vacuum goes haywire.

WANDA: Vision ran to get the doctor, he’ll be back soon.

GERALDINE: No, no, no there’s not enough time for that. Relax, relax.

Geraldine sets up some pillows for Wanda to rest her head. She grabs the bucket and runs to the kitchen.

GERALDINE: You know your breathing, right?

Wanda breathes.

GERALDINE: Wanda, I can’t hear you?

All around the house things go haywire. Geraldine gasps when a light fixture falls onto a table.

GERALDINE: I may be late to the party, but I imagine there is a logical explanation for this.

WANDA: Oh it’s all perfectly natural!

GERALDINE: Hey, hey, you’re doing great! You’re doing great! Look at me, look at me.

She imitates the breathing pattern.

GERALDINE: Come on.

Wanda does a set of the breathing.

WANDA: I can’t do this.

GERALDINE: Yes, you can.

Wanda shakes her head.

WANDA: I can’t, I can’t.

GERALDINE: You can do this. Yes, you can, you can do this!

Geraldine checks under Wanda’s clothes.

GERALDINE: It’s time to start pushing.

WANDA: Oh.

GERALDINE: You ready?

Wanda keeps shaking her head.

GERALDINE: You’re ready. You’re ready. Push, push, Wanda, push!

Wanda yells.

GERALDINE: Push! That a girl!

Things reach a climax before finally setting down as Wanda begins to breathe normally again. Geraldine gets up holding a baby and it begins to cry.

GERALDINE: It’s a boy.

Geraldine hands the baby to Wanda.

WANDA: Hi. Hi.

She smiles.

WANDA: Oh, he’s perfect.

Vision runs in with Dr. Nielsen.

VISION: Oh, no, I missed it.

GERALDINE: Hey, doc, why don’t you help me out in the kitchen there?

DR. NIELSEN: We went so fast, it was like we were flying.

Dr. Nielsen stumbles. Geraldine helps him into the kitchen.

VISION: Oh, well done, Wanda.

He approaches her.

WANDA: Well, don’t you want to meet your son as yourself?

Vision looks around and drops his human facade. He kneels down and picks up the baby.

WANDA: Ooh, you’re strong.

VISION: Hello there, little Tommy.

WANDA: Tommy?

VISION: Yes, Tommy.

He leans in to kiss her, but she screams. He screams back in surprise.

VISION: What? Good heavens!

Wanda begins to heave.

VISION: There’s another baby coming!

WANDA: Billy?

VISION: Wanda, push, push!

She continues to yell. Cut to some time later. Dr. Nielsen holds one baby and Vision holds the other. Wanda stands between them and Geraldine sits on the couch.

DR. NIELSEN: Twenty fingers and twenty toes. You’ve got two healthy baby boys on your hands.

He hands her a baby.

WANDA: Thank you, doctor.

DR. NIELSEN: All in a day's work.

He turns to Geraldine.

DR. NIELSEN: And thank you for your assistance, young lady. I think you might have what it takes to be a nurse.

Geraldine and Wanda give each other looks.

VISION: Allow me to walk you out, doctor.

Vision places a baby in a crib.

DR. NIELSEN: Oh, alright. As long as we actually walk this time.

VISION: Come.

They leave. Geraldine gets up.

WANDA: I do owe you a debt of gratitude.

Geraldine chuckles. Outside, Dr. Nielsen and Vision walk out of the house.

VISION: Well, Dr. Nielsen, I hope you’re still able to make your trip.

DR. NIELSEN: Ah, yes, my trip. I don’t think we’ll get away after all. Small towns, you know. So hard to escape.
He leaves. Vision looks confused.

VISION: Yeah…

Vision turns to walk back inside. He notices Agnes and Herb talking in hushed tones nearby.

AGNES: What is she doing in there?

VISION: Howdy neighbors!

HERB: Hey!

AGNES: Howdy!

Anges and Herb go back to whispering. Vision turns to go inside again, but then walks over to the pair.

VISION: Remarkable day we’re having, no? Did you lose power, too?

AGNES: Oh, sure did. But Ralph looks better in the dark, so I’m not complaining.

VISION: Hi Herb.

HERB: Hey, buddy.

There’s an awkward pause.

VISION: Well, I’ll get back to Wanda.

He turns away.

AGNES: Vision.

He turns back.

AGNES: Is Geraldine inside with Wanda?

VISION: Yes, why?

Cut back inside.

GERALDINE: You’re such a strong lady.

WANDA: Oh.

She waves her hand dismissively.

GERALDINE: Can you believe this? Twins.

She pats one of the babies.

WANDA: I’m a twin. I had a brother. His name was Pietro.

Geraldine looks at Wanda somberly. Wanda begins singing a lullaby in Sokovian.

GERALDINE: He was killed by Ultron, wasn’t he?

WANDA: What did you say?

Cut back outside.

HERB: She’s new to town. Brand new.

AGNES: There’s no family. No husband.

VISION: Well, there’s nothing wrong with that.

AGNES: Hmm. No home.

VISION: What?

Cut back inside.

WANDA: What did you say… just now?

GERALDINE: I said, Wanda, you’re such a strong lady. Should I say it one more time for good measure?

She walks away and sits on the couch.

WANDA: No. What did you say about Pietro?

GERALDINE: Pietro? Uh… Hey, I’ll take a shift rocking the babies.

WANDA: No, I think you should leave.

GERALDINE: Oh, Wanda, don’t be like that.

Wanda looks at Geraldine’s necklace. Cut back outside.

VISION: What do you mean she has no home?

HERB: She came here because… She came here because… She came here because we’re all…

VISION: She came here because we’re all what? What are you trying to tell me?

Cut back inside.

WANDA: What is that?

GERALDINE: What?

WANDA: That.

Geraldine lifts up the object on her necklace.

WANDA: That symbol.

GERALDINE: I, uh, I, uh…

WANDA: Who are you?

GERALDINE: I don’t…

Cut back outside.

HERB: She came here because we’re all-

AGNES: Stop it!

Cut back inside.

WANDA: Who are you?

GERALDINE: Wanda.

Wanda backs Geraldine up against a wall.

GERALDINE: I… I… Wanda.

Cut back outside.

AGNES: Well, I better get going. That macramé’s not gonna hitch itself.

She rings a bell on her bicycle and rides away.

VISION: Herb?

HERB: Catch you on the flip side, Vision.

He walks away. Vision turns around. Cut to him entering the living room, returning to his robot form.

VISION: Wanda?

Wanda stands over the crib.

VISION: Where’s Geraldine?

WANDA: Oh, she left, honey. She had to rush home.

Wanda looks at the twins and smiles.
CUT TO: EXT. WESTVIEW OUTSKIRTS, NIGHT
Cut to a shot of a “Welcome To Westview” sign. A strange shimmer appears in the air. Geraldine is thrown backwards out of it. She lands in the grass. Cars drive up beside her. A helicopter shines a light on her from above. Armed men approach. The camera pulls back and shows a large camp set up near a shimmering wall around Westview.
