Had a feeling that you'd call me to say you're sorry
Instead you just said it's my mistake
Are you waging up a war for the sake of something to say?
When am I not to blame?
And what you got to say about me?
I don't know you very well if you're acting like someone else
And what you got to say about us
Don't you see this all leads to games, you should start- someone else
And what you got to say about us
Don't you see this all leads to games, you should start trusting me

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
Well I w-, well I w-, well I w-, well I w-
Well I w-, well I w-, well I w-, well I w-
Well, I wish I could say sorry but I don't have much to say
You won't believe me anyway
I got a thing for causin' arguments
But in my defense, I'm scared you'll walk away
And what I'm tryna say about me
I don't know me very well if I'm actin' like someone else
And what you got to say about us
Don't you see that I'm here- well if I'm actin' like someone else
And what you got to say about us
Don't you see that I'm here to stay, you should start trustin' me
