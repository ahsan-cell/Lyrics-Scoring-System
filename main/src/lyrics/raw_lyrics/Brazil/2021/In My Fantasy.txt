It's been too long I cannot wait
Can't hold me back gonna make it on my own some day
I will go into my dreams and fly away
I will go into my dreams and fly away
[Verse 1: T.I.]
Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in
Bet you would think I got it made, better look again I got buttler
Got a maid, and a mansion The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy
With pantoms and ferrari's in the driveway
But you see the pain and the change of the same man's
Your vision jaded by the grammy's on the mantelpiece
Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony
Apparantly it's damaging the man you see before you
On the canvas he may seem alright but all the diasadvantages his family
Encounters overpowers his extravagance Walk in my?
I dare you While it really seem like the kings life ain't glamourous
As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs
Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles
Only counts until it falls in the pile

[Verse 2: Eminem]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's lookin' at you, what you want me to do
I'm startin' to live like a recluse and the truth is
Fame startin' to give me an excuse, to be at a all time low
I sit alone in my home theatre, watchin' the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleepin' pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin' right
I ain't slowin' down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out
Daddy, don't you die on me, daddy, better hold your ground
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down

[Verse 3: The Game]
Who is it the gun spitter young home run hitter?
More hit you with a flow like biggie
Can hit this rap shit out the park like griffy
I meet my guns out at the park come get me
The desert eagles make a nigga move like missy
I'm always in a Bentley how the fuck could you miss me
I'm always on the charts I know why you nigga diss me
Cause black wall street gettin deeper then the 60's
Them boys in the hood will lay you down like ricky so run
Or catch them hollow tips like a Frisbee
I pinch cocaine like frank lucas niggas talk that American gansta shit but can't do it
I put these wack rap niggas in a scope and blaow cause I promised the homie cam
I would hold his brother down I'm more focused now I'm like the golden child
Put both your hands out and I'll let you hold my style

[Hook]
