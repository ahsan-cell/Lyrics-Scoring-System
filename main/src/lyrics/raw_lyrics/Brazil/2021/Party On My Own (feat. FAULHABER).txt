Play me a sad song, yeah
I wanna move, I wanna drink it by the bottle
It's complicated, yeah
But mixing feelings with tequila gets me wasted

[Pre-Chorus]
I get that message when you ignore
Blue tick on my texts and miss my calls
You take shots at me so I take note
When I hit the floor

[Chorus]
I'm dancing without you, —out you, —out you
Dancing without you, —out you, —out you
Tell strangers about you, —bout you, —bout you
You're not here to take me home
So I party on my own
I'm dancing without you, —out you, —out you
Dancing without you, —out you, —out you
We'll leave any time soon, time soon, time soon
You're not here to take me home
So I party on my own

[Verse 2]
Keep up the tempo, yeah
Don’t miss a beat, don’t miss a word
Still miss your tango
There's no debating, yeah
Remixing love songs, till my drinks gone sends me crazy
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I get that message when you ignore
Blue tick on my texts and miss my calls
You take shots at me so I take more
When I hit the floor

[Chorus]
I'm dancing without you, —out you, —out you
Dancing without you, —out you, —out you
Tell strangers about you, —bout you, —bout you
You're not here to take me home
So I party on my own
I'm dancing without you, —out you, —out you
Dancing without you, —out you, —out you
We'll leave any time soon, time soon, time soon
You're not here to take me home
So I party on my own
So I party on my own

[Outro]
I'm dancing without you, —out you, —out you
You're not here to take me home
So I party on my own
So I party on my own2
