Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel loved, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel loved, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes

[Chorus]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel loved, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
Lady, hear me tonight
'Cause my feeling, is just so right
As we dance, by the moonlight
Can't you see, you're my delight?
Lady, I just feel like
I won't get you, out of my mind
I feel loved, for the first time
And I know that it's true, I can tell by the look in your eyes
The look in your eyes

[Outro]
