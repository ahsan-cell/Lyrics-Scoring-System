Oceans in between us couldn't keep us apart
Mountains and the distance couldn’t bury our love
I would search forever, swim up
Every single river 'cause I know how it feels
And it's real

[Pre-Chorus]
Must be something in my heart that beats for you
And when it gets dark, it guides me through
Even when I’m lost, the magnet show me where you are
'Cause I've got a compass heart

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are
Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are

[Verse 2]
Closer than my skin, it's flowing in my veins
In the oxygen and every breath I take
Signals never fading like a flare, when I'm in danger
Always saving me endlessly
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there’s something in my heart that beats for you
And when it gets dark, it guides me through
Even when I’m lost, the magnet showed me where you are
'Cause I’ve got a compass heart

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are
Oh, I've got a compass heart
And in the dark
Yeah, it shows me where you are

[Bridge]
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far away
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far away
No matter how long it takes, it takes, it takes, it takes...

[Chorus]
Oh, I've got a compass heart

[Outro]
No matter how long it takes, no matter how far away
I’ll always get to ya
No matter how long it takes, just know that I'll find a way
'Cause I've got a compass heart
