Ladies and gentleman, welcome to Bras√≠lia
Football capital of the world, it'll steal ya
Life for a night, whilst you're on the edge of your seat
Biting your nails, waiting for victory or defeat
And the weak don't even compete, it's the best of the best
The rest are crying, tryna form a protest
Ibra, I'm talking to you, but wait
Let's get back on track, cause right now, yeah, right now we're...

[Chorus: Randolph]
Hitting up Brazil, what, we do it our way
Representing the world, huh, we're talking replay
I'm not gonna sing it 'til I see you got ya hands up
Sing it up, sing it up
Hitting up Brazil, what, we do it our way
Representing the world, yeah, we're talking replay
I'm not gonna sing it 'til I see you got ya hands up
Sing it up, sing it up

[Verse 2: Randolph]
This the World Cup, yeah, emotions are flying
Got the fireworks going off, Balotelli supplying
Eyeing him up is Neymar, setting off the claymore bombs
Each country is 'bout to get it on
It's do or die, a warfield, no time for failure, no time to freeze
On the other hand, you've got each team
Thinking that they can win penalties
With a psychologist, please...

Yeah, I've been waiting four years
Long time coming, now the world cup is here
You've got the players, the fans, did I mention burger flipping vans?
Thirty two teams, and maybe a bit of romance, uh
And I'm buzzing for more
My current generation play better than ever before
We've got Ronaldo, Messi, that nutty geezer Balotelli
Talk about the best, hands up if you agree

[Chorus: Randolph]
Hitting up Brazil, what, we do it our way
Representing the world, huh, we're talking replay
I'm not gonna sing it 'til I see you got ya hands up
Sing it up, sing it up
Hitting up Brazil, what, we do it our way
Representing the world, yeah, we're talking replay
I'm not gonna sing it 'til I see you got ya hands up
Sing it up, sing it up

[Verse 4: KSI]
Yeah, rise up, beat the rest
Win the cup, yeah, like I'm George Best
This here is our time, climbing to the top at our prime
Believe me as we here shine, skills so sick and sublime
Got the people cheering, screaming, as we do the dealing
Raise the roof, destroy the ceiling, even BEP be feeling
In the country of Brazil, where I like to chill
Worked hard to get up hill, now I'm worth a mill
My team I'm repping still, what you scoring? Nil
Shock the world, like I'm Lesnar
Take the lead, saying, "yes, sir"
Buzzing like a pinnacle bee, getting that nectar
[Chorus: Randolph]
Hitting up Brazil, what, we do it our way
Representing the world, huh, we're talking replay
I'm not gonna sing it 'til I see you got ya hands up
Sing it up, sing it up
Hitting up Brazil, what, we do it our way
Representing the world, yeah, we're talking replay
I'm not gonna sing it 'til I see you got ya hands up
Sing it up, sing it up6
