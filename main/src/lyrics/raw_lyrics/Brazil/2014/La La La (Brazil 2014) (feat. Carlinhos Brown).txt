Essa bola vai rolar
Mundo é um tapete verde
Quando a bola chega lá
Coração fica na rede, na rede, na rede (Olá, olá)

La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la, la (La-la-la)
La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la
La, la, la-la-la, la (I dare you)

[Verse 1: Shakira]
Feel how the planet's become one
Beats like a drum to the same rhythm
Hear the whistle, kick the ball
The entire world soars like an eagle
In Rio, we play like we dance
Only today, there's no tomorrow
Leave all behind, in this place
There's no space for fear or sorrow

You have arrived, it's the place
No more doubts, the time is coming
Feel how the planet's become one

Off the bench, you gotta own it
Down here, we play like we dance
It's Brazil, and now you know it
