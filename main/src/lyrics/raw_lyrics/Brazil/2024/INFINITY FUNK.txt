Minimum wage, minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot work for that minimum wage
Minimum wage (yah) minimum wage (yah)

Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage (yah)
Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage (ooh, yah)

[Verse 1]
Camera got minimum, I need the mems and the M again
I need my benefits, I need that business
I'm running that bitch 'til I'm out of adrenaline
Call up the jet, be like "Son, you been killing it"
Straight off the PJ, I'm right to the dealership
Then I'm back in this shit, that's how my win is spent
That's how I spit when I step back that bitch just get you a uh
Forty dollars in a day, that ain't enough for my babe
I need a house in a hills with a lake
Like "Damn, where the fuck do you stay?", ay
Water dancing on my wrists, uh
Big body with assists, yah
Give a fuck about a bitch, nah
Did some drugs, now we lit, yah

'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage (yah)
Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage (yah)

[Verse 2]
I think I need new identity, I need that big bottle Hennessey
I need my pool on infinity, fuck what y'all niggas is 'finna be
All y'all just feed off my energy
Fuck what y'all people pretend to be
Y'all move as one like a centipede
I'm out the box like you missing me
This is signed field, and sense out officially
All y'all niggas gotta die out eventually
Free smoke, free smoke (yah)
Lil bust, big folds (yah)
Lil glove, big dopes, Chi' with the crime, same as my way
Way, way, way, way, way back in '94
Why you think we working nine to fo'?
And why you think we selling rocks and blows?
Cause we all grew up on a rock and roll
We back and forth like a pendulum
Win for the summer, then back for the win again
You think you winning shit, boy, yo' ass is innocent
Ignorant to the pen, we ain't been injured and
Work through this shit like an in-school suspension
Can't whip out my cop like a bitch's extension, get
We get on road like them niggas is finished
And we wanna work, but the bands is not getting it
[Chorus]
Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage
Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage
Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage
Minimum wage, I cannot work for that minimum wage
I give you that dollar, you give me the day
'Cause I cannot fall for that minimum wage3
