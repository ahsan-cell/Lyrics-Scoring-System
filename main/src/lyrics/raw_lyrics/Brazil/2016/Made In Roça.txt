You think you're so outrageous
But I rock the scene, a misfit with attitude
No VIP, I don't need your guest list
Let's make a little mischief
When I turn up the noise
My riff stomps over your chords
You rockstar rebel (Huh, say what?)
Just bass and treble (And you're so punk)

[Pre-Chorus: Rocker Boi & Punk Grrl]
Let's get louder
Louder
Louder
OMG, let's see what you're made of

[Chorus: Punk Grrrl & Rocker Boi]
Show me what you got
I dare you to surprise me
Get up, strut your stuff
I bet you just might like me

[Verse 2: Rocker Boi, Punk Grrl & Both]
Yeah, I got that wild side
Amped up rock and roll style
The grit and the glam
I got that kinda vibe, yeah, that's who I am
And nothing's gonna stop me
Freak out, break the rules
Never sell out, scream and shout
It might sound crazy (Yeah, so what?)
I think that maybe it's just a crush
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Punk Grrrl & Rocker Boi]
Let's get louder
Louder
Louder
You just pretend you don't like my band

[Chorus: Punk Grrrl & Rocker Boi]
Show me what you got
I dare you to surprise me
Get up, strut your stuff
I bet you just might like me
Show me what you got
I dare you to surprise me
Wanna make a fuss
And jam out right beside me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Punk Grrrl, Rocker Boi, & Both]
So crank it to eleven
A match made in rock Heaven
Electric buzz like thunder and lightning
Tell me you like me
I think you like me
[Chorus: Punk Grrrl & Rocker Boi]
Show me what you got
I dare you to surprise me
Get up, strut your stuff
I bet you just might like me
Show me what you got
I dare you to surprise me
Wanna make a fuss
And jam out right beside me?

[Outro: Rocker Boi, Punk Grrl & Both]
Let's get louder
Louder
Louder
