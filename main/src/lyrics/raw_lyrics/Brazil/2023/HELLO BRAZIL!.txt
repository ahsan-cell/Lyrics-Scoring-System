Mr. Madic got a long-term plan
Make a lot of money, get some long-term stans
Make it off of oozing all these off-world jams
Golly, he a goony with the sauced purp clan, like damn
How the hell this type of caliber of challenger
Gone hop into the Octagon and battle with Excalibur
And make a gully single that is casually nastier
Than 80s stached bachelors, crazy Pabst wrestler
Fuck a boss, I’ma do it on my own
Till you clued into the tone of the buddha-written poems
Your manure isn’t known to my crew up in my home
It’s a movement of the moody till Cthulhu on the thronе
It’s a wrap, where the guac, gimmе gouda, need a lot
I need moola, I need pot, till medullas order stop
I will scuba in the coochie got an oochie wally plot
Then cop a loosie on the block, tell your boo that it’s on lock

[Hook]
Off a couple whiskeys, and I’m feeling cocky
I’ma talk my shit, and can’t nobody stop me
We gon’ do a drunken jig in back the bar, believe me
Crack me off another, bartender, I ain’t leaving
Nah nah nah-nah-nah-nah-nah
I ain’t gonna leave, so sing along
La la la la la

I’m the type of fellow saw the fire and I ran for it
You the type of fellow tiny violinists playing for
He the type of fellow that the pious throw their hands for
I’m the type of fellow cause a riot on a dance floor
Higher, I am airborne
Brain frying like it’s Hannibal who trying the supplies up in a pan store
Tired of the rancor, wilding what I stand for
Rap tyrant, keep the trident in my Jansport
I’m arriving, I been driving through the sandstorm
High school, I was writing till my hands sore
Now they all admiring and that’s why I’m building fans for
Hook em with the rhythm, then surprise em with the candor
Slam floor, put the pedal to the metal
In the belly of the beast like Ghepetto, I am settled
I am ready for the feast, fill the kettle with the venison
And ready all the mead, it’s a spectacle indeed
