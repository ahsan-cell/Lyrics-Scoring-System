*I like you so much!*
Rebecca, Lexa, POCAH, Danny Bond
*Hello, friends!*

[Verse 1: Rebecca & POCAH]
Barbie is different, full of schemes
And eviless in her mind, just want trouble
She shows herself, rocks showing her side
Walk with her friend (Ui!) craving for sex

[Pre-Chorus: Lexa & POCAH]
It's so much power that envy stops
Today I'm so hot that I would even catch myself
The butt shakes, rolls and doesn't stop
Let 'em know that today I won't be home until tomorrow

[Chorus: Rebecca, POCAH & Danny Bond]
She is no longer a princess and is full of options
Barbie is different (Push it, push it, go), she just wants thеm just to fuck her (Go, go!)
Just to fuck her, just, just to fuck her
Just to fuck hеr (Fuck, go!), just, just to fuck her

[Post-Chorus: Danny Bond & Lexa]
Barbie goes down, down, down (Are you crazy?)
Down, down, do-down
Barbie goes up, up, up
Up, up, u-p
Barbie goes down, down, down (Uh)
Down, down, do-down (Uh)
Barbie goes up, up, up (Yo)
Up, up, u-p

I'm a fucking black Barbie who arrived to teach you
Push that pile for the doll to work
You know my name, I don't even need to say it
It's not Minaj, it's Bond, you're tired of listening (Ow, ow!)
With this Barbie you feel jealous (Ow, ow)
I know you like it, it's normal
Catch Lexa, kiss POCAH, bite Rebecca
But don't forget that Bond has the doll's secret

[Interlude]
Let's play? I like to play so much!

[Pre-Chorus: Lexa & Rebecca]
It's so much power that envy stops
Today I'm so hot that I would even catch myself
The butt shakes, rolls and doesn't stop
Let 'em know that today I won't be home until tomorrow

[Chorus: POCAH & Rebecca]
She is no longer a princess and is full of options (Isn't, no)
Barbie is different, she just wants them just to fuck her (Push it, push it, go)
(Go! Ah, I want it, go!)
Just to fuck her, just, just to fuck her (Go, go)
Just to fuck her, just, just to fuck her
[Post-Chorus: Danny Bond]
Barbie goes down, down, down (Uh)
Down, down, do-down (Uh)
Barbie goes up, up, up (Yo)
Up, up, u-p

[Outro: Danny Bond]
Turn, turn the crank for the doll to work
Don't forget that it's joking that I like to attack
Hahahaha
Ah... I love you!
