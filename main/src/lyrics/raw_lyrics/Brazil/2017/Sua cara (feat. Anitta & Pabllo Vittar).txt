Major Lazer run the world

[Verse 1: Anitta]
You prepare for it, but you don't shoot
You notice it, but you don't stare
You think you're the man, but you don't stop me
You're full of wickedness, but don't face me up
You're already wanting it and I want it too
But you're full of stories and excuses
You turned into a coward, I want it bad
But you're taking forever

[Pre-Chorus: Anitta]
If you don't come, I'll put pressure on you
I won't wait for you, I have plenty of options
I'm not the kind of woman to put up with preaching
Stare at me, get ready
'Cause I'm gonna throw it right in your face

[Chorus: Anitta]
Right in your face
I'll twerk right in your face
Right in your face
Today I'm gonna throw it right in your face

I'm in
I'm ready to attack
When the bass hits, I'm going to bounce
On your face I will throw, ah-ah
And twerk, ah-ah

[Pre-Chorus: Pablo Vittar & Anitta]
I'm beautiful, free, light and loose
Craving to kiss some lips
Beautiful, free, light and loose
Craving to kiss some lips
Beautiful, free, light and loose
Craving to kiss some lips
Beautiful, free, light and loose
'Cause I'm gonna throw it right in your face

[Chorus: Anitta & Pabllo Vittar]
Right in your face
I'll twerk right in your face
Right in your face
Today I'm gonna throw it right in your face

[Bridge: Anitta]
You prepare for it, but you don't shoot (Right in your face)
You notice it, but you don't stare (Right in your face)
You think you're the man, but you don't stop me (Right in your face)
You think you're the man, but you don't stop me (Right in your face)
[Outro: Anitta & Pabllo Vittar]
If you don't come, I'll put pressure on you
I won't wait for you, I have plenty of options
I'm not the kind of woman to put up with preaching
Stare at me, get ready
'Cause I'm gonna throw it right in your face
