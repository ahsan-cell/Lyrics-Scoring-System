I'm calling out your name
The memories like Summer rain
I never want it to end
But as soon as I open my eyes you've left

[Verse 2]
I can still feel the sun on my skin
I know I've never had a love like this
Knowing that the words that you say
Let them all wash away

[Chorus]
What say you to the life we always wanted
What say you to reaching out with both your hands
What say you to jumping off the burning bridge
What say you, what say you, to giving us tonight the chance

What say you to the life we always wanted (what say you)
What say you to reaching out with both your hands (what say you)
What say you to jumping off the burning bridge (what say you)
What say you, what say you, to giving us tonight the chance (what say you)

(What say you)
(What say you)
(What say you)

Do you remember all the promises we made
I do, I do, and I still feel the same
And I already know to give it all away
So why you so why you staying
