When I look back to before
We were together
There was no pressure
No pain, just pleasure
We were young, you took my breath and
Filled your lungs up
I held my tongue in
Swept up all your poison

[Pre-Chorus: Becky Hill]
You get high, act like
I need rescuing
You're walking on thin ice
You don't realise

[Chorus: Becky Hill]
I'm alright tonight, live your life
You can keep that piece of me
I've come through, I'll prove, don't need you
It ain't how it used to be
You lost out, and now I've found
That I don't need that piece of me I've lost

(You can keep that piece of me, yeah)

Falling into emptiness
I've forgotten my mind
Faithless tears that I cried
I lost my whole life
Everything to live for now
I've shed my old skin
I thought I'd give in
But loving isn't losing

[Pre-Chorus: Becky Hill]
You get high, act like
I need rescuing
You're walking on thin ice
You don't realise

[Chorus: Becky Hill]
I'm alright tonight, live your life
You can keep that piece of me
I've come through, I'll prove, don't need you
It ain't how it used to be
You lost out, and now I've found
That I don't need that piece of me I've lost

(You can keep that piece of me, yeah)1
