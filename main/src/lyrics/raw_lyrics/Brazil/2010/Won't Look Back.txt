No one comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back

[Verse 1]
You make me wanna live forever
You're my remedy to yesterday
Now my struggle seems so far away
And life will never be the same

[Pre-Hook]
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side

[Hook]
Love comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back

I wish love was always this easy
But every now and then it brings us down
But I know that I can count on you
To keep the music playing on

[Pre-Hook]
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side
Living it up, living it up, living it up
Life ain't a party, your the passion by my side

[Hook]
Love comes close to you
Your love it makes me stronger
No matter what we're going through
I won't look back won't look won't look back
I won't look back won't look won't look back9
