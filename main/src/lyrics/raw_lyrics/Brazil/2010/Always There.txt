I'm coming out
Please play my jam
I like it loud

I'm smoking loud
Come take a puff
Don't say a word
If I let you fuck

Come to my bed
Boy fuck that couch
Ain't let you in
To kick you out

You know wassup
Don't kiss and tell
Let's fall in love
We might as well


I
Looooove
The way you
You hold me you kiss me
You console me I remember what you told me
You might also likeI
Loooove
The way you
Control me you use to be the homie
Now you want me now you want me


Do you love me or you love me not
I'm not a playa I crush a lot

I'm just kidding I be hittin all the spots that you like
Give me a second I'll be licking on ya spot by tonight

I know you from somewhere
You look just like my type
Girl I'll eat it like I ordered it twice

Strawberries and Ice
Got you cumming like you got a invite
Beat it up think it got in a fight

Pardon my pimpin I really just like women
All different colors just never no white women

Hahah I'm just serious
You know where to bring the kitty when you curious
Girl you finer than yo fine friend
Look at the time ain't gotta nigga sooo you mine then

Nah I'm just playing girl you know my style
I say anything to make you smile




Do you love me or you love me not
I'm not a playa I crush a lot

You hold a nigga and you hold ya own
I was crushing back when we was watching home alone

Now you blushing saying hit me when you home alone
Some chardonnay and Marvin Gaye
You know what's going on

Straight facts
I got ya hoodie saying GC now
Flower child
Got me smelling like tea tree now

Scratch away my doubts
When you rub a nigga scalp
Working on yo figure
Girl you got it figured out
Talking bout my dreams
Always there to hear me out
Was on the highway to hell
Switched seats and steer me out

You know the type of love you could never repay
I'm tryna see yo face like EVERYDAY

Nah I'm just playing girl you know my style
I say anything to make you smile


I
Looooove
The way you
You hold me you kiss me
You console me I remember what you told me

I
Loooove
The way you
Control me you use to be the homie
Now you want me now you want me
