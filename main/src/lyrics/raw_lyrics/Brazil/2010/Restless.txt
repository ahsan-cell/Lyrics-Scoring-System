We've been over, down before, but still we pulled it back
And nothing's ever come between us, not like this has
No, our love hasn't spoken for so long
And my head's telling my soul to move on
But I've resigned myself to being the one for you
So I just can't let go, I-

[Chorus]
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I-
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I-
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I-
I'd rather be, and I just can't let go, I-
Rather be, oh baby (rather be restless and I)
Rather be, I don't wanna leave (rather be restless and I)
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I-
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I

[Verse 2]
Back and forth and round in circles
Searching common ground (uh)
But love was not the problem
You know we're too proud (oh yeah)
But oceans, rivers, thunderstorms I cried
Time will pass just like our foolish pride
But I can't walk away, God know I tried
I know, this thing will pass in time so I
You might also like[Chorus]
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I (rather be)
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I (oh yeah)
Rather be, I'd rather be restless and I (I'd rather be)
I'd rather be (said I), I'd rather be
Do you feel me baby, feel me baby (I'd rather be restless)
Do you feel me baby, feel me baby (I'd rather be restless)
Oh, I'd rather be restless and I
Oh, I'd rather be, I'd rather be

[Chorus]
Said I, and I, said I, and I just can't let go, I
I'd rather be restless (x6)
I'd rather be
I'd rather be
I'd rather be restless (x7)
I'd rather be
I'd rather be restless (x4)
I'd rather be
I'd rather be restless (x2)
I'd rather be
And I just can't let go, I-

[Chorus]
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be restless
Rather be, I'd rather be
