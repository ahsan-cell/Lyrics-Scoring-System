I dey tell you my guy
You know my style
E no be jazz
Them dey sell am for eBay
If you say you get the mind
And you wanna try
You go go die iberibe
It's been a landslide for a long time
But them no wan believe me
All of una combined
Shey you wan try
Oya do am, if it easy
Who bad enough? Who do it like me? (Wait)
Make una phone my cellular, wait
Your back and your spinal cord e go break
If you carry my weight

[Chorus]
Because I'm way too big
Way too big to be fucking with you
To be fucking with you, mmm
Because I'm way too smart
Way too smart to be falling in your trap
Fucking with you, mmm
Because I'm way too cool
Way too cool to be losing my cool

Uh, truly, truly
I bring the thunder like Muri
They say I'm on drugs, ti mi o mu ri
But everything they talk say no dey do me
Them say na because me I be skuri
Before my life changed, I lived in a movie
Used to roll with the shank just like Julie
Still Popcaan 'cause I'm unruly
Beat my case 'cause of hung jury
Took my place as the shine shine bobo
Of the Nigerian brewery

[Chorus]
Because I'm way too big
Way too big to be fucking with you
To be fucking with you, mmm
Because I'm way too smart (Way too smart)
Way too smart to be falling in your trap
Fucking with you, mmm
Because I'm way too cool (Way too cool)
Way too cool to be losing my cool

[Bridge]
(Because I'm way too big)

You just mad because I'm poppin'

It's been a landslide for a long time
But them no wan believe me
All of una combined
Shey you wan try
Oya do am, if e easy
