I love I Love You....

[Verse 1]
Girl You know I had to go to war for a word for these words for You
If I have to put all my health in a purse it ain’t enough for You
Ain’t nobody know the cause of my matter o cause of my matter o is my Shawty
Anybody under estimating the matter o tell the man say him no know my shawty

[Pre-Chorus]
If You need a fire I’ll be lighter
Please be judge and put me on trial
If You think I’ll hot ya put me under water
Take me to court I don’t need a lawyer

[Chorus]
Cause I love, I love You
Can’t You see that I love, I love You
Can’t You see say I love, I love You
I love, I love You, I love, I love You
