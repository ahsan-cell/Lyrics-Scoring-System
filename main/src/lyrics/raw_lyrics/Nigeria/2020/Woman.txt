[Verse 1]
I'm in love with plenty women
I no mind marry all of them
E no matter the shape or colour
I go make sure say I must collect
I get one wey be my sponsor
I get one wey dey call me honey
One wey dey do me winchy, winchy
She dey do like Patience Ozokwor

[Pre-Chorus]
Wole, ka lo
Get in my room, make you lie down
Body dey move like a python
Love wey dey give me iron
Wole, ka lo
After the room to the parlor
Then make you pose for my Canon
Love wey dey boost my iro-o-on

[Chorus]
I too like woman, I too like woman
Me I no dey gboran, me I no dey gboran
I too like woman, I too like woman
Me I no dey gboran, me I no dey gboran

[Verse 2]
Too many girls in my DM

Plenty wey dey wey go concur, oh-oh

Enter the room gimme me your phone
Make them no go see me for blog

Then make you pose for my canon
Love wey dey boost my iro-o-on

I too like woman, I too like woman
Me I no dey gboran, me I no dey gboran
I too like woman, I too like woman
Me I no dey gboran, me I no dey gboran

Is it too much to ask?
I too like woman, woman6
