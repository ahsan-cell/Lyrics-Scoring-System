No other, she be the one she

I'm telling all my boys am on your side
I’m counting all your loss on my side
Coz you be my Nikka

You be my water
You be my blood
You be my river
You be my road
You be my fever
You be my cold

With ten toes
She carry my matter
Like dandruff
When things scatter
She dey hang on
When thing better
She dey thank God
