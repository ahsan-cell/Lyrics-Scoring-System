I see this maga, last December
He wan come closer, I say what is the matter?
He say na soldier, say he go fire If I no give am number
He want to be my lover
I say "Your father", I repeat am "Your father"
Oh see me see wahala, I don enter yawa
Oh oh
I tell my mama, my mama tell my papa
She say "See me see wahala"

[Chorus: Simi]
Soldier go, soldier come, soldier do wetin you want
But don’t fall in love with me
Soldier go, soldier come, soldier do wetin you want
But don’t fall in love with me

[Verse 1: Falz]
Oya stand at attention
I'm talking to you, you are respond
Emi okunrin mesan, how can you be asking me question?
You no dey look face so?
It's like you don’t know my name, no?
Mo fe ka ma date though
Eyi to pe ni boyfriend o le to, na me say so
See I stand I balance (You stand you balance)
Because I'm a chief lieutenant (I cannot be your servant)
You no see my car, it's German
You no see the swag, gallant
See many dey claim my madam
But I no know these babes from Adam
They just want to follow the ladder
They know that nobody is badder
She say "Why him dey flex like here be gym?"
"Make he dey hope dey there dey dream"
"Is it by force to be with him? Is this a military regime?"
I be soldier man, I say stand at ease
Sho ri dollar, ma fi gba e l'eti
It's only me, there is no competi
I’ll make it rain like it's confetti
Sho mo Paris? Sho ti lo be ri? (No)
I will take you and your ebi (Oh)
No mess up, na wahala
I'm a Hitler, I'm Abacha
You better respect, I dey run the town
Even Darego no fit turn me down
See weapon wey you carry
Come and be general in my army
Mummy

Soldier go, soldier come, soldier do wetin you want
But don’t fall in love with me
Soldier go, soldier come, soldier do wetin you want
But don’t, don't you fall in love with me

[Verse 2: Simi & Falz]
Mr Soldier
Me I dey wonder
Shey is it by force, you dey form superpower
Yeah I'm super, I get power
Wa gba paper, wa fi shower (Mo ti shower)
I get babes the age of your mama
So just stop am, this your drama
See this man, I say "Your father"
Oya oya repeat am - "Your father"
Oh see me see wahala
I don enter yawa oh oh
Oh yes, na yawa wey you enter, it's a one chance
I tell you no man overthrow man from this romance
Only coup d'etat

[Outro: Simi]
Soldier go, soldier come
Soldier do wetin you want
But don’t fall in love with me
Soldier me I no dey do
Soldier find another boo, just don’t fall in love me
Soldier me I no dey do
Soldier me I no dey do, so don’t you fall in love
Mo ni don’t you fall in love with me, with me
Don’t you fall in love, don’t you fall in love
