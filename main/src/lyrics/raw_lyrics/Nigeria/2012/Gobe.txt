Girl your behind is a killer
I can see you sensual, see gobe, omo see gobe
The way you wriggle and waver you must be intentional, see gobe, omo see gobe


[Pre-Chorus]
Mo gbe oh
Don’t want any gbege oh
Mo ti bo sinu gobe

Baby, I can tell your every action is a plot to
Get down with this bobo
‘Cause I know you feeling the boy

See gobe, omo see gobe
See gobe, omo see gobe
See gobe, omo see gobe
See me see gbege, e wa ba mi ri gobe


[Verse 2]
Girl I love the way you look tonight
I wanna put my hands on your waist
‘Cause I’m loving your sexy body
Won’t mind to have a taste
Dey feel like hanging over
Dey roll like jangilova
Good things come to those who wait
So I’m ready to sleep outside you gate
