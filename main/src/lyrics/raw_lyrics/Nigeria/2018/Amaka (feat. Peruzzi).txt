Accord, if I talk you pour me holy water
Accord, if I talk you-
(Speroach Beatz)

[Verse 1: 2Baba]
I like woman, I dey straight forward
I like truth and I dey rock rumours eh
I don't know wetin you want to do
But make you let me know if you go show up eh
Because I don buy diesel
I don buy shayo for yard o
I don call Gaaga, I don call my guys around o
I don call my mama, I tell am say you bam o
I don call everybody, I call everybody
But I see you for Insta
You say you dey Ipaja
And anytime I holla, you go say you dey my area
I say no wahala but I don dey wait you tire

[Chorus: 2Baba]
Amaka disappoint me
O tiyeneke confusion
Amaka disappoint me
Nyom kem disappointment o
Amaka disappoint me
Nyom kem confusion
Amaka disappoint me
O tiyeneke disappointment o
