If I lose it all will you still be there for me?
If I no get money o will you still be loving me?
If you knew my weakness would you stand by me?
Ti won ba n ba mi je o, so ma s'egbe leyin mi?
So promise me, you’ll grow old with me
And ride with me, till the sun goes down
So promise me, you'll grow old with me
And ride with me, till the sun goes down

[Verse 2: Simi]
Baby when you're cold o I can be your fire
My love na forever, I no go fit retire
If I call your name baby mi will you answer
I will answer you baby baby
Mofe bimo meji will you be the father?
I will be your lover
Promise me you will grow old with me
And ride with me, till the sun goes down
Promise me, you’ll grow old with me
And ride with me, till the sun goes down

[Outro: Adekunle & Simi]
I promise you I will never give up on us
And I'll ride with you till one hundred and forty fourYou might also like
