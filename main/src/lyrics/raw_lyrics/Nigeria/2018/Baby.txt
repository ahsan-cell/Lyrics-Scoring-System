[Verse 2]
What you wanna do girl
Where you wan go
'Cos anywhere you go, girl
I go follow go
Cos I like the way you back it up
The way you go down low
And that's the reason they be hating on you, who are those?
Baby you the baddest
Step on the dance floor and show your madness
I will be your king
You will be my royal highness
Out of all the girl them you are the flyest
[Refrain]
Baby shey u dey for me
As I dey for you
Baby shey you dey for me
As I dey for you
