Holy father
Holy father I’m screaming
My lady gaga
She got me in my feelings
I be Adam for this garden of Eden
Holy father my holy father

My lady gaga
She got me in my feelings
I be Adam for this garden of Eden
Holy father my holy father

On my mark o
I’m running back to you
I’m running tracks o
I’m running mad for you
Give me your map
I’m running back to you
Keep breaking my heart o
Till I run out of heart o
On my mark o
I’m running back to you
I’m running tracks o
I’m running mad for you
Give me your map
I’m running back to you
Keep breaking my heart o
Till I run out of heart o

I can't face it all alone
This shit is detrimental
To my body and my soul
Don’t wanna lose all the things we once had
Fuck all my fronting
I still want you back
(Hey) Can I havе your number
(Hey) Can I give you a call
(Hеy) We are not getting younger
(Hey) So tonight let us try it all
Chew up spit me out
Make me stand on my feet
I surrender to thee
Do what you want with me

[Chorus: Victony]
Holy father Holy father I’m screaming
My lady gaga
She got me in my feelings
I be Adam for this garden of Eden
Holy father my holy father
Holy father Holy father I’m screaming
My lady gaga
She got me in my feelings
I be Adam for this garden of Eden
Holy father my holy father
[Outro: Victony]
