Vibez
But you knew that
It's Ladipoe

[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1: Ladipoe]
Way out my feelings and nothing can stress me
The way I run the game I'm feeling like referee
No like Moses parting the red sea
Like a chaffeur, me in the back of Bentley
So I step out all white can’t stain
What you want? Rosè? Champagne?
I got that, big bag, back pain
Taking the piss, the only time I can't aim
So we toast to the good life
Living every minute to the full cause I could die
Pull up at the spot open doors and it's suicide
Chilling rent free
Where the check please? Couple hundred Gs on a good night
You might also like[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
No oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: Ladipoe]
All I wanna do is jaiye
220 on a highway
I'm about the energy
Baby if it's good send it my way
If it's bad keep it private
All this haters so vexed I'm the best alive
You don’t want test the guy
You be sleeping on yourselves you tse tse fly
Throw myself a party then act surprised
And be the highest in the room when the guest arrive yeah
Ain't nobody realer, touch down, got a couple Gs for the dealer
Gang signs out the window my killah
Life getting sweeter no use water dilute my Ribena
So we toast to the good life
Every minute to the full cause we could die
Pull up open doors and it's suicide
16 bad woop and they all by the poolside
[Chorus: Buju]
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
No oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh

[Outro: Buju]
With them boys, enough toys
Wey dey make noise, enough choice
You gats fear when you see boys
Wey dey roll up in the nice toys
I like the way I'm feeling now
No come use your reggae
Spoil my blues and rhythm now
Oh oh oh oh
I like the way I'm feeling now
Omo e get small thing wey dey stress me
But right now I'm chilling now
Oh oh oh oh1
