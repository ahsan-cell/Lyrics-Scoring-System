Ooba

[Verse 1]
Loving you be my greatest sin
Said I was done but see I'm here
You don't make it easy rara
To stay away from yawa

[Chorus]
Sheba, oh, Sheba
Girl, you make me a sinner
Sheba, oh, Sheba
No make me pull the trigger
Never say never
Know I can do whatever
For Sheba, oh, be mine
Don't wanna be a sore loser, no

[Verse 2]
Drunk on your potion
Can feel my lips burning
Losing composure
Can feel my face drowning
Seems so irrational
Ready to risk it all
If I can't have you, nobody can (No, no)
Tell me how can I get my mind off you (Oh, Sheba)
I cannot take my hands off you
Tell me how, I cannot gеt my eyes off you, oh (Yeah-yеah)

Sheba, oh, Sheba
Girl, you make me a sinner
Sheba, oh, Sheba
No make me pull the trigger
Never say never
Know I can do whatever
For Sheba, oh, be mine
Don't wanna be a sore loser, no

[Bridge]
You're such a rush
My baby, slow down, come find your love
I'm hoping you see me
Come serve it up
Love it when you stir it up (Stir it up)
That body belong on TV
Ooh, this feeling I can't hide
You feeling up my mind
And I just don't know why (I just don't know why)

[Chorus]
Sheba, oh, Sheba
Girl, you make me a sinner
Sheba, oh, Sheba
No make me pull the trigger
Never say never
Know I can do whatever
For Sheba, oh, be mine
Don't wanna be a sore loser, no
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
No
