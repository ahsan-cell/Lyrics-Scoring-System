Yeah, yeah
My sex exhale is the only air that she breathe
And when I look into her eyes, I know that she can never get enough of me
Your body high me like lean

And as the rush dey increasе

She grabbed my neck and she whisper, "Please"
Shawty give me dirty splash from my chest to my knees

Sweet baby melanin sweeter than sugarcane

Tapping on her pussy like I'm tryna kill a motherfucking insect
