[Chorus: Rema]
When the beat drops all the girls wanna sing along
Me ah go dey give them di vibe 'til the kingdom come
The place where I come from be another dimension
Nobody been look my face when I dey on my own
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my bruddas dey, wey deh serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight

[Verse 1: Skepta & Rema]
Man it's gettin' ugly, still I look for the beauty
Girls sellin' the coochie for the Gucci
All I see is good girls tryna show love
Same time all these groupies actin' bougie
I came in the game like, "Yo, excuse me"
Shout out my OG's and shout out my juvies
Get robbed for your carti, with the little Uzi
Bruddas shootin' clips like an action movie (On God)
And I know it seems stupid (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
But bruddas ain't seen no love, they need cupid
Even though we're winnin', we still sinnin'
And this ain't gonna change overnight, it's deep-rooted (Oh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Flashbacks of dead bodies and gunshots
Last time I see my brudda's face was a mugshot
PTSD will leave permanent scars
Can't lie, man, I ain't the same brudda that I once was (Oh, ooh-woah)

When the beat drops all the girls wanna sing along
Me ah go dey give them di vibe 'til the kingdom come
The place where I come from be another dimension
Nobody been look my face when I dey on my own
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my bruddas dey, wey dey serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight

[Verse 2: Skepta]
I was taught to listen to my elders
I can hear the yutes cry, I'm feelin' so helpless
Open up my third eye, I'm feelin' so selfless
It's the same old story, different occasion
Nigerian, Ghanaian, Jamaican
Ugandan, Congolese and the Bajan
You can be a star or you can end up a patient
Gotta mind how you step, blood on the pavement

[Bridge: Rema]
Bad man, don't threaten me
You no fit kill, who don die before
Oh, Father forgive me, my sins
I reminisce all the things I've done wrong
Oh, please put me under your wings
I still dey pray, make my mandem live long
'Cause many wan' quench the fire
Jah love gon' take us higher
[Chorus: Rema]
When the beat drops all the girls wanna sing along
Me ah go dey give them di vibe 'til the kingdom come (Ooh-ooh)
The place where I come from be another dimension
Nobody been look my face when I dey on my own
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my bruddas dey, wey dey serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight

[Post-Chorus: Rema]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
I been on the road for a long time
Tryna get the bread so my family go survive
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Some of my brothers dey, wey dey serve time
They wanna be free, they all wanna see the sunlight

[Outro: Rema]
Anytime I enter, call 911
Me I get the flow wey dey cause fire
Why they hate on me 'cause I'm rich and young
Watch me unchained while I watch you burn
No man can take my place
Forever and ever my music shining, ah-ha
That's what I got to say to y'all
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah3
