May your struggles keep you near the cross
And may your troubles show that you need God
And may your battles end the way they should
And may your bad days prove that God is good
And may your whole life prove that God is good

See, may your struggles keep you near the cross
And may your troubles show that you need God
And may your battles end the way they should
And may your bad days prove that God is good
See, may your whole life prove that God is good

May your struggles keep you near the cross
And may your troubles show that you need God
And may your battles end the way they should
And may your bad days prove that God is good
See, let your whole life prove that God is good

[Interlude]
Thank you all so much for coming out

[Outro]
May your bad days prove that God is good
May your whole life prove that God is good
See, may your bad days prove that God is good
May your whole life prove that God is good1
