[Spoken Word]
You need to know that every man that is made
He has built on a ritual
And that ritual is called the Place of Prayer
You don't need to have a good voice
Just go there
Even when your strength is failing
You press on again
When you feel weak, you pray again
When your strength is losing
You enter into the groaning
But make sure you don't stop
Or else, Satan will make mess of you

[Chorus]
I will pray, I will pray
I will pray, oh, I will pray
If I don't pray, Satan will make mess of me
