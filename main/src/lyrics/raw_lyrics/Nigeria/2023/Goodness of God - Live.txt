I love You, Lord
For Your mercy never fails me
All my days
I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up
Until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

[Chorus]
'Cause all my life you have been faithful
And all my life you have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

[Verse 2]
I love Your voice
You have lead me through the fire
In darkest nights
You are close like no other
I've known You as a Father
I've known You as a Friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God (Hey)

[Chorus]
'Cause all my life you have been faithful (Oh, yes, you have)
And all my life you have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

Is running after me
Your goodness is running after (Oh, yeah)
It's running after me (Oh, yeah)
Your goodness is running after
Is running after me
With my life laid down, I surrender now
I give You everything (Everything)
Your goodness is running after
Is running after me

And all my life you have been faithful, mm-mm
And all my life you have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able

All my life you have been so, so good (So good, with every breath)
