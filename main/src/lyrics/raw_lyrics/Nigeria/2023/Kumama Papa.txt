[Chorus]
Joy can be hard to come by
So, let's make this Christmas one to remember
Let's celebrate this new life
'Cause love's here and here to stay!
Bells will be ringing, children are singing
They're singing, oh-oh-oh-oh
Joy, can you feel it now?
'Cause love came on Christmas day

[Post-Chorus]
So we keep singing
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
So we keep singing
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
