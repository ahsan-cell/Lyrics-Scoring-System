Olololololouh

You are feeling fly
Cause I no get kpa
You dey follow sugar daddies
To dey do jati jati eh eh eh
I dey wonder why
Baby do me like this o
You can do me like that o

Be loyal, be humble (popo ne)
No money na trouble
Oh baby no fumble (Nepo)
I love you, she no do
Na money dey open (Gbe body eh)
I'm feeling your hustle
With everything you do
Yea

At the end of the day
You know I love you
Nobody fine pass you
