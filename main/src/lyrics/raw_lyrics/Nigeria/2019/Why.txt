Hey! Yeah! Hey!
Skrrrr! (I love you) Skrrrr!

[Pre-Chorus]
With my heart and my soul I look in your eyes
And the way that I feel girl I can't deny
With my gang and my dawgs we live in the wild
Girl I send a lotta texts buh you don’t reply

[Chorus]
Why? (Yahy)
I just wonder why, I just wonder why
And I travelled miles
Damn girl you know I travelled miles
I want you in my life, girl I want you in my life
Even if it's for a little while
I wanna see you smile, girl I wanna see you smile
See you smile (Yah), For a while (Yah)
Can you try (Yah), Hold you tight (Yaahy)

[Verse]
Ay! I said Hi! (Ay)
She said ‘who you is?' (Ay)
I said Remmy boy (Ooh)
She said we don’t fit (Ay)
Girl, gimme a chance (Ay)
Cuz of that I'd burst up the ground (Ay)

She be like what do you do (Yeah)
You ain't got no cash (Ay)
You look so so razz (Ay)
I am not your type (Ay)
Damn I almost cried (Ay)
I know you are hard to get and I'm not the one
I know you would find me when I'm moving on
Maybe cuz I had no cash and I wasn't cool
And you treated me so bad, I felt like a fool
Why? (Yahy)
I wish you was mine, I wish you was mine, I wish you was mine
