It was Colorado
I know
Rocky number 5 yo
So cold
Oops that was a typo
So so
Took me for a ride though
High low
I was not in my right mind
No no
I was moving so slow
Slow mo
Just wanted to go go
Fo sho
Just wanted to fly like
Spyro

Kept getting shut down
From the ISO
Now I'm deep in my chair
With the lights low
Trying to make it so they hear all the right flows
But the the truth is I fear where it might go
So I'm keeping both ears open
Eyes closed
And I'm praying to God to save my soul
And put down these stupid idols
Rather have my hands clutch bibles
You might also likeCause the blood of the lamb is vital
And it's straight rolling in like tidal
(Waves)
Having all the tools is cool
It rules
But I'm just a fool if I don't use them
I pocket them all them all like pool
My pool is huge
Can't fit them all in two cents
Hope that it fits
I'm just put the beat and lyrics together like cold fusion

Lookin at this life through a whole new lens
Fresh new gear
No more old loose ends
True vine
New wine
New wineskins
I yelled at Satan
Hadoken
But why I does he win
Why do I sin
I feel like that crap when the bottles fin
I might crack like a hollow chin
Always looking back where I've just been
Like
I was just there
I don't why I have to keep doing all this stuff over and over again
I guess it's okay if I hit a brick wall
Since
I'm so hardheaded

[Bridge]
Can't help it
So hardheaded
I can't help it
So hardheaded
So hardheaded
Stiff necked
So hardheaded

And if I
Fall from grace
Then I will just pray to God
With all my
Faith
In the Lord
I'll keep him deep in my heart
For all my
Days
[Chorus]
Man I don't really care what they say
I'm a praise the Lord everyday
I will abide in him
And that's where I'll stay
And just let the chips
Fall Where they may

Man I don't really care what they say
I'm a praise the Lord everyday
I will abide in him
And that's where I'll stay
And just let the chips
Fall Where they may
Okay

So hardheaded
Stiff necked
So hardheaded
Can't help it
So hardheaded
Stiff necked
So hardheaded

[Outro]

(He is in control)
E e ni kare wa ai suru
(Yeah, I'll meet you)
Anata to watashi
(You and me)
