Yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Yeah, touch down oso ga eme
They know that I'm not one of them
Odogwu looking like a million bucks
Clean like a religious song
Alhamdulilah, in God I trust
Heard them for the street dem dey corner talk
No be chyce na kolanut
Me I no dey gree like Donald Trump
Makinde
Solo makinde
General solo makinde
Different style we dey use slap them face
U know my style na follow come
And I no go lie I dey kolo small
And you talk, say I no show love
Do I look like I give a fuck?

[Chorus: Phyno & Burna Boy]

I don't give a shot obata osu
