I spend my nights atop the hill
All this drank in my cup I can't let spill
I gotta niggas talking down, we cannot chill
I'm forever in the cut, fuck how you feel
Lil shawty wanna fuck me when I come around, yeah
I heard niggas hate me cause I'm thumbing now, yeah
I heard niggas out here tryna hunt me down, yeah
Can't be out here slipping, I keep gun around
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Niggas hate me cause they hurting
I don't never see them working
They be way too busy lurking
I can feel the tables turning
I done came up and I earned it
I need all my cottons persian
Moms need Louis on her purses
So ima whip it till it's perfect
Whip game too crucial
Switch lanes, no uber
Kick game taijutsu
No beef, stay neutral
Break bread, stay moving
My squad stay truthful
My grind stay useful
You wish I knew you
You was wishing I go poor hoe
But you the one came up short though
God got me he support bro
I meditate to keep the form bro
Life's a bitch, I'll make a porno
Fuck the world, it give me oral
Keep the dough like digiorno
I gotta get it nigga, lord knows
You might also like[Chorus]
I spent my nights atop of hill
All this drank in my cup I can't let spill
I gotta niggas talking down we cannot chill
I'm forever in the cut fuck how you feel
Lil shorty wanna fuck me when I come around, yeah
I heard niggas hate me cause I'm thumbing now, yeah
I heard niggas out here tryna hunt me down, yeah
Can't be out here slipping I keep gun around
Yeah

[Verse 2]
Can't let shit temp me
Success brings envy
Niggas too iffy
Can't let them get me
That draco sing like Whitney
I lay low, keep it with me
That pay load 5 50
I stay gone off henny
She gone get wet when I touch it
She mix the blue Fanta with henny, we fucking
These boys want a verse but they don't got no money
I'm sorry lil nigga, that's not for discussion
I spend my nights on the hill, fuck the public
I got nobody in my corner so fuck it
All you niggas gone be coroner luggage
I need shit you can't afford in my luggage
I need foreign after foreign so 4 in the morning
I can ride out with the foreign
She doing something that's foreign
I'm tryna kick all the doors to foreign endorsements
I need a check
We in the hills
Straight out the met
She fucking with me
Girl that's a flex
She just want sex
Don't call up my phone
Just leave me a text
[Chorus]
I spent my nights atop of hill
All this drank in my cup I can't let spill
I gotta niggas talking down we cannot chill
I'm forever in the cut fuck how you feel
Lil shorty wanna fuck me when I come around, yeah
I heard niggas hate me cause I'm thumbing now, yeah
I heard niggas out here tryna hunt me down, yeah
Can't be out here slipping, I keep gun around
Yeah

[Verse 3]
I hit a lick then the highway
Nobody trusted in my way
They want me to stop the life I made
The army or college, decline weight
My father had told me that I'm not a normal kid
I had to get back on track, hit the road and shit
I dropped Above Me when people start noticing
Boy got a gift
He won't let you control the shit
Haters I did what I promised
They girlfriends all calling me father
She act like she love you
She won't even fuck you
Somebody please get her an Oscar
I remember I was selling perkys, yeah
Now I make money off verses, yeah
I'm not off the lean but I'm swerving, yeah
Bet I'll shoot if you making me nervous, yeah
So please don't take me for a joke
Cause you can scoop in all the smoke
I got shooters that's on go
Nory he really on go
Trigga he really on go
They be my bloodas my bros
I got this bitch on the road
I made a check shadow clone
That's why
[Outro]
I spent my nights atop of hill
All this drank in my cup I can't let spill
