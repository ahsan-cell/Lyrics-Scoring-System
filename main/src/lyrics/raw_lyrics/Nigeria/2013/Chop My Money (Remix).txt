[Verse 1: Akon]
First of all you are the type of woman that stays on my mind
Walk down the street, every guy wanna jump on your behind
It's your seduction that makes sure that we stay in line
Sexual corruption 'cause I’ll kill anyone for your time
(Ti-i-ime, ti-i-ime, yeah)
Even though I make real dough, you're the reason there’ll be more yeah
(Ti-i-ime, ti-i-ime, yeah)
Even though I got much more, I don’t mind if you

[Chorus: Akon]
Chop my money, chop my money
Chop my money, cuz I don’t care
Chop my money, chop my money
Chop my money, cuz I don’t care
I don’t care (don’t care)
I don’t care (don’t care)

Cuz I get am plenty
I don’t care (don’t care)
