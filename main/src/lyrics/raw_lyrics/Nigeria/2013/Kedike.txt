[Verse 1: Chidinma]
From the first time I met you
There was something about you
I can never forget the way you take thief my heart
I dey try to pretend you
I no like, I no send you
But I know like we're friends too
'Cause you gave me a spark
I just can't help myself
I wan be your all
And I see no one else
Wey I fit give my heart


[Pre-Chorus: Chidinma]
I no go ever leave you
I go dey there for you
Nothing wey them fit do
To take me away from you
I no go ever leave you
I go dey there for you oh
Nothing wey them fit do
To take me away

[Verse 2: Chidinma]
I can tell what's that to
Build my whole world around you
No one else can do the things that you do for me
I wanna be there for you
Baby I really love you
There is something about you that I cannot explain
Na you alone I want
And you alone I need
And you alone go make me feel complete
I just can't help myself
