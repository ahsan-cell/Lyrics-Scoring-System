Like a little kid
The sun comes running through my window
And I feel, again I feel
Like a little kid, yeah
Like a little kid, yeah
Like a little kid, yeah
Like a little kid, yeah
First forwards and then backwards
My life comes running through my system
And I feel, again I feel
Like I barely made it
Like I’m God’s favorite
Like I barely made it
Like I’m God’s favorite

[Verse 1]
Scars what I’m given
Why you make life so hard God, don’t you know how we’re living?
So now it’s scars that I’m giving
Don’t act hard, fraud
I know you how you living
My eyes keep tearing
No one can tell
Got a lead suit I’m wearing
Dumb wearing
Done wearing
Eyelids closed
Still I’m staring
I live closed
Never caring a trait I taught myself when no one was there and
I looked up and saw no where
I know, I know, I know
It’s so hard to let it go when all you want to do
Is let your feelings blow
But you can’t
And they stuck
Fuck you bitch this ain’t a rant
This is my voice and not no motherfucking front
Better listen up
Better listen down
Better listen all around
The truth
Gives no fuck about direction
Sorry and I can’t respect no lessons
That I ain’t learnt on my own
Used to it and still I sit outside my home
Imagining where all my days have gone
I’m used to it, but still I’m alone
I promised I give thanks for the day
But it’s been so long I forgot how to pray
I promised I give thanks for the day
But its been so long I don’t know what to say

[Verse 2]
Hoes wanna talk, but I look too mean
Popos wanna stalk, cuz my whip too clean
And you can’t relate
But that does not mean that this shit is fake
Hate to alienate
But try and move yourself into me
Into one
Then you’ll see
Then I’ll see
Then we can relate and be
Something more
Something whole
The whole world is sucking my soul
I’m tired of clenching my fists until my knuckles are cold
Set the record flat
Set the record straight
This hate ain’t fake, it’s got a long fuse
It’s these smiles that demonstrate my Tom Cruise
Possibilities
I’ve missed them
Entirely
So possibly
I’m gone dude this time has felt so long
Fuck you, substance what you wanted, huh?
Now I’ve spelled it out
Like Speak & Spell
Funny hell
How y’all looking like now
Y’all ain’t feeling too well
Well, well, never dwell
That’s about all I can tell, I’m out
Watch me set my sail, I’m out
You can have this jail
I promised I give thanks for the day
But it’s been so long I forgot how to pray
I promised I give thanks for the day
But its been so long I don’t know what to say
[Hook]
