What happen to the rap game is really a shame everybody front like they illy and bang
Attention whores, crap fame, silly and lame they industry snakes with a reptilian gang
Clout chasers never been the willy with the reign I beat em till they purple get Ceily with the pain
I’m hot dog but I’m chilly with the aim when I scope your mouth wash it guilly your brain
Take ya top off drop it if you pop shit and the message of love you not with
This world had been done got sick from nonsense but it’s more to life than the concept
To see what you can gain when you rap it became a flip like the game of the trap
Making sure we remain in a trap but they might go insane with the fact
That the black man gotta do what the black man can do stay lit like a candle
With a black queen thick as bamboo down to catch a lick when it’s on the paper like bamboo
Cause I gotta put the money in the pocket of the people just so way we got another away to block up off all the evil
Man I hate seeing drug fiend families who in love with deep taste of the rock or the needle
And no perks for jerks if they acts and words don’t put in the work for the work of Kool Herc
Cause then I see you as a systematic plan to destroy the black man and hurt our worth
I’m black Rambo to the uncle Tom Sambo who happen to serve Saxon and rep Anglo
While I stand code blam foes with the Bruce Leeroy hand glow

I'm the man of this shit like I ran through the strips put a gun in your mouth and expanded yo lips
Put my man on your chips take the band off your wrist my hand on your chick she a fan of the cliques
Got a couple homies in my rap group, fuck around the beat makers might clap you
Keep calm better learn how to act fool, go nuts be casualty after cashew
You’ll be living on the run like a hoe on the track, pray to God that we never ever catch you
Still we do what we have to mash you, treat you like dope in poverty we trap you
I loss friends, who I knew in the very beginning, funny how's ends had became the ending
But fuck that baby I just keep on living cause Jordan still Jordan without Pippin
Still tend to do my thug thizzle ain’t trying to move from where the slugs drizzle
I’m trying to make a change so they don’t hit you, and solve every damn mother fucking drug issue
Told you in the first verse how the drug shit hurts, this os more deep than church with both foot in
Talking ‘bout the work we got put in, cause you know faith without work get you nothing
I use the power Yahweh allowed us to push mountains boundless and countless hours
The riches surrounding round us, ain’t yours, don’t be counting ours
This for the people who go through it, got to spirit bomb the hate and Goku it
Take all the energy don’t roll through it, let your inner g make your soul do it

Well dat one dedicate all original bad man, bad gal mc dem
Weh come fi mitigate all di digital carbon copy weh pretend
Watch them assimilate wit the fictional
And guan like dem ah di baddest men
But the whole ah dem ah bait, mi nuh business
Cause dem can’t fuck wit the pen
Yo wah do unnu man?

Then chat bout them ah di truth
But ah just one bag ah lie
When dem get inna di booth
Bout inna di car
And inna di gal
A movie to wha
A shoo by do buah

Wait as a mattafact see dat cliff deh, guan go to the edge, chuck off
Go tell di ground, Konnichiwa
Lava deyah pon di riddim wit a heater
Right off ah di block where niggas blast the heaters
Nigga you could die over a bag of cheeba and it Annuh nothin either
So it go inna di meaner, side of town weh cold like liquid nitrogen
I take it and I turned it to a homicidal, flow dem could a never see no John Cena but a fi di vanentine
Lyrical LSD when a Knizza come thru wit di Redddafyah
When we come thru, Haffi lock down di place and make them pussy-hole artist fi retire
Brooklyn 718, do it for the bad man and bad gal straight
We nuh really care how di whole ah dem a hate
Cause yuh dun know seh di whole ah we great, come now
