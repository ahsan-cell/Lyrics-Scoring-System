This talent is a gift so flex be ninety ex steps one by faith love is sure fire way
Rap is for all sincerity if you take are lives take up your cross using your life is not in vain
The beast will be unleashed in the streets carry on with the trance in advance
Swith to the blade I got it made in the shade as for substance a mouse in a cage
What's the latest rage so behave go cause to be conditioned in my own intuition
Jesus is for us each one to behold doesn't stuff you in some mold
Let the truth be told suckas want to be my friend hopes to depend
Flying flames let me be the first to explain Im still in the game

Got me locked in my cell as I live out my living hell flirting with fire down to the wire
Gonna take it higher burning with its fullest of desire gotta keep it straight
Call it fate as we live to contemplate with faith like a switch blade better act your age
Falling down on my knees listening to the fathers gentle voice with a choice to rejoice
Christ is on his throne so I'll never be alone caged away like a rat in its cell
I heard the wedding bell whisper through the gentle breezeYou might also like
