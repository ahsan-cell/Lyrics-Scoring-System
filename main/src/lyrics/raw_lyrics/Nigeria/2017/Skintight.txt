A commonly known disease found amongst Ghanaian Stars
Cursed to never shine beyond their borders like the National football team
As black stars, your light must remain pro dark
Cos when in Rome, act like Romans

Bring back the days of VIP and 2Face
Somebody Bring back the days of R2Bees and Wande
We used to have love, can’t believe Ghanaians conducted a press conference just to ban Nigerian songs

You were suppose to conquer the world with the Hiplife genre
But you’ve consumed yourselves with hate and bitterness
You got Bitter to a point where your largest Exports, Wey be Cocoa got replaced by Kasaprenko

This is chess I’m aiming at the Queen Mother
If you’re the king, it means there’s bigger fish to fry
Joe the Pawn, defends your Honour? the King’s Joe-ker
Sarko-die, so it’s certain that the King goes down

You pretend everyday that you love your heritage
We see through the Lingerie, Ghana bitches hate themselves
But Before I school you far and wide, you ignoramuses
First I’ll school you on your land, like Michael Blackson

Hiplife was pioneered by Reggie Rock stone
Your people jinxed it, when You should be embracing your own
Stop trying to be on top the American genre
Bros you don cast, your husband confirmed you be bottom, Joey
Respect your Partner, Mr Sarko
Best rapper in Africa is like a Highschool Social prefect title
An Afrobeats god will never downgrade to a king status
Charlie, Why are you so Obsessed with Afrobeats downfall
You might also likeAfrobeats is so big, she’s adopting babies
And by your standards, is Chris Brown the newest Afrobeats slay queen?
Cos all we do is murder weak links
You be weightless Kunta Kinte, hanging by Obidi’s G-string

Tiwa, is what an Afrobeats slayqueen look like
Ayra, is what an Afrobeats slayqueen look like
But Delusional Joe dey call him fellow man, woman
We no dey discriminate against LJBTQ man

Yemi A, is what an Afrobeats slayqueen look like
Niniola is what an afrobeats slayqueen look like
But Delusional Joe dey look him fellow man like woman
We no dey discriminate against LJBTQ man

And Thats Lesbians, Joes, Bisexuals, Trans and Queers
Equality for all, like the Okoyes we are squared
You’re the type that’ll call a Carter Efe, Carter Ify
Sister
You should be French kissing him, so you can spit better, you dry fuck
If the rap game was porn, you dry hump
You’re dryer than your Mothers’ tongue
I’ma let your mothers tongue lick the arc of this prick
Cos Your accent is your archilles heel
The only Trojan horse here is the prophylactics On my genital warfare
Your accent was God sent with lack of T-fare
It sounds like there was a long trek before it reached your Ghanaian doorsteps
Tired coffees, racially flavored dysfunctional black, and it’s not fair
I’m not here to diss Sarkodie
I’m here for Hip-hop’s growth, sell the market
I’m serving warning shots, tell Ghanaian rappers please drink responsibly
Easy Afrobeats groupie, I know you’re a pained fan
Won’t be Eazi next time, skin tight when I Efya
I got a question for your football team
If stars were made to be bright
How does a black star intend to shine?

Ehhh, NEPA
Nepa don take light
So this is what it feels like to be a Ghanaian Black Star
Dear Ghanaian brothers, you are not alone

Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
Sarkodie
Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
Lyrical Joe
Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
Is what an Afrobeats Groupie look like
