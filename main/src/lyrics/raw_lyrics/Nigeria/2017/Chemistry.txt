Everybody seems too think that we'll be good together oh
Everybody don dey talk say make you be my lover oh
But they don’t need to know if am your spec oh
I don’t need to know if I take your breathe away
You don’t need to know my wildest dreams
Maybe it is all just chemistry

[Chorus]
But I know oh ah
Kind of maybe really do like you
Maybe me and you we can try to
Do this love something
Maybe there’s something there
(I know there’s something)
And I know you
Kind of may be really do like me
Maybe I could be your baby
We should stop fronting
Maybe there’s something there
(I know there’s something)

[Verse 2: Falz]
Bae I know say you like me
Your heart skips anytime I say nice things
May be we dey shy since
May be faith don say we can’t fight this
You dey draw me, you be fine artiste
We don push maybe we should try practice
We could go slow like say we jam traffic
If them won talk sh*t make we buy harpic
When you step right to my door
I dey wish I could hug that pinafore
We a neat swagga, we could kiss after
But they say your boyfriend is a street fighter
That your smile from heaven oh
You dey dodge trying to be careful oh
We still going round the circles oh
If we don’t try we will never get to know
See as you fine
You shine from head to toe
Feelings they grow but you scared to show
Mama sa fun me mama beru oh
If them want am make we give them the show
You might also like[Chorus]
But I know oh ah
Kind of maybe really do like you
Maybe me and you we can try to
Do this love something
Maybe there’s something there
(I know there’s something)
And I know you
Kind of may be really do like me
Maybe I could be your baby
We should stop fronting
Maybe there’s something there
(I know there’s something)

[Verse 3: Falz]
But if I am too motivated then stop me
I been they feel love e dey costly
But I know say it’s not the same in your company
And this feeling is killing me softly
Me I didn’t want to be your roomie
But everybody seems to wanna talk to me
Even if me and you make the worst couple
If we no date woh we go cause trouble

[Verse 4: Simi]
I know I said I wanted to be friends oh
The truth be say that one na pretend oh
Maybe we can start again
Forget wetin I tell you then
Do you feel the chemistry
[Chorus]
But I know oh ah
Kind of maybe really do like you
Maybe me and you we can try to
Do this love something
Maybe there’s something there
(I know there’s something)
And I know you
Kind of may be really do like me
Maybe I could be your baby
We should stop fronting
Maybe there’s something there
(I know there’s something)
