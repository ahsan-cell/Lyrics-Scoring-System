Money dey ooze from my body continuously
On my grind like Mohammed Ali

Few hating but we sitting on the fence

Noni, why these girls fronting on me?
Why they try to put the evil spirit on me
I'm still upcoming but I'm getting money
And next year my skies is gonna be sunny
Ice Prince, I know you must have heard about me
I don't play piano, but I'm always on key
I always change gear, but I ride automatically
They compare me with the greatest and willingly I agree
I'm a big ass problem, industry government
I flow with intellect got the hood like I'm Robin
I'm sitting on the hill top, a lot is being expected
Now I'm getting salutes from the rappers I respected
Hehe, now I'm smiling to the bank
Freestyling with the gang
Still flying with the bird
And if you listen close, the record is on demand
And I don't listen to this hater talking
I'm trying to build a brand like
Like it's me, you're my homie
I be on every track and nobody can run me
Oh, they'd shitty rappers nobody can harm me
What more can I say, my Jehovah noni brah!
