[Verse 2]
And you know
Just like Adam and Eve
Anywhere that you go, I will follow
And you know
As I follow you to eat up the seed
We shall reap what we sow

Kwagh wou gande, mkede ava sha
Se er hanma kwagh together
Ki usu kpa se za
Havande kpa se za
Mngu undun we ga

[Bridge]
Follow the leader, enter the center
Make sure that you got me on the radar
If you dey follow follow open your eye and
Your mind and your sense so you eye no go red ah
All of them are coming and are wanting to fly
But them got no wings so they look up in the sky
And some of them a jump and throw them a die
Chai, guy
I don't know what I'm singing right now
Tell me, if you feel me, right now
Come to the dance floor
Let's get implicated, together, together
[Pre-Chorus]
Olele, olele
Ole jelapooloo lele
Olewua, olewua
Ole jelu bu lewua
Olele, olele
Ole jelapooloo lele

[Outro]
And you know
Just like Adam and Eve
Anywhere that you go, I will follow
And you know

We shall reap what we sow
Mngu orlo we mega
Mkenge we ki cha
Kwagh wou gande, mkede ava sha
Se er hanma kwagh together
Ki usu kpa se za
Havande kpa se za
