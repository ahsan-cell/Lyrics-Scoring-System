And move some body

Move it to the left, to the right (Got drunk and stumbled on two chicks)
Move it to the left, to the right (Say what? And after two drinks)
Move it to the left, to the right (I woke up in the bed like who’s this)
So I’m here with the girls them that likes to party (I came to party and bullshit)
And move some body (Got drunk and stumbled on two chicks)
So I’m here with guys them that likes to party (Say what? And after two drinks)
And move some body (I woke up in the bed like who's this)
