Chocolate city picture presents: MI, Brymo, MI2 , Action film
Let’s go (where's your ocada)
Left left left left left left (where's your danfo)
Left right left right left right (gbe keke e)
Ladies and gentleman, I am back (oya oya oya kalo)

[Chorus: Brymo]
I will like to take you for a ride
I’ll be your superman, I’ll take you to the sky
So fun won, kpe ko wa tasi mi
'Cause I be actor for this action film

[Verse 1]
Yo, back with a banger
For the hood, for the streets, for the zanga
The return of the microphone handler
Came back to set a new standard
More bread, more butter, more batter
More fanta, no coke, no ganja
So gifted that he must know santa
No slander let them hail his reign more Banta
They might wonder, they might ponder
How a short black boy can conquer
From a legedes benz to a Honda
To a crib from the bridge he was under
Did he do yahoo, did he launder
Now chicks follow bumper to bumper
See awards everywhere in the bunker
It’s the chocolate boss, Will Wonker

Haaaayyyy, Mo ti gbere mi de eeeeee
Go tell your mommy, tell your daddy, tell your brother too
And if you want me, baby let me know it cos I do
With you

[Chorus: Brymo]
I will like to take you for a ride
I’ll be your superman, I’ll take you to the sky
So fun won, kpe ko wa tasi mi
'Cause I be actor for this action film


[Verse 2]
Yo back with my new flow
For the club, for the street, for the studios
In my new crib, new car, new clothes
Same actor, different year, new boss
I am a bad guy
Who knows sharp guys
Who know fly guys
Who pop Nuvo
And the champagne do flow
Any time we celebrate
'Cause we generate new dough
And we off to conquer a new coast
Anywhere the game has got loopholes
All these rappers that be forming I-too-knows
They can’t keep up, they need glucose
Where did M come from?
Mehn who knows
No other rap sounds like Jude oh
And he’s not alone, he’s got two bros
For the two or one or who knows
Choc city boys say…
[Hook: Brymo]
Haaaayyyy, Mo ti gbere mi de eeeeee
Go tell your mommy, tell your daddy, tell your brother too
And if you want me, baby let me know it cos I do
With you

[Chorus: Brymo]
I will like to take you for a ride
I’ll be your superman, I’ll take you to the sky
So fun won, kpe ko wa tasi mi
'Cause I be actor for this action film

[Bridge]
O n se mi se mi
Bi ki n party party
Bobo toh soji soji
Oun ni baby reti
I am feeling fine
The mood is right
We on tonight
Let’s go there (Let’s go there)
Let’s go there (Let’s go there)
Let’s go there (Let’s go there)
Let’s go there (Let’s go there)
Let’s go there (Let’s go there)
Let’s go there (Let’s go there)
[Verse 3]
Yo back with the ginja
With the son of the carpenter
For another brand new adventure
My flow so cold, I bring winter
I am the lyrical kung fu ninja
Enemies all around tryna injure
MI holding down in the center
'Cause I’m championship like inter
These dudes can’t reach where I been to
Got the Mo’cheddah flow, can’t censor
And I stand all alone like oriental
But I am gentle , so simple, I’m a mental
See everytime I flow, I am a painter
Hip-hop’s in trouble, imma save her
C-city, Loopy, welcome to M.I the movie
