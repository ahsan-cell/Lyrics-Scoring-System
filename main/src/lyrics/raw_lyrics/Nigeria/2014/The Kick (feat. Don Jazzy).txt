[Verse 1: Wande Coal]
She say make I wife am
But I get so many girls I no fit lie for am
And I dey die for am
Anything she say she want say I go buy for am
First time wey I sight am
E just be like say make I bite am, bite am
Though not to spite am

[Bridge: Wande Coal]
No be say we just dey make mouth
And as you see me mehn I can’t shout
They like the way wey we dey spend cash
And when they see us all the ladies go dey bend yansh yeah
Sexy gon get it
A pack of John Pon
She say she gon sell it
She say she want a goody bag
Yes, she gon' get it
Your policy on point, I hope you gon lick it, kick it
