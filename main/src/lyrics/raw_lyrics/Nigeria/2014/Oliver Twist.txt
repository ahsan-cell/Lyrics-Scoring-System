I have a confession, don’t take it personal
I have a confession, so you got to listen
I have a confession, don’t take it personal
I say I have a confession, so you got to listen
See I like Beyoncé, but she dey with Jigga
I like Nicki, her yansh is bigger
I like Rihanna, she dey make me dey go gaga
I like Omotola 'cause people like her
I like Genevieve, I think that she’s so sweet
And Nadia Buhari 'cause she no dey drink garri
It’s not her fault you know
You cannot blame me though
I wanna have them all
I know it's wrong but the truth is that I'm just an Oliver
