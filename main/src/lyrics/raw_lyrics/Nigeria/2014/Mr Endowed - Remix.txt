[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Break the bank, take the girls
Travel all around the world
This is life, nah this is love
Have a drink, now live it up
Break it down, roll it up
Pass it 'round, take a buzz
Feeling grand, mil in hand
Check the game, I’m still the man
Ask D’banj and Don Jazzy
Iceman got me looking so flashy
Maybe they have the audacity sitting in my capacity
I said who said a lot of whooo
Maybe 'cause I'm old school
Drop it down low, set the mood
Without the stylist I am Mr. Endowed
