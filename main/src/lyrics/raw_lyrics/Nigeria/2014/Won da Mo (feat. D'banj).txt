A.k.a sting like a bee, Muhammad Ali
Chilling with Burna lee, in a private jet Lee
Evidently, Oliver twist
Ah banger, banger, banger, banger lee

Oya put your hands in the air, if you like ego
Push up your back like this, if you like ego
Take two steps in the zeus, if you like ego
Now show me your red bottom as you please, if you like ego

[Verse 3: Burna Boy]
No doubt, me get confidence
So much money in the bank
Dem a think say dem a people them drug trafficking
Una know say I dey talk many things for my song, that the people can't forget
Lyrically murder-murder the beat and leave the producer mark for it
And the values are winning, no forget
That's the reason I'm overconfident
Flows a burn out ma clip fi run out mi reload and put more cartridges
Or I think say you're back to the bone
But I know say me back to the cartilage
And if una no understand me
Boy now push the re-wind button and start again
More verses than the bible passages
Shey you see mi ri, lori DVD, abi TV ni
Place wey I dey, everyone can see, no be under G
Proud of my team, get money easily
Omo no look first, go back and see
Awon temi yapa nbi, ye, won da mo
