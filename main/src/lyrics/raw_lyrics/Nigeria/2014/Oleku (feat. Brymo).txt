Okay, I'm so interesting
It's why they say that I'm the next thing
See even on features I'm impressing
People do hate but I'm a flexing
Yeah, I learned the lesson
They throw me shots but Iâ€™m a chesting
I'm far from pop, my pop is resting
My flow so bad, my tongue is vexing
Yeah
No one is testing
I'm best by far is what I'm guessing
1 2 3, I win like wrestling
How can I lose? I'm with the best team
Yeah, I'm the boy with the fire
DJ's gimme more spin than a tire
Seen it all, done it all sang in the choir
Feeling like I'm tenor here only go higher
Yeah!

[Chorus: Brymo]

[Verse 2: Ice Prince]
Okay, it's so exciting
The game's been dull, but I'm igniting
Positive flow, I'm so attracting
Whether freestyles or even writing
Yeah, I put my life in
The bread don't cut, I put the knife in
My left hand weak, I put the right in
And take my bars from J to Brighton
Ha, I see the lightning, I know sometimes the rain is frightening
No matter how hard the seed is ripening
So when you hear Ice Prince say hyping, yeah
I don try plenty
I dey rap, I dey sing, I dey come MC
It's too many songs and I'm never empty
Now you chop stone if you want tempt me
Ah, ah

[Chorus: Brymo]
Oleku, tell me something wey I no fit do

[Verse 3: Ice Prince]
Okay, I'm so contagious
And no one done this good in ages
I put my foot in hell, courageous
Too many verse like Bible pages, yeah
And I hit their playlist, so I can grow up from low to apex
Until my account is fat and shapeless
Too many songs but mine is latest, yeah
So love or hate this
I'm getting my cake, I'm on the cake list
Beating my chest, I'm on the Ape list
You should be honored and bow to greatness, yeah
See my name's getting famous
My team's fire mehn, you cannot flame us
Na Baba God work, you cannot blame us
It's in vain when haters try aim us, yeah

[Chorus: Brymo]
Oleku, tell me something wey I no fit do
