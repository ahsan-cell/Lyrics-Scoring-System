Mami, I lose focus (eh)
Mami, I lose focus (Sway)
I swear down
Mami, I lose focus
When you can't tell me that you love me too
When, girl, I do
Oh! I lose focus

[Verse 1]
This is my new crave (eh)
The true love that you gave
Mami, you and I put together
We are meant to be new wave
Music my new bae
How can I leave, bae?
When you on my mind
All day, all night (Eh)
But we make up and break up
Watching you doing your make up
Lately you been acting like Bobrisky, always calling on Jacob (Jacurrb)
After the break up, next is my take off
Do you still want me, girl?
Or should I take off?

[Chorus]
Mami, I need focus
(Mami, I need focus, focus)
So, Mami, I need focus (eh)
I swear down!
Mami, I lost focus
When you can't tell me that you love me too
When, girl, I do
Oh! I need focus
Mami, I need (Mami)
Mami (Mami)
Oh, Mami, I need
Mami I need (Mami I need)
Mami, I lost focus
(Eh eh eh, sway, sway, uh, yeah)

All for the pounds, I fit lie to the queen
Love is blind, so I'm blind to the scene
Dodge a bullet, put my life for the film!
My love be like fire, she igniting the thing
Only one shot, girl, my rifle is clean
Shift delete the boy, don't recycle the bin
You date P Square, and recycle the twins

But I got a bigger plan, I'm tryna be a billionaire
