When I said to you that I never want to love another woman, girl it was true
So true
I meant to marry you and when I did, I'd be the one to take care of you, for you

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tunde]
Now you say you want to leave me girl
When around you I have built my world
Whatever you heard about me baby is definitely crazy
Please give me one chance to show

[Chorus: All]

[Verse 2: Shifi]
Girl I'll wait for you
And I know I'll never love another woman no one can do, but you
I'll pause my heart for you
When you come home, you'd be the one to make it move, only you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2: Shifi]
But before you finally leave me girl
Think about what you do to my world
Whatever you do to hurt me baby is gonna drive me crazy
Please give me one chance to show

[Chorus: All]
Olufunmi ooo
Ma pa mi lekun ooo
Olufunmilola
Mase fimi sile lai lai

Olufunmi ooo

[Chorus: All]
Olufunmi ooo
Ma pa mi lekun ooo

[Verse 3: Shifi]
Come on girl...
You could be the one to make me smile
You could be the one to make me wanna have a child
You could be the one I'd take on a date down the aisle
And be the first and the last girl to become my bride
You could be the one to make a fool of me
And you could be the one that'd be confusing me
Or you could be the girl in the world that I know through the rough times gonna stay true to me
You could be my Juliet
I may not have his looks but I would still be your Romeo
You could be my princess
I'd be your charming prince at the service of only you
That's why I never wanna love another woman
That's why I know I'll never love another woman
That's why I can never love another woman
That's why
[Bridge: Zeal]
That's why when I think about you leaving, I find myself grieving
Though it seems deceiving, I'm still believing
Girl you'll stay with me forever
And I'll remain humbly kneeling while your heart is healing
Tear drops revealing the way that I'm feeling
Girl please stay with me forever

[Chorus: All]
Olufunmi ooo
