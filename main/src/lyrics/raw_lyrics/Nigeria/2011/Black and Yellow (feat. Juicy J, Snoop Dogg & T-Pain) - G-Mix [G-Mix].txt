You could chill, I'm the one who get it, not the one who sell it
All grind every day (Day), I'm ballin', I can't help it
Niggas on that bullshit, my pockets full of Celtics
And them niggas hatin' on us get our best wishes
In the club, you ain't even on the guest list, bitch

Go to sleep rich and count another million when I wake up
Um, they wonderin' how I do my thing
