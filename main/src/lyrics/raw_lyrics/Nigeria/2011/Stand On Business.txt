Bitch ima king I belong in a castle
Dat money come to me without a hassle
I keep a pole but I’m not catchin mackerel

Ride wit a stick I be ready for battle
If you want smoke I’m not duckin no cattle
If u get caught then I know you gon tattle
Pick up the bag then I gotta skidaddle

Ain’t bout a check then don’t dial my digits
Like my toe broken I’m not tryna kick it
If you got a problem then you gotta fix it
I treat the work like a page and flip it

Scope on da stick bullets travel a distance
Play wit da guys they gone spin like a kick flip
Ran up dirty monеy then had to go rinse it
Don’t know you like dat bеtta stay out my business

Dat iron stay on me like I was a crease
Try me Nigga I’m at yo head like some grease
I’m not a puzzle but I keep a piece
Surrounded by sticks but I’m not in a tree

Like food when I’m hungry, devour the beat
Under pressure I know they gon fold like a sheet
Runnin up racks got me hurtin my feet
Beam on his head before he got to reach
You might also likeRemaining real i jus can't change it
Dat choppa hittin like tank davis
When u in too deep u can't escape it
Know ima be straight if i keep prayin

FN or the Glock i dont know which to carry
..dont want you round if you pussy or scary
..i stand out wherever im not ordinary
Dat broke talk it ain't in my vocabulary
