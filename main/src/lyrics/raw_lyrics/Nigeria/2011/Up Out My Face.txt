It's not chipped we're not cracked
Oh, we're shattered

[Verse 1]
I thought we had something special
And we had something good
But I shoulda had
Another mechanic under my hood
If you see me walking by ya
Boy don't you even speak
Pretend you on the sofa
And I'm on the TV
Might see me on a poster
See me at a show
But you won't see me for free
Boy this ain't no promo

[Pre-Chorus]
Actin' all shamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ
And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your
Momma's house
See Mariah Carey LiveGet tickets as low as $57You might also like[Chorus 1]
When I break I break, boy
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't never gonna feel
This thing again
You're gonna get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends
I ain't walkin around all mopey and sad
That ain't even my bag, baby
I break

[Verse 2]
So look who's cryin' now, boo hoo hoo
Talkin' about you're missing
Your boo hoo hoo
No you ain't getting it
No you ain't hittin' it
No you ain't a rapper so you need to stop
Spittin' it - ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha
You'll wonder who I'm messin'
With while you ain't next to me
I'm going bye...
So pay the consequences
'Cause you acting all ignorant
[Pre-Chorus]
So you're ashamed now
Wherever you be layin'
You can stay now
Gotta board the BBJ
And pull the shades down
I'm on the plane now
And don't keep calling from your
Momma's house

[Chorus 2]
When I break I break, boy
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
You ain't never gonna feel
This thing again
You're gonna get a lot of calls
'Cause I CC'd all your friends
I ain't walkin around all mopey and sad
They're collecting my bags, baby
I break
Cause when I break, I break, I break

[Bridge]
And no super glue can fix this shhh
When I break I break I break
Not even a welder and a builder
Can rebuild this shit when I break I
Break, I break
Not even a nail technician
With a whole lotta
Gel and acrylic can fix this
When I break, I break
If we were two Lego blocks
Even the Harvard University
Graduating class of 2010
Couldn't put us back together again
[Chorus 2]
When I break, boy
(Up out my face boy)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
(No no nooo-oo)
(I break I break I break)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
Up out my face, I break
(Yeah)
You ain't ever gonna
Feel this thing again
(Gonna feel this thing again)
You're gonna get a lot of calls
(Cause I)
Cause I CC'd all your friends
(Ha ha ha ha ha-aa)
I ain't walkin' around all mopey and sad
They're collecting my bags, baby
(Cause when I break baby baby)
I break, boy
(I brea-ee-ek)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Up out my face boy, up out my face boy)
Up out my face, I break
(I tell you what)
Up out my face boy, up out my face boy
(Tell you nothin')
Up out my face, I break
(Here, I'll tell you something)
(I'm outta here)
(Oh yeah)2
