[Verse 1, Mia Gladstone]
You, you could get me out on a Monday
I don’t have no doubt, you’re the one babe
Ain’t no turning back down a one way
So come with me
I been running ‘round on a slow day
We be hangin’ out at my old place
Smoke a lot of dope through the whole face

[Chorus, Mia Gladstone]
So come with me
Just come with me
So come with me
Just come with me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2, Kid Smoko]
Baby
Nowadays were seldom together
They see
Something ‘bout the way you move
Eyes running up and down your body
Days full of nothing but your company
I can see me [?] looking nothing like a [?], yeah
Comfortably
I’ve been biding time for you
Aimlessly
You don’t give me nothing but the shade you see
I can see me [?] looking nothing like a [?], yeah

Just come with me, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Bridge, Kid Smoko]
Nights like this you come and you go
Nights like this you freak me out
Nights like this you treat me like a rodent
Nights like this you stress me out
Nights like this you come and you go
Nights like this you freak me out
Nights like this you treat me like a rodent
Nights like this you stress me out

[Outro, Kid Smoko]
I can hear you cryin’
Tryna find out
Baby let me out, yeah
You’re innocent
I can hear you calling, you're calling
Feel like I’m a lover
Feel like I’m a drug you spread
Stressin’ me out
