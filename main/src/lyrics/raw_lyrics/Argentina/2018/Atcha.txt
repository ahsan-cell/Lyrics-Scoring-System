[Verse 1]
I catch you by the bus stop, my queen [?]
[?] back of the bus [?]
I'm tryna introduce myself
[?] kill myself
[?] tell me she's no good, [?] baby brother
Yeah, I know [?] junior and his so-called father
I heard about [?] court
The stuff about how he left 'em both broke without child support
Bag full of books and groceries she goes
Got you trust
Dedicated honey fo' sho'
Know she really wants a man dedicated to her
I'm still waitin' for my chance so I can tell her how I feel, yo

[Verse 2: Isam B]
So sweet, so beautiful
Everyday like a queen on her throne
Don't nobody knows how she feels
Aicha, lady, one day it'll be real (let's do it)
She moves, she moves like a breeze
I swear I can't get her out of my dreams
To have her shining right here by my side (shining like a star)
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes

Aicha, Aicha - passing me by (there she goes again)
Aicha, Aicha - my, my, my (is it really real)
Aicha, Aicha - smile for me now (I don't know, I don't know)
Aicha, Aicha - in my life

[Verse 3: Lenny Martinez]
Hija de la noche, la brisa
Se quema con su nombre, Aicha
Sentada con su cría
Es el centro de su vida
Protegiendo siempre el trono
Sudando noche y día
[?] no tiene porque
Si todo se derrumba, ya tiene la fe
Suficiente para seguir, para creer, para amar
Aicha niña, la reina de mi [?]

[Verse 4: Isam B]
She holds her child to her heart
Makes her feel like she is blessed from above
Falls asleep underneath her sweet tears
Her lullaby fades away with his fears

[Chorus: Isam B]
Aicha, Aicha - passing me by (there she goes again)
Aicha, Aicha - my, my, my
Aicha, Aicha - smile for me now (lean on)
Aicha, Aicha - in my life
[Bridge: Isam B]
She needs somebody to lean on
Someone body, mind and soul
To take her hand, to take her world
And show her the time of her life, so true
Throw the pain away for good
No more contemplating boo
No more contemplating boo

Oh!

[Verse 5: Isam B]
Lord knows the way she feels
Everyday in his name she begins
To have her shining here by my side
I'd sacrifice all them tears in my eyes
[Hook: Isam B]
Aicha, Aicha - passing me by (sweetest thing)
Aicha, Aicha - my, my, my (not even knowin')
Aicha, Aicha - smile for me now (what am I to do?)
Aicha, Aicha - in my life (mmhmm)
Aicha, Aicha - passing me by (sweetest thing)
Aicha, Aicha - my, my, my (not even knowin')
Aicha, Aicha - smile for me now
Aicha, Aicha - in my life (mmhmm)
