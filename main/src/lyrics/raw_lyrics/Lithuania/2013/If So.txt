Everybody's taking what they can
But they can't decide
And they do what they want to
'Cause any kind of feeling's alright

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And don't be talking maybe
Your mama's flying high as a kite
You're just like the next one
'Cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

[Chorus]
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming

[Verse 2]
Everyone's faking like they can
It makes it alright
Tell me what you want to
'Cause I don't know the wrong from the right
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just don't be talking maybe
Your mama's still high as a kite
And I'm just like the next one
'Cause we'll be walking lonely tonight
Lonely tonight

[Chorus]
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming

[Chorus]
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming
If so, if so
We know, we'll be coming7
