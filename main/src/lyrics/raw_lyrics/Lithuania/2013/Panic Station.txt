You won't get much closer 'til you sacrifice it all (All)
You won't get to taste it with your face against the wall (Wall, wall)
Get up and commit, show the power trapped within (–In, –in)
Do just what you want to and now stand up and begin, uh

[Chorus]
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station

[Verse 2]
Doubts will try to break you, unleash your heart and soul (Soul)
Trouble will surround you, start taking some control (–trol!)
Stand up and deliver your wildest fantasy (–sy, –sy)
Do what the fuck you want to, there's no one to appea-ea-ease

[Chorus]
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station

[Interlude]
Waahoh!
Hey!
Uuh!

[Outro]
Oooh-aaah, oooh-aaah
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And this chaos, it defies imagination
Oooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives
And I know that you will fight for the duration
Oooh 1, 2, 3, 4 fire's in your eyes
And I know I'm not resisting your temptations
Oooh 5, 6, 7, 8 minus 9 lives
You've arrived at panic station
Woow!
Woo! Ugh!6
