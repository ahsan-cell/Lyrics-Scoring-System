We burned and we bled, we try to forget
But the memories left are still haunting
The walls that we built from bottles and pills
We swallow until we're not talking

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire

[Chorus]
What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (Oh, oh)
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove

[Verse 2]
Started a stranger, a lover in danger
The edge of a knife
The face of an angel, the heart of a ghost
Was it a dream?

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I am a man on fire
You, a violent desire
You might also like[Chorus]
What a dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Don't know why we still hide what we've beco-o-ome (Oh, oh)
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I am a man on fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire
You, a violent desire

[Chorus]
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove
Do you wanna cross the line?
We're runnin' out of time
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
A dangerous night to fall in lo-o-ove (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)7
