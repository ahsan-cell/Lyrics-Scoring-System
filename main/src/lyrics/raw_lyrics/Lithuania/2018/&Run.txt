You could be another face that I forget soon as I move along
Everybody makes mistakes; am I mistaken for the way I carry on?
You could show a little grace, but maybe things just went a bit too far
We are just who we are; no time for "what if"s and "what if not"s

[Chorus]
Heavy as the setting sun
Oh, I'm counting all the numbers between zero and one
Happy, but a little lost
Well, I don't know what I don't know
So I'll kick my shoes off and run (yeah)
Kick my shoes off and run
Kick my shoes off and run (run, we'll be running barefoot)
Kick my shoes off and run
Kick my shoes off and

[Verse 2]
You could be a happy bride and we could still be blissfully in love
Instead of being 25 and already feeling like you have had enough
You could be my one regret, infinitely spiraling me down
Sometimes the world feels loud

[Chorus]
Heavy as the setting sun
Oh, I'm counting all the numbers between zero and one
Happy, but a little lost
Well, I don't know what I don't know
So I'll kick my shoes off and run (yeah)
Kick my shoes off and run
Kick my shoes off and run (run, we'll be running barefoot)
Kick my shoes off and run
Kick my shoes off and

Run
Run, run, run
Run
Run, run, run

[Chorus]
Heavy as the setting sun
Oh, I'm counting all the numbers between zero and one (run, run, run)
Happy, but a little lost
Well, I don't know what I don't know
So I'll kick my shoes off and
Run into the setting sun

[Outro]
Run, run, run
Run into the setting sun
Run, run, run
I'll run into the setting sun
Run, run, run
I'll run into the setting sun2
