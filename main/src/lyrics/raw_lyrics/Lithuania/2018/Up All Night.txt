When you get the rhythm and words all make you cold
When they break it down and this world is all you know
Hands up, you're working it 'round
Now get yourself together
When you call the dominoes fall, it's time to go

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm feeling so far away
I see the colors and all the kids going home
Night is crawling up to the day
I hear the noise ringing
The sirens all singing

[Chorus]
Just wanna stay up all night with you
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do
Just wanna stay up all night with you

[Post-Chorus]
Keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now
Keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now
Oh, keep on moving
Don't wait, don't wait for nothing now
Oh, keep on moving
Don't wait for nothing now, nothing now

One, two, what you doing?
I been jumping through some hoops
Wanna get my body loose
Wanna tell you, tell you what to do
I been running out of bounds like an animal struggling
Looking for a diamond
I'm trying, I'm fighting
Right into the rhythm now

[Bridge]
I just wanna stay up all night
Wanna stay up all night with you
With you, you

[Chorus]
Just wanna stay up all night with you (wanna stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you
There's nothing that I wouldn't rather do (than stay up all night)
Just wanna stay up all night with you

[Outro]
Put it up in the air
If you don't really care
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Hands up in the air
Living out on a prayer
Let them know that you're there
If you got the time to take it up there
Up all night with you
With you, with you5
