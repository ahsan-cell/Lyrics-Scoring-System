My home is a girl with eyes like wishing wells
I'm not alone but I'm still lone-lonely
When I was young, always gold below the midnight sun
Those days are done, but I'm still glowing

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la-la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning, oh my, oh well
When you're gone, goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la-la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning, got soul to sell
When you're gone, goodbye, so long, farewell

[Verse 2]
My home is a girl who can't wait for time to tell
God only knows we don't need history
Your family swinging from the branches of a tree
God only knows we don't need ghost stories

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la-la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning, oh my, oh well
When you're gone, goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la-la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning, got soul to sell
When you're gone, goodbye, so long, farewell

If (You) your company don't
Nothing's gonna comfort me now
If (You) your company don't
Nothing's gonna comfort me

[Chorus]
Ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la-la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning, oh my, oh well
When you're gone, goodbye, so long, farewell
Ooh-ooh, la-la-la-la-la
Let's live in the moment
Come back Sunday morning, got soul to sell
When you're gone, goodbye, so long, farewell

[Outro]
Oh, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come and watch the garden grow
I'll see you when you get there
Oh, God, I can't believe my eyes
Wake up everybody you know
Come and watch the garden grow
I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there
I'll see you when you get there9
