Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missin' me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young

[Chorus: Jack Met]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I wanna feel somethin' again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?

[Verse 2: Jack Met]
"Goodbye, goodbye"
I said to my best-est buds
We said that we'd keep in touch
And we did our best
All my new friends
We smile at party time
But soon we forget to smile
At anything else
You might also like[Chorus: Jack Met]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I want to feel somethin' again
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?

[Post-Chorus: Jack Met]
How's it go again? (Go again, go again, go againâ€¦)

[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo]
My favorite color is you
You're vibratin' out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be
My favorite color is you
You're vibratin' out my frequency
My favorite color is you
You keep me young and that's how I wanna be

[Verse 1: Jack Met]
Hello, hello
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
I hope that you're missin' me
'Cause it makes me feel young
Hello, hello
Last time that I saw your face
Was recess in second grade
And it made me feel young
[Pre-Chorus: Jack Met]
And I want to feel somethin' again
I just wanna feel somethin' again
How's it go again?

[Chorus: Jack Met]
Won't you help me sober up?
Growin' up, it made me numb
And I want to feel somethin' again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me sober up?
All the big kids, they got drunk
And I want to feel somethin' again (My favorite color is you)
Won't you help me feel somethin' again? (My favorite color is you)
Can I finally feel somethin' again?
How's it go again?33
