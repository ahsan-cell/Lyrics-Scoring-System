Work a 9 to 5 then the beat on deck
I'm just gunning for that Beats1 set
And I ain't even sold a gold record yet
I'm dreaming big yeah the beast won't rest
I ain't in the streets but the banging on check
Hanging in the West but the East I rep
South Florida made then we moved to a place
That I grew to reclaim with some neat rhymes yes
I just said neat that was weak I guess
But I'm man enough to admit defeat
You're insecurities keep you from being able to s-s-speak
While I'm over here repeating that I did my best
(that I did my best)
Test, who could make your girl wanna show off her breasts
With just one text, I'm blessed
I feel like someone above don't wanna see me all stressed

[Chorus]
My chicks are hotter than pornstars man I get it I get it I get it
My whip is faster than your car man I get it I get it I get it
My dick as big as your forearm man I get it I get it I get it
I get it I get it I get it, I get it I get it I get it

[Verse 2]
Walls, closing in thoughts of life
I'm in a mindset I never know what's wrong or right
I guess I never knew right from wrong at night I'm gone
Bottles on my counter pills and alcohol they don't mix well
Like when I'm producing
While fucked up I'm losing my mind but it fits well
I guess I always knew I was different
I was that kid in my room writing some shit always killing it
Now I'm in a position to rip it
Making music's the only thing I know how to do it's
Ironic I'm making this into a living when half of my shit is depressing
Half of the time I'm making jokes about dying and wishing I wasn't even fucking living
This year's been something though
The last time I gave a real fuck was six months ago
Now I'm giving fake fucks to fake chicks that love to blow
Life's a bitch but my life's the shit I love it bro
You might also like[Chorus]
My chicks are hotter than pornstars man I get it I get it I get it
My whip is faster than your car man I get it I get it I get it
My dick as big as your forearm man I get it I get it I get it
PrXnce Street, this beat, we get it we get it we get it

[Verse 3]
Mr. Resourceful, voice hoarse from a sore throat
It ain't from hollering at these whores though
I got kicked in the neck cause I pissed of Mr. Ed
When I took a hammer to Wilbur Post's dome
I'm having an adamant identity crisis battle with Caitlyn
She ain't even the least attractive Kardashian (sorry Khloe)
I'd still get at it though, at the ho with a cattle rope
And hope that I can trade her for Kendall, she's team Strasner
After the acquisition I've got her in a position
That looks similar to if I had punched her right in the bladder so
I put it in her Gronkowski, Beast Mode I found that open hole
Even Chris Berman knows I could go all the way
Of course I did, I'm rapping harder than foreskin
Least I think I am Ima Jew so I don't know what it's for man
Donna came up behind me and hugged me while I was reciting
Lyrics to Mila Kunis the bitch thought I was Eric Foreman
Just do it like Shia La, Stylez like tinted Corvettes
Cause I sting, rays of sunshine I won't let
In the vicinity killing beats with lyrics as ill as me
Feeling me wishing death to my enemies pour me another glass of Hennessy
A recipe for disaster, taking shots of Tabasco cause I'm a fiery asshole
But alas I'm just another rapper after your cash flow
Ain't gotta explain that y'all know how that goes
[Bridge]
This is my life
My, my life my life is a
My, my life my life is a
My, my life my life is a

[Chorus]
My chicks are hotter than pornstars man I get it I get it I get it
My whip is faster than your car man I get it I get it I get it
My dick as big as your forearm man I get it I get it I get it
25 by 25 man we get it we get it we get it

[Outro]
My, my life my life is a
My, my life my life is a
My, my life my life is a
My, my life my life is a
My life is amazing2
