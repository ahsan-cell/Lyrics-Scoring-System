What are the open plans but land to roam and cultivate
Reciprocate trade and share
To give and to take
To respect the Indian way?

I will no longer cry
For what has passed is gone
Like a memory that floats in the air
The song of an eagle feather
Climbing in the wind
On a hot summer day
On a hot summer day

[Verse 1]
I've seen eyes they were crying sadly
Fists ready for the blow
Seen turbulent skies above me
Buterflies in the snow

Saw a war in a mask and a costume
In a jingle of leaders to blame
Seen power in the hands of the wrong man
Who will always be just the same?

[Verse 2]
Seen boys cross illegal borders
Risk a life to wash a dish
Seen money disguised as the answer
Is that your only wish?

Seen a man who treasures life
As a woman now able to choose
From a strength that I need to survive

[Chorus]
Truth, nothing but the truth
Watch you coming today?
Watch you coming today?
The things you say When you give and you take
When you take and you take and you take

The truth, nothing but the truth
In the name of nature
The choices we make
Is it only me?
Is it only you?
Are we only living for today?

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe today will be my day
Before it's over
I'll make a change

Maybe today will be my day
Before it's over
I'll have my say
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Verse 3]
May the walls on the road be witnesses
Of the needs of your ticking heart
The words that you love be spoken
At your table and when you part

May your long line of family members
Be proud of who you've become
May your hands and your soul remind you
Everyday that you are around

[Verse 4]
May the house that is always clean
Be the home to the ones in need
May the dirt on the soles of your boots
Make a track of the good will you leave

May the words that were used to divide
Float away far away out of sight
And the mountain we still must climb
Be the one we will climb to unite
[Chorus]
Truth, nothing but the truth
Watch you coming today?
Watch you coming today?
The things you say
When you give and you take
When you take and you take and you take

The truth, nothing but the truth
In the name of nature
The choices we make
Is it only me?
Is it only you?
Are we only living for today?

[Post-Chorus]
Maybe today will be my day
Before it's over
I'll make a change

Maybe today will be my day
Before it's over
I'll have my say

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
