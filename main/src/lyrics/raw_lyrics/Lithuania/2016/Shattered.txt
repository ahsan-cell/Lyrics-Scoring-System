Fall into your sunlight

The future's open wide beyond believing
To know why hope dies.

Losing what was found, a world so hollow
Suspended in a compromise

The silence of this sound is soon to follow
Somehow sundown
And finding answers is forgetting all of the questions we called home
Passing the graves of the unknown
This reason clouds my eyes, splendor fading
Illusions of the sunlight

The reflection of a lie will keep me waiting
Love gone for so long
And this day's ending is the proof of time killing all the faith I know
Knowing that faith is all I hold
And I've lost who I am and I can't understand
Why my heart is so broken, rejecting your love
Without love, gone wrong; lifeless words, carry on
But I know, all I know's that the end's beginning
Who I am from the start, take me home to my heart
Let me go and I will run, I will not be silent
All this time spent in vain; wasted years, wasted gain;
All is lost, hope remains and this war's not over

There's a light, there's the sun, taking all shattered ones
To the place we belong, and his love will conquer

And I've lost who I am and I can't understand
Why my heart is so broken, rejecting your love

Without love, gone wrong; lifeless words, carry on
But I know, all I know's that the end's beginning

Who I am from the start, take me home to my heart
Let me go and I will run, I will not be silent

All this time spent in vain; wasted years, wasted gain;
All is lost, hope remains and this war's not over

There's a light, there's the sun, taking all shattered ones
To the place we belong, and his love will conquer all
(His love will come, yeah)
