All the kids are throwing sticks
Politics
Nights on the wire
Everybody wants to get by
It's a test of the times
A test of my rights
It's on, pretty lady

[Verse 2]
Born to be angry
Grip of the vice
Click on the trigger, girl
Sip wine on ice
It's about time
Best to rewind
You better blow
(Pistols, pistols, pistols)

[Chorus]
Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tightrope
Don't go, go
It's about time, it's about time
You might also like[Verse 3]
Everybody come on
Lights on the beaches
Everybody come on, delight
Close the front door
I don't wanna go
Like I'm on the "Truman Show"
Best to let go
You don't wanna know
Ya better blow
(Pistols, pistols, pistols)

[Chorus]
Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tightrope
Don't go, go
It's about time, it's about

[Bridge]
All the years of paradise
Paradigms
Paralyze us
You're crazy
All the cards you've organized
Shuffled twice in front of my eyes
Everybody has
Needs, wants, a cold gun
[Chorus]
Lights low
Go on baby go
It's about time
I'm on a tightrope
Don't go, go
It's about time, it's about
(Pistols, pistols)7
