Run to the light
It won't save you tonight
All our yesterdays are pictures lost in time
Never enough
Towers crumble to dust
Looking back on the moments of our lives

[Chorus]
All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

[Verse 2]
Stars still burn bright
Seasons change overnight
As we find our way, the times, they come and go
Look back in love
A new day rises above
With a wind that comes to carry you back home

All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

[Bridge]
Days go by!

[Chorus]
All your anger, all your hurt
Doesn't matter in the end
Those days go by
And we all start again
What you had and what you lost
They're all memories in the wind
Those days go by
And we all start again

What you had and what you lost
What you had and what you lost
[Outro]
Those days go by
Those days go by
Those days go by
