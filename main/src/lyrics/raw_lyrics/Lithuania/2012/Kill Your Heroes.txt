Woo!
Come on!
Uh!

[Verse 1]
Well, I met an old man dyin' on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well, he said one thing before I graduate
"Never let your fear decide your fate"

[Chorus]
I say you kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause everybody will die
Every day we just go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry, we love you more than you know

[Verse 2]
Well, the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well, I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

[Chorus]
I say you kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause everybody will die
Every day we just, go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry, we love you more than you know
