Yeah
She was built with a brain and some swagger
A little scream, little cry, little laughter
She's a ten, I'm a joke in my own mind
But she still loves to dance with my punch lines, yeah
Punch, punch
Punch, punch, punch

[Pre-Chorus]
This love found us, now I see it
This love, up, down, please believe

[Chorus]
Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And baby 'cause I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And maybe I'm a little confused
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And baby, it's the wonderful news
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, it's not that you should care
I just wanted you to know
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'mma fight with myself 'til I'm bleeding
Just a taste of your skin, start the healing
Anyone from my past, get your ammo
Find my sun in the dark side of my shadow, yeah
Punch, punch
Punch, punch, punch

[Pre-Chorus]
This love found us, now I see it
This love, up, down, please believe

[Chorus]
Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And baby 'cause I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And maybe I'm a little confused
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And baby, it's the wonderful news
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, it's not that you should care
I just wanted you to know

Oh, it's not that you should care

[Chorus]
Baby, when I'm yellin' at you
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And baby 'cause I'm crazy for you
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And maybe I'm a little confused
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
And baby, it's the wonderful news
It's not your fault, it's not your fault, yeah
[Post-Chorus]
