Got a headache coming on strong
And I feel my body tremble
You keep talkin' on and on and on
Wondering why I'm not long gone

[Pre-Chorus: Meggie York]
I'm sitting here on the other side of the porch
Where we would meet
But wasting time in another life where we think
We were all we need

[Chorus: Meggie York]
'Cause I am trying to find another piece of your mind
Just one more night
Just one more night

[Drop: Meggie York]
Just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night

[Verse 2: Meggie York]
And you nevеr thought id learn how
So it's time to let it all out
No morе secrets between you and i
If you keep it, that means its a lie
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Meggie York]
And I'm sitting here in the dead of night on my own
With no one around
But wasting time in another life where I wish
That I won't be found

[Chorus: Meggie York]
'Cause I am trying to find another piece of your mind
Just one more night
Just one more night

[Drop: Meggie York]
Just one more night
Just one more night
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, one more night
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Oh-woah, just one more
