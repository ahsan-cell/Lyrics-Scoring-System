**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus - Indila]**  
Miss me, miss me, you're the one who makes me feel  
Make me feel for real  
In the night, in the night, you know when I close my eyes  
I can hear your voice forever  
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling  
Giving, flying, falling, fighting, crying, living, writing, when you love me  
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling  
Giving, flying, falling, fighting, crying, living, writing, when you love me  

**[Verse 1 - Youssoupha]**  
I write texts in relief, just with simple rhymes  
I haven't traded my dreams for a check of a thousand bucks  
When I'm on stage, and the crowd backs me up  
It's thanks to Philo, my brother: big up to my big black!  
I left my hometown, forced away by the sound of gunfire  
In the street, the walls have ears, and the bricks speak  
Reference rap, you know I don't play games  
Hoping that this damn showbiz won't break me  
One way or another, I dreamed of touching the sky  
I couldn't be an astronaut, so I took to the stage  
I have one foot on the ground, the other in the void  
One foot in the superficial, the other in the faith  
I have a heart with my people, a heart with the crazy  
A heart in my hand, a heart in the middle of the crowd  
As a refrain for the audience around me  
There's this voice that returns, to tell you all my love  
To tell you all my love...  

**[Chorus - Indila]**  
Miss me, miss me, you're the one who makes me feel  
Make me feel for real  
In the night, in the night, you know when I close my eyes  
I can hear your voice forever  
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling  
Giving, flying, falling, fighting, crying, living, writing, when you love me  
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling  
Giving, flying, falling, fighting, crying, living, writing, when you love me  

**[Verse 2 - Youssoupha]**  
I light a candle to illuminate our regrets  
And I move quickly, so I donâ€™t stay outside  
Time flows fast, so we need gold  
I have the flow of LL Cool J when I need love  
I have one hand on my loved ones, the other on a woman  
One hand on the microphone, the other on a weapon  
Success is significant, but we must keep our bearings  
The prettier the medal, the heavier the downside  
I write these few lines because often I get lost  
Defeat is orphaned, victory has a thousand fathers  
I have one eye on our lives, one eye on the world  
One eye on my son, one eye on the watch  
My life without the crowd: a sad anesthesia  
When I suffer for you, I suffer with pleasure  
As a refrain for the audience around me  
There's this voice that returns to remind you of my love  
To remind you of my love...  

**[Chorus - Indila]**  
Miss me, miss me, you're the one who makes me feel  
Make me feel for real  
In the night, in the night, you know when I close my eyes  
I can hear your voice forever  
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling  
Giving, flying, falling, fighting, crying, living, writing, when you love me  
I'm dreaming, singing, hoping, smiling  
Giving, flying, falling, fighting, crying, living, writing, when you love me  

**[Outro - Indila]**  
No one else but you  
I'm nothing without you  
I don't want it to end  
My love is in your hands  
No one else but you  
I'm nothing without you  
I don't want it to end  
My love is in your hands
