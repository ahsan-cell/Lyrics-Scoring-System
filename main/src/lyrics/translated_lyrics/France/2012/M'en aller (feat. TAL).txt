**Translated Lyrics:**

**(Chorus)**
Gonna leave (gonna leave)  
Gonna escape (gonna escape)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Wohohoo  

**(Verse 1: Canardo)**  
I need nothing, but it’s not enough to just say it to believe  
Every summer is the same, the sun shines in the park  
I need cash and sand before I go crazy  
I need to draw a line, to escape, to take off  
On the fridge, the same postcard in the same colors  
Craving beaches, turquoise waters, and a cocktail in a shaker  
I need nothing, you remember, but don’t believe me  
Longing for elsewhere, wherever you want as long as it’s far, you and me  

**(Chorus: Tal)**  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Wohohoo  

**(Verse 2: Canardo)**  
I could hitchhike, but I prefer business class  
DVDs, meal trays, and even pretty hostesses  
I could make excuses, tell myself "it’s pointless"  
Need to see elsewhere, where you feel good  
Yeah, I won’t hide that I really want to drop everything  
Easier said than done when the street has marked you  
And to escape, I look at this postcard  
And I tell myself "one day, I promise, you and I will break free"  

**(Chorus: Tal)**  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Wohohoo  

**(Verse 3: Canardo)**  
Here, the days repeat, but nothing is infinite  
You know, not everyone has Gandhi's patience  
We have time to die, but not time to build  
Barely five minutes, I know how this will end  
You think you know our lives? "Living like this" is just one percent  
So many things inside me, but I can’t find words strong enough  
We no longer count our failures; we could make necklaces out of them  
But hey, we’re remaking the world, sitting on a staircase  

**(Bridge: Canardo then Canardo & Tal)**  
Change course, don’t be afraid to sink  
Take the road and drive, until we never stop  
Change course, don’t be afraid to sink  
Take the road and drive, until we never stop  

**(Chorus: Tal)**  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Gonna leave (wohohoo)  
Gonna escape (wohohoo)  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Wohohoo  

**(Chorus: Tal & Canardo, then both)**  
Gonna leave (yeah)  
Gonna escape (Canardo)  
Yes, here comes another season (Tal)  
A postcard as my horizon  
Gonna leave (gonna leave)  
Gonna escape  
Yes, here comes another season  
A postcard as my horizon  
Wohohoo  

**(Outro: Canardo)**
