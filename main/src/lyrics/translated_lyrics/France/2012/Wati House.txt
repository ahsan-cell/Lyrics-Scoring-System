**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Maître Gims]  
Hey, brother, hey  
Murder  
The inspiration comes from Me-da  
It looks like a hold-up to me  
Bring me my soda  
Call me Doctor Gero  
Speed like Agüero  
Paris is becoming Soweto  
Gonna have to get up early  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Heeeey mi amor, it’s a death sentence  
Heeeey mi amor, it’s a death sentence  
Please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  

[Interlude: Maître Gims & Lefa]  
But who’s going to pay for the broken pieces? Who?  
Who will pay for the broken pieces?  
Damn, but who’s going to pay for the broken pieces? Who?  
Surely not the people from the nice neighborhoods  

[Verse 2: Lefa]  
Damn, you’ve gotten yourself in trouble  
You shouldn’t have acted tough, we’re gonna take you down  
Stop your act, we’re not improvising heroes  
I even rap on electro, call me the Torero  
A special shout-out to our enemies, come come see us on stage  
To everyone who was at the Zénith... We love you!  
Always surrounded by my associates, Barack and the White guy to sauce me up  
Ca-ca-catapulted to the top, solar system  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Heeeey mi amor, it’s a death sentence  
Heeeey mi amor, it’s a death sentence  
Please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  

[Verse 3: Black M]  
It’s us making noise while the FN sleeps, FN sleeps F-F-FN sleeps  
I’m at the door with my brothers, brother, open the door, open the door, O-O-Open the door  
I said: It’s us making noise while the FN sleeps, FN sleeps F-F-FN sleeps  
I’m at the door with my brothers, brother, open the door, open the door, o-o-open the door  
Beriz, in the hood we lack khaliss (money)  
In my head, it’s Africa, I see all the Wa in Mali  
Uh... Come on brother, make your Nicki Tissage (weave) shine  
Lie to her, tell her she has the most beautiful face  
Go-go-go on, turn up the sound, bring the swag, bring the... Aaah  
Here, dancing is mandatory, minimum the little... Not!  
Damn, as the boss says, there are problems  
Just like a Paris-OM (football rivalry), I need to jump off the Seine  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Heeeey mi amor, it’s a death sentence  
Heeeey mi amor, it’s a death sentence  
Please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  

[Bridge: Maître Gims, JR O Crom & Barack Adama]  
Pump pump pump pump it up  
Pump pump it pump it up  
This is the sound, can you feel it, Paris Center  
This is the sound that takes back your license  
Pump pump pump pump it up  
Pump pump it pump it up  
Don’t ask who’s hitting, it’s the Wa, it drives you crazy  
In the lyrics, in the clubs, in the Porsches  
Pump pump pump pump it up  
Pump pump it pump it up  
Number 1, don’t doubt it  
Wati B a.k.a the boat that doesn’t sink  
Pump pump pump pump it up  
Pump pump it pump it up  
We’ll see each other after the aperitif...  
¡Guapa te quiero! (Beautiful, I love you!)  

[Outro: Maître Gims, Lefa & Black M]  
Wa-ti B, baby  
You recognized the voice, the hit style  
Oh hey, hey lady, you recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
Pa-name Ci-ty, you recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(Ma-Ma-Ma-Marrakech) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(London) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(A-A-A-Abidjan) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(Lisbon) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(Du-du-baï) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(I-I-I-I-Ibiza) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
(Mia-Miami) You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  
You recognized the style of the guys from Wa  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please  
Mi amor please
