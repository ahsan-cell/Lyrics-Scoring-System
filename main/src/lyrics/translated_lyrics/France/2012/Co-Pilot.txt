**Translated Lyrics:**

**Co-Pilot**  
**Co-Pilot**  
**Co-Pilot**  

**Kristina:**  
We can go wherever you want to go  
We just need to fuel it up  
Try to catch us if you can  
This flight isn’t about to... What’s up?  
Ohhh  

**Corneille:**  
I dream of leaving the ground, but I can’t do it alone  
You and I on the same flight for life, what do you say?  
Hold my hand, let’s take off, leave the past behind  
Oh ohhh  

**[Chorus] Corneille:**  
I’ll take you beyond your reason  

**Kristina:**  
I'm gonna take this club to the city of love  

**Corneille:**  
I’m looking for a co-pilot  
You could join me  
Where I never planned to go  
I’ll take you beyond your reason  
Forget everything we know at the edge of the horizon  
If you’re looking for a co-pilot  
I could accompany you  
You might also like  

**Kristina:**  
Baby, be my co-pilot, hey hey  

We can be who we want to be  
Won't we take it to the top?  
You can be my wingman  
Chillin' in the Mile High Club  
Oh ohhh  

**Corneille:**  
We’ll leave the ground together, you’ll see  
You and I on the same flight for life, what do you say?  
Hold my hand, let’s take off, leave the past behind  
Oh ohhh  

**[Chorus] Corneille:**  
I’ll take you beyond your reason  
Forget everything we know at the edge of the horizon  

**Kristina:**  
Come, we're gonna find it  

**Corneille:**  
I could accompany you  

**Kristina:**  
Let me be your co-pilot, hey hey  
Oh oh  

**Corneille:**  
I’ll take you beyond your reason  
Have you ever crossed to the other side of sound?  

**Kristina:**  
Come, we're gonna find it  

**Corneille:**  
I could accompany you  

**Kristina:**  
I can be your co-pilot, yeah  

Yooo  
Co-pilot  
Co-pilot  
Co-pilot  
Hey hey hey  
Yooo  
Co-pilot  
Co-pilot  
Co-pilot  
Hey hey hey  

**Corneille:**  
We’ll go from Paris to Kinshasa  
**Kristina:**  
We laugh with the DJ, in a pretty boy  
The boys are mine in the cockpit  

**Corneille:**  
They say we’ll visit  
That we’ll forget Bali  

(I'm gonna take this club to the city of love...  
Come, we're gonna fly in)  

**[Chorus] Corneille:**  
I’ll take you beyond your reason  

**Kristina:**  
I'm gonna take this club to the city of love  

**Corneille:**  
I’m looking for a co-pilot  
You could join me  
Where I never planned to go  
I’ll take you beyond your reason  
Forget everything we know at the edge of the horizon  
If you’re looking for a co-pilot  
I could accompany you  
Baby, be my co-pilot  
Hey hey hey  
Ayooo
