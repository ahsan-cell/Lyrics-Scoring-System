Things are tough and it’s distressing, yeah  
If the crisis worsens, yeah  
It’s because we let the bad ones govern (eh!)

The Holy Father will take care of the rest, yeah (aaih)  

[Bridge: Houston]  
Even if you don’t have much money (eeeh)

[Verse: Houston]  
To let loose, you have to dance ééé  
If nothing is going right in your life, simply

[Verse: Peter]  
See, the true story is this  
This music isn’t new  
It started off like a game  
In France, we’ve been throwing it out  
So let’s get serious, hey (Chai!!)  
Because it’s business, yeah  
That’s why we’re trying to rejoice, yeah (Why?!)  
'Cause it’s not easy, yeah (it’s not easy, yeah)  

[Verse: Paul]  
Even if you don’t have money  
They’re still enjoying themselves  
Because the way you’ll get angry and complain  
If it’s not God, yeah  
Then it’s like a dead body  
Nobody is born a baby  
And when you fall, you stand up again  
You try again  
Again and again, and again  

[Peter & Paul]  
'Cause it’s not easy, yeah (Wohohohoooh)  
For Peter and Paul and Matt Houston  
It’s not easy, eh (Wohohohooh)  
My brother, my sister

God, it’s your handiwork, yeah yeah yeah  

[Refrain]  
Don’t forget (Ohohooooh)  
Stay positive in our minds  
Don’t forget (Ohohooooh)  
My brother, my sister  
Even if it’s not easy, yeah (Ohohooooh)
