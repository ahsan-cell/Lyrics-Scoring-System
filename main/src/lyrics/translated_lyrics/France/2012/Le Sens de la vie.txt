**Translated Lyrics:**

I wanted to sleep, and I closed my eyes  
Without even seeing that the sky was blue  
I woke up under a new sun  
And since that day, nothing's the same  
Lights of the spotlight warming my heart  
Deep inside me, I’m never afraid anymore  

I found the meaning of the reason that drives me  
With every step on the front of the stage  
I found the meaning of the life I lead  
And I love it  

It’s obvious, I’ve found my way  
I’m taking flight, but I won’t forget  
The words of a childhood song  
That reminds me where I come from, where I find my luck  
Artificial light that makes my eyes shine  
And I step out of the shadows, I know what I want  

I found the meaning of the reason that drives me  
With every step on the front of the stage (mmh no)  
I found the meaning of the life I lead (the life I lead)  
And I love it (and I love it)  

Through sense and nonsense, we always get lost  
When we don’t do things with a little love  
Maybe it’s love that makes our ambition fascinating  
It’s in my voice, that’s why I sing, no!  

I found the meaning of the reason that drives me  
With every step on the front of the stage (mmh no)  
I found the meaning of the life I lead (the life I lead)  
And I love it (and I love it)  

I found the meaning of the reason that drives me  
With every step on the front of the stage  
I found the meaning of the life I lead (the meaning of the life I lead)  
And I love it  

Even in the veiled sky  
There’s always a star that sparkles  
And guides us on the path of our dreams  
And when we believe, a new day rises!  

I found the meaning of the reason that drives me  
With every step on the front of the stage  
I found the meaning of the life I lead (the life I lead)  
And I love it (and I love it)  
I found the meaning of the reason that drives me (yeah)  
With every step on the front of the stage (the meaning of life)  
I found the meaning of the life I lead  
And I love it
