**Translated Lyrics:**

200 watts  
In a pair of boots  
Delicate and carefree  
It's not just talk  
When she smiles at me  
I lose my mind  
With sleepless nights  

**[Chorus]**  
You pin me up like a poster on the wall  
I file a complaint for assault and injury  
I was just a breath away  
From going crazy for you  
Crazy for you  

**[Verse 2]**  
200 watts  
In a pair of boots  
Delicate and carefree  
With blurry eyes  
She seems so far from everything  
When she pouts at me  
My heart boils over, oh, oh  

**[Chorus]**  
You pin me up like a poster on the wall  
I file a complaint for assault and injury  
I was just a breath away  
From going crazy for you  
Crazy for you  

**[Bridge]**  
You track me down and loom over me  
From Paris to Hong Kong  
You attack me and I fall  
Honor wounded  

**[Chorus]**  
You pin me up like a poster on the wall  
I file a complaint  
I know I'll pay for it, that's for sure  
I was just a breath away  
From losing my whole arm  
My whole arm
