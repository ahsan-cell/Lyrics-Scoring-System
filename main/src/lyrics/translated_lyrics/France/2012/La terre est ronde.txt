**Translated Lyrics:**

Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home  

[Verse 1]  
You need a car to get to work  
You work to pay off the car you just bought  
You see the kind of vicious cycle?  
The kind of stuff that makes you want to do anything but grow old  
You can run endlessly  
Chasing happiness, the Earth is round, might as well wait here  
I’m not lazy, but I feel sluggish  
And it’s going to end up with me on sick leave for the whole week  
I want to enjoy the people I love  
I want to take my time, before time takes me and carries me away  
I have hundreds of things on the go  
But I’ll just do what I want anyway!  

[Chorus]  
Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home  
Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home  

[Verse 2]  
Rappers give the same advice as my parents  
Do what you want in life, but above all, make money  
I’m trying to find balance  
What’s the point of preparing for the future if you forget to live?  
In my boxers serving as pajamas  
Instead of kissing up to my boss for an advance he won’t give me  
Tonight, I’ll gather the crew  
In the meantime, thanks for calling, but please: speak after the beep  
Today I feel good  
I wouldn’t want to ruin it, I’ll put everything off until tomorrow  
There’s really nothing I truly need  
We’ll see if I lose my way along the path  

[Chorus]  
Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home  
Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home  

[Bridge]  
Why do everything right away that we can do later?  
All we want is to enjoy the moment  
We blossom in the evening light  
All we want is to be able to live now  
Why do everything right away that we can do later?  
All we want is to enjoy the moment  
We blossom in the evening light  
All we want is to be able to live now  

[Chorus]  
Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home  
Deep down, I believe the Earth is round  
For one good reason...  
After traveling around the world  
All we want is to be at home
