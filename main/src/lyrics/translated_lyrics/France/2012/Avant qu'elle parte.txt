**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Maître Gims]  
Insane, insensitive, you love her but still you run away  
Insane, insensitive, you love her but still you run away  

[Verse 1: Doomams]  
Forgive me for your sleepless nights, repeating  
Forgive me for the waiting lines, the clashes at inspections  
Forgive me for the interrogations, the searches  
Forgive me for leaving so soon to become a musician  
All the times I forgot to reply to your messages  
All the times I was supposed to see you between gigs  
All the times I had to lie to avoid your wrath  
Through it all, I never doubted your good intentions  

[Verse 2: Maska]  
Your mother is a rare flower nourished by your love  
To deprive her of it is to kill her, so don’t cut short her countdown  
Tell her you love her, that you regret being so confrontational  
She struggles to escape because your older brothers are so firm  
Is it my wrinkles that keep me from smiling at her?  
I don’t want to live to see her die  
Your tears sting my wounds, I wish to make you happy  
Forever, I curse the day we lay you to rest  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
And even when everyone is against you, she remains your best friend  
You wish you could tell her what she means to you before she loses her life  
But you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  
And you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  
And even when everyone is against you, she remains your best friend  
You wish you could tell her what she means to you before she loses her life  
But you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  
And you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  

[Verse 3: Black M]  
I’m sure she’d just love to hear a “Mom, I love you”  
Instead of the shouts from Dad threatening to throw you out  
I’m sure she breaks down after a week without you  
And that your absence hurts her more than a fall from her roof  
I’m sure she wishes you’d hold her in your arms  
Just like she did during your first twelve months  
I’m sure love has made you blind  
Instead of giving it to your mother, you give it to a fool  

[Verse 4: Barack Adama & Lefa]  
Hours on the phone with your girl to get closer  
When your mother calls, you want to hang up quickly  
In front of your friends, you stand up to her, wanting to teach her lessons  
But you forget that she held that head when she nursed you  
Believe me,  
We can replace lungs but surely not a mother  
You lived in her, you lived under her roof  
She’s the only one who prays to leave this world before you  
At the police station, you were never guilty for her  
But for me, you are because you’re tanned while she’s pale  
Besides her, no one can stand your constant selfishness  
You’re not the center of the world, but you are for your mom  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
And even when everyone is against you, she remains your best friend  
You wish you could tell her what she means to you before she loses her life  
But you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  
And you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  
And even when everyone is against you, she remains your best friend  
You wish you could tell her what she means to you before she loses her life  
But you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  
And you don’t dare, you don’t dare, you don’t dare to say it  

[Verse 5: Maître Gims]  
I’ve never left  
I’ve never changed  
Except for my voice and my height  
Oh Mom, it’s me  
I want you to approve of my fiancée  
Comfort me like when I fell  
Mom, where have you gone?  
Oh, look at me  

[Verse 6: JR O Crom]  
Just holding you in my arms  
Holding you tight to say I love you one last time, rest in peace  
For us, you gave body and soul, if I run out of ink, I’ll continue with my tears, brother  
Today, Mom is no longer here  
I fell from high, but I couldn’t fall lower  
Buddy, don’t play the child of the foster care system  
If you have one, make her happy:
