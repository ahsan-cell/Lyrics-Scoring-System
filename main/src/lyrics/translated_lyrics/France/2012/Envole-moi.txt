**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: M. Pokora]  
Midnight rises above the towers  
Voices fall silent, everything becomes blind and deaf  
The night conceals for a few hours  
The dirty streets, the wrecks, and the ugliness  

[Pre-Chorus: Tal]  
I didn't choose to be born here  
Between ignorance, violence, and boredom  
I will make it out, I promise myself  
And if necessary, I'll use legal means  

[Chorus: M. Pokora & Tal]  
Fly me away, fly me away, fly me away  
Far from this fate that clings to my skin  
Fly me away, fly me away  
Fill my head with other horizons, other words  
Fly me away  

[Verse 2: M. Pokora]  
No questions or rebellion  
Rules of the game set, but the dice are loaded  
Winter is ice, summer is fire  
Here, there’s never a season to feel better  

[Pre-Chorus: M. Pokora & Tal]  
I didn't choose to live here  
Between submission, fear, or abandonment  
I will make it out, I swear to you  
With the power of books, I will break through all these walls  

[Chorus: M. Pokora & Tal]  
Fly me away, fly me away, fly me away  
Far from this fate that clings to my skin  
Fly me away, fly me away  
Fill my head with other horizons, other words  
Fly me away  

[Post-Chorus: M. Pokora & Tal]  
Don't leave me here, take me away, fly me away  
To meet other eyes that refuse to resign  
Fly me away, pull me from here  
Show me those other lives that I don't know  
Fly me away  
Fly me away, fly me away, fly me away  
Look at me closely, I don’t resemble them  
Don’t leave me here, fly me away  
With or without you, I won’t end up like this  
Fly me away  

[Outro: Tal]  
Fly me away
