**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Everything is just a game of masks  
Anthrax dust that seeps into our wounds  
Oh demon, he who  
Consumes our lives  
Breathes the heat, the cold  
Who else but me sees it?

[Chorus]  
To tell him "fuck you too" forever  
Requiem to start anew  
No more "sorry, sorry," no more in my flesh  
You and your double friend return to Hell

[Verse 2]  
See, violent is the grip  
And no limits, the soulmate stripped of a heart  
When everything is a lie  
That wounds and gnaws at me  
There, I doubt and I bleed  
No matter, life teaches me

[Chorus]  
To tell him "fuck you too" forever  
Requiem to start anew  
No more "sorry, sorry," no more in my flesh  
You and your double friend return to Hell  

[Instrumental Pause]

[Verse 3]  
Feeling alone in the world  
He knows how to reach your heart  
Everything flips in a few seconds  
Iâ€™m no longer afraid, only a wave of nausea remains

[Chorus]  
To tell him "fuck you too" forever  
Requiem to start anew  
No more "sorry, sorry," no more in my flesh  
You and your double friend return to Hell
