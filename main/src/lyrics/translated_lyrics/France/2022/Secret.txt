**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You know, I’m not ready to see you grow up  
I’m scared of what you’ll become  
Because I know what it’s like to feel pain  
And I can’t stop you from feeling pain  
You know, I want you to be happy  
And I want to see you fall in love  
And even though I want to protect you  
Sometimes I’ll have to watch you fall  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And if girls  
Seem fragile to you  
Know that you have within you  
A strength that unfolds  
Like all girls  
It won’t be easy  
But I believe in you  

[Chorus]  
I’m going to share with you my biggest secret  
I’ve always had a hard time loving myself  
And I learn every day to be gentle  
I think I haven’t fully grown, I’m waiting for it to bloom  
I’m going to share with you my biggest secret  
I’ve always had a hard time loving myself  
Now what I hope with all my heart  
Is that you won’t make the same mistake  

[Verse 2]  
I know it’s not simple to face the mirrors  
That sometimes you’ll cry in the dark  
I’ve lived it a thousand times before you  
It’s still inside me  
And if it’s hard not to look at  
Others without feeling forgotten  
You need to know that I understand you  
That growing up sometimes takes time  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And if girls  
Seem fragile to you  
Know that you have within you  
A strength that unfolds  
Like all girls  
It won’t be easy  
But I believe in you  

[Chorus]  
I’m going to share with you my biggest secret  
I’ve always had a hard time loving myself  
And I learn every day to be gentle  
I think I haven’t fully grown, I’m waiting for it to bloom  
I’m going to share with you my biggest secret  
I’ve always had a hard time loving myself  
Now what I hope with all my heart  
Is that you won’t make the same mistake  

[Outro]  
I’m going to share with you my biggest secret  
I’ve always had a hard time loving myself
