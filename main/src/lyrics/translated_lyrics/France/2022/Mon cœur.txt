**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
My heart  
My heart  

[Verse 1]  
Caught up in the waves, constant information  
No respite, not a single second  
My heart, my heart  
And your beat quickens, Iâ€™m going to end up losing you  
Scream your lungs out, shake off the fever  
My heart, my heart  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So young, already tired from the blows that disrupt you  
Not once has it left you, this damn urge to fight  
Blow up the monitor and the electrocardiograms  
My heart, my heart  

[Chorus]  
One, two, three, I believe you  
When you hold up with all your might  
Your strength and your faith while everything around you  
Collapses and crashes, the reason we lived for  
One, two, three, I believe you  
When you hold up with all your might  
Your strength and your faith while everything around you  
Collapses and crashes, the reason we lived for  

[Verse 2]  
I take the brunt of your anger, silence drives you mad  
Whatever the cause, nothing leaves you indifferent  
My heart, my heart  
Thumping in my chest  
Need air, I have to breathe  
Calm your fervor, regain your colors  
My heart, my heart  
My heart, my heart  

[Chorus]  
One, two, three, I believe you  
When you hold up with all your might  
Your strength and your faith while everything around you  
Collapses and crashes, the reason we lived for  
One, two, three, I believe you  
When you hold up with all your might  
Your strength and your faith while everything around you  
Collapses and crashes, the reason we lived for  
My heart  
My heart  
My heart  

[Interlude]  
So young, already tired from the blows that disrupt you  
Not once has it left you, this damn urge to fight  
Blow up the monitor, my heart  

[Chorus]  
One, two, three, I believe you  
When you hold up with all your might  
Your strength and your faith while everything around you  
Collapses and crashes, the reason we lived for  
One, two, three, I believe you  
When you hold up with all your might  
Your strength and your faith while everything around you  
Collapses and crashes, the reason we lived for  

[Exit]  
My heart  
My heart  
My heart
