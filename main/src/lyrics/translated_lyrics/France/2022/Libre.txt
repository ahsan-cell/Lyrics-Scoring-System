**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Free, here I am, this is my path, right here  
The next part in music, on stage, behind the scenes  
Free, here I am, but without you, right here  
The next part in freewheel, all in balance  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I was scared before, I spoke so softly  
I was never in front, oh no, today I've really changed, believe me  

[Chorus]  
Take good care of yourself  
I already know your game  
I'm free and that won't change  
Yes, take good care of yourself (Eh)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Living free, I don't want to fall anymore  
Into the trap of the fools, they kneel down  
Living free, believe me, it will change  
I've stayed standing and I've come to enjoy it  

[Verse 2]  
I'm free, here I am, this is my path, right here  
But what do you think? I won't forget  
And dry your tears because they won't wash away  
All your weapons raised against me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I was scared before, I spoke so softly  
I was never in front, oh no, today I've really changed, believe me  

[Chorus]  
Take good care of yourself  
I already know your game  
I'm free and that won't change  
Yes, take good care of yourself (Eh)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Living free, I don't want to fall anymore  
Into the trap of the fools, they kneel down  
Living free, believe me, it will change  
I've stayed standing and I've come to enjoy it  

[Bridge]  
And I disturb you but it's stronger than me  
Too caught up for an angel, I didn't even believe it myself  
All this time spent on that  
I've hit rock bottom but I'm free (Eh)  

[Chorus]  
Living free (Living free), I don't want to fall anymore (Ah-ah)  
Into the trap of the fools, they kneel down (Ah-ah)  
Living free (Living free), believe me, it will change (Ah-ah)  
I've stayed standing and I've come to enjoy it (Ah)  

[Outro]  
I'm free, here I am
