**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I want him to feel it, I keep him locked up at my place  
The coming months will be ugly, and we’ll spend them together  
Ah, I’m so unhappy without her, and I want him to feel it  
I want to see him, see him, and I’d go as far as to have the shirt stained with blood  
Until the drool and the sobs  
I’ll speak like an Italian: with my hands  
And finally, I’ll have no secrets left to tell you  
Sculpting with a hammer, painting with a knife  
I’ve never felt this creative before  
Tomorrow, I’ll engrave my grief on his skin  
And my scale will show ten kilos less  
Unquenchable anger, I’m not sorry  
He’s dead, the sun

[Chorus]  
Oh my God, how I miss her  
Everything fades away in a decrescendo  
My Earth will soon come to a stop  
And it’s someone else’s fault  
Oh my God, what a loss  
Everything fades away in a decrescendo  
Soon there’ll be nothing left to lose  
I’ll take care of that someone else  

[Verse 2]  
Oh, I want him to feel it  
I seek the noise like a drug in the silence  
My memory plays the worst melodies  
I try to eject the disc, oh  
But it starts again, and my molars spark  
I’m losing it, and the only one who could help me is her, what irony  
Ah yeah, what irony  
Okay, if I’ve been staring at the clock hands  
Until the end of the night  
It wasn’t to see if the clock was working  
The more I interview myself, the less I know who I am  
Just that girl, that’s all I ask for  
I wouldn’t know what to do with the rest of the world  
I desired her desperately  
And now, I feel so lost

[Chorus]  
Oh my God, how I miss her  
Everything fades away in a decrescendo  
My Earth will soon come to a stop  
And it’s someone else’s fault  
Oh my God, what a loss  
Everything fades away in a decrescendo  
Soon there’ll be nothing left to lose  
I’ll take care of that someone else  
Oh my God, how I miss her  
Everything fades away in a decrescendo, oh  
My Earth will soon come to a stop  
It’s surely someone else’s fault  
Oh my God, what a loss  
Everything fades away in a decrescendo  
I’ll soon have nothing left to lose  
I’ll take care of that someone else  
Take care of that someone else  

[Outro]  
Take care of that someone else
