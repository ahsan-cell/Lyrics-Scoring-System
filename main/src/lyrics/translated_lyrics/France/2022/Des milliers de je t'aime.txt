**Translated Lyrics:**

No need to search anymore, no need, I found you  
It’s nothing, all the harm they did to me, I found you  
I thought I knew everything about love, but that’s not true  
If I loved them deeply, with you, it’s so much more

[Pre-Chorus]  
Look how beautiful we are on the same boat, mmh-mmh  
Oh no, there’s nothing more beautiful, love is never too much, mmh-mmh

[Chorus]  
If you only knew how much I love you  
Your little heart trailing behind  
And if you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”  
If you only knew how much I love you  
Your little heart trailing behind  
And if you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”

[Verse 2]  
We fight against a world that tells us to stop, but  
In the cold, in the tears, I will be your shield  
If it’s too much, if you’re afraid your hands will let go of me  
I’ll hold you tighter, I will be the strongest

[Pre-Chorus]  
Look how beautiful we are on the same boat, mmh-mmh  
Oh no, there’s nothing more beautiful, love is never too much, mmh-mmh

[Chorus]  
If you only knew how much I love you  
Your little heart trailing behind  
And if you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”  
If you only knew how much I love you  
Your little heart trailing behind  
And if you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”

[Bridge]  
My little heart gives your little heart thousands of “I love you”  
My little heart gives your little heart thousands of “I love you”

[Chorus]  
If you only knew how much I love you  
Your little heart trailing behind  
And if you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”  
If you only knew how much I love you  
Your little heart trailing behind  
And if you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”  
If you’re feeling pain  
You’ll find in my arms thousands of “I love you”
