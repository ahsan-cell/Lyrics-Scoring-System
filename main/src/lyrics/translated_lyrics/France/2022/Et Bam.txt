**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Gare du Nord in November  
Hair all in disarray  
Like a knot in my stomach  
That pulls me tight, that twists me  
And Paris spreads out  
Suddenly, here I am  
With trembling legs  
How grand it feels to me  
This imposing scene  
Where everything becomes fragile  

[Chorus]  
And bam, and bam in my chest  
Mom, I did it for this  
I don’t want, I don’t want America  
I want this beating heart  
And bam, and bam to the music  
Mom, I did it for you  
I don’t want, I don’t want America  

[Verse 2]  
My childhood has flown away  
But nothing ever erases  
The dreams or the violence  
Oh yes, it chills you  
But that’s why we sing  
Let me fail  
And let the rain come  
They can never take away  
That I’ve already won  
New friends  

[Chorus]  
And bam, and bam in my chest  
Mom, I did it for this  
I don’t want, I don’t want America  
I want this beating heart  
And bam, and bam to the music  
Mom, I did it for you  
I don’t want, I don’t want America  

[Bridge]  
And louder than my voice  
I hear it pounding  
This heart that beats  
And sweeps away my tears  
And my whys  

[Chorus]  
And bam, and bam in my chest  
Mom, I did it for this  
I don’t want, I don’t want America  
I want this beating heart  
And bam, and bam to the music  
Ladies and gentlemen, here I am  
I don’t want, I don’t want America  

[Outro]  
I want this beating heart  
And bam, and bam  
And bam, and bam  
And bam, and bam  
I want this beating heart
