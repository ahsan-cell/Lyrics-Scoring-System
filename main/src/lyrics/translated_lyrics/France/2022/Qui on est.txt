**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We all have things we don’t possess  
A family, friends, some clothes, or a place to rest  
We do all we can, all that we must  
But sometimes life keeps us from seeing the trust  
Of course, we’re all born with our own chance  
But some will find luck in their dance  
It’s in the rain that we learn to sway  
We rise higher when we’ve come a long way  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What we say, what we want, what we see  
I believe it’s all the same, you’ll agree  
What we flee from, what we claim, our fights  
I think we’re all alike in these lights  

[Chorus]  
Hey! Come, let’s love who we are  
Come, let’s cherish what we have so far  
No need to rush ahead  
Happiness we dread  
When it was right here all along  
Come, let’s love who we are  
Come, let’s cherish what we have so far  
With a hand on our shoulder  
When happiness draws closer  
It’s good that it was there all along  

[Verse 2]  
We all wish for what we don’t own  
Long hair, a house, or a lovely one to call our own  
Even those who have it all  
Always want more, they heed the call  
Forgetting to be happy is like playing Russian roulette  
Of course, we lose a bit of innocence, you bet  
When fate strikes without a sign  
If we just arm ourselves with patience, we’ll be fine  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes when we’ve lost our voice  
Maybe it’s time to listen and rejoice  
It’s then that love makes its decree  
That we find someone to stand by me  

[Chorus]  
Hey! Come, let’s love who we are  
Come, let’s cherish what we have so far  
No need to rush ahead  
Happiness we dread  
When it was right here all along  
Come, let’s love who we are  
Come, let’s cherish what we have so far  
With a hand on our shoulder  
When happiness draws closer  
It’s good that it was there all along  
Come, let’s love who we are  
Come, let’s cherish what we have so far  
No need to rush ahead  
Happiness we dread  
When it was right here all along  
Come, let’s love who we are  
Come, let’s cherish what we have so far  
With a hand on our shoulder  
When happiness draws closer  
It’s good that it was there all along
