**Translated Lyrics:**

Your hair has grown, I see  
That your head has changed  
I love you more than before, I believe  
You have a broken smile  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I tell myself  
That if I don’t recognize myself  
If I’m not the same anymore  
It might be thanks to me  

[Chorus]  
And I still steal, steal my joys  
I want more even if I don’t understand  
Why I change and sometimes  
I’m so afraid that night won’t come  
Because when I sleep, I dream of that  
Of understanding everything and knowing why  
On somewhat clumsy chords  
I still manage to capture my joy  

I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  
I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  

[Verse]  
You’ve left a bit behind  
Your former self  
You’ve grown a little, made choices  
There are never good moments  
You’ve walked, you’ve run, that’s good  
But lie down now  
Tell your stories, analyze them  
It avoids the band-aids  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And I tell myself  
You see, trust yourself  
As long as we have those we love  
We’re already lucky  

[Chorus]  
And I still steal, steal my joys  
I want more even if I don’t understand  
Why I change and sometimes  
I’m so afraid that night won’t come  
Because when I sleep, I dream of that  
Of understanding everything and knowing why  
On somewhat clumsy chords  
I still manage to capture my joy  

I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  
I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  

[Bridge]  
(I want to know everything, and see in the dark.)  
(I want to know everything, and see in the dark.)  

[Chorus]  
And I still steal, steal my joys  
I want more even if I don’t understand  
Why I change and sometimes  
I’m so afraid that night won’t come  
Because when I sleep, I dream of that  
Of understanding everything and knowing why  
On somewhat clumsy chords  
I still manage to capture my joy  

I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  
I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  

(I want to know everything, and see in the dark.)  
(I want to know everything, and see in the dark.)  
I want to know everything  
And see in the dark  
I want to know everything  
And see in the dark
