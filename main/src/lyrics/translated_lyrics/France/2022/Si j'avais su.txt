**[Verse 1]**  
I would have told you all the things I never said  
That your skin smells like roses, that I adore the name Édith  
I would have shared all the things we don’t say often enough  
Because often, in life, we don’t dare to speak up while there’s still time  
I would have described the sea to you, so you could see it once more  
We would have sent the nurse away, then laughed out loud  
I would have told you that your face reminds me of the ocean  
That your wrinkles look like waves, where children go to swim  

**[Chorus]**  
If I had known, when I left that night  
If I had known, that time doesn’t wait  
If I had known, if I had known  
That it was the first time  
That I saw you for the last time  

**[Verse 2]**  
I would have fixed your bun, and you would have said, "It pulls"  
And I would have acted a bit silly, just to see your smile  
I would have promised to write a song, telling how beautiful you were  
Telling how foolish we are, to believe that people are eternal  
And then, I would have held you so tight, there would be marks on your neck  
I would have looked at you again, and then I would have kept you, above all  
I would have locked you in my eyes, captured your scent  
I would have said "goodbye," a little better, then I would have lied, "see you tomorrow"  

**[Chorus]**  
If I had known  
When I left that night  
If I had known  
That time doesn’t wait  
If I had known, if I had known  
That it was the first time  
That I saw you for the last time  

**[Bridge]**  
I would have rushed to love you, like one chases after life  
Because we never love enough, I would have told you "I love you," too  
Words shouldn’t be kept, they should be shared all around  
Otherwise, what are words for, if not to decorate graves?  

**[Chorus]**  
If I had known  
When I left that night  
If I had known  
That time doesn’t wait  
If I had known, if I had known  
But often, we don’t realize  
That we see someone for the last time
