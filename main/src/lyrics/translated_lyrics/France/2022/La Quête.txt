**[Verse 1]**  
Nothing can take me back, further than the smell of modeling clay  
Mom's a kindergarten teacher, she's even the one next door  
I'm five years old and I sneak through the window to hide in her class  
She tells me, "You're not supposed to be here," I say, "Next to you is where I belong"  
I love books, I prefer being alone, so I'm happier when it rains  
I take a few catechism classes, but I'm not sure I believe in God  
I'm seven, life is easy, when I don't know, I ask my mother  
One day she told me, "I don't know everything," I lost faith in the Universe  

**[Chorus]**  
At five, I just wanted to be seven  
At seven, I was eager to see what’s next  
Today, I’d rather time just stopped  
Ah, what matters isn’t the arrival, it’s the quest  

**[Verse 2]**  
I sweep the dead leaves on the field, the cold gives me blisters on my hands  
I'm ten, I'm a basketball fan, I dress like a little American  
My dad, my hero, got me the Jordan 8s with the Velcro straps  
So I do everything to make him proud when he comes to watch me at every game  
I start middle school, they call me a rich kid, of course: my shoes cost a fortune  
I don’t want to wear them anymore, my dad gets mad: "You have everything, we had nothing"  
I'm twelve, I cause chaos in class to try to make friends  
The music teacher is losing it, he’s in the paradise of teachers  

**[Chorus]**  
At eleven, I just wanted to be thirteen  
At thirteen, I was eager to see what’s next  
Today, I’d rather time just stopped  
Ah, what matters isn’t the arrival, it’s the quest  

**[Verse 3]**  
Often, I've fallen in love, but for once it’s mutual  
I cowardly abandon all my friends, I only see my girl, we smoke cigarettes  
At fourteen, I’m just a ghost, or at least that’s what my parents say  
Honey wants me to hang out more with her, yet she sulks all the time  
Since I’m moving, it separates us, I tell myself love is overrated  
My brother beats me at basketball, so I’d rather give up  
I’m fifteen, I watch Kids on repeat, I hang out with guys like Casper  
My dad is strict with me, so I take it out on my brother  

**[Chorus]**  
At fifteen, I just wanted to be sixteen  
At sixteen, I was eager to see what’s next  
Today, I’d rather time just stopped  
Ah, what matters isn’t the arrival, it’s the quest  

**[Verse 4]**  
I go down the stairs, fear in my stomach, to intercept my report card  
At home, it’s a cold war, we don’t understand each other anymore, so I say nothing  
I’m sixteen and I sneak through the window to join the others at the skatepark  
We drink beers, we smoke joints, and I tell all this in my raps  
The years go by, maybe a bit too fast, to the point that I dare not sing my age  
My brother films when I put on the ring, my sister hosts the wedding  
The things I dare not say to anyone are the same that fill the halls  
Mom is there, my dad is proud, and the Universe isn’t so bad  

**[Chorus]**  
At sixteen, I just wanted to be seventeen  
At seventeen, I was eager to see what’s next  
Today, I’d rather time just stopped  
Ah, what matters isn’t the arrival, it’s the quest  
At five, I just wanted to be seven  
At seven, I was eager to see what’s next  
Today, I’d rather time just stopped  
Ah, what matters isn’t the arrival, it’s the quest
