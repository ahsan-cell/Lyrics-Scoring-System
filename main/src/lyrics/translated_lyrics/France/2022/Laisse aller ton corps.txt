**Translated Lyrics:**

I believe they’re still calling my name  
I believe they’re still calling my name  
I believe they’re still calling my name  
I believe they’re still calling my name  

[Verse 1]  
I believe they’re still calling my name on the turntables  
I believe they still want sound from the machines  
I believe we still have flashes in our retinas  
And we don’t want to fall into routine just yet  
I believe Paris wants to dance in the jungle  
To abandon our bodies in the Pampas*  
At midnight, Matador for his geishas  
At two o'clock, effortlessly far from the edges-edges-edges  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want you to dance in the club, no mystery  
I want you to enjoy yourself far from the clusters  
I want screams on the dance floor  
I’ve put your name on the list  
I want you to play your whole life like an actor  
I want you to ride all night like a surfer  
I want your mouth on hers  
I want your tongue on mine  

[Chorus]  
Let your body go, the dance floor is yours  
Until noon without effort, until noon without effort  
Let your body go, the dance floor is yours  
I know tomorrow will wait, oh yes, tomorrow will wait  

[Verse 2]  
I believe they’re still calling my name in the club  
I believe they want to dance on the subs  
I believe we still have in our pupils  
The love of bodies facing each other that elevates us  
I believe Paris wants to swim in vice  
To abandon our weapons in the sky  
At midnight, Matador, all the risks  
At two o'clock, effortlessly amethysts*  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want you to dance in the club, no mystery  
I want you to enjoy yourself far from the clusters  
I want screams on the dance floor  
I’ve put your name on the list  

[Chorus]  
Let your body go, the dance floor is yours  
Until noon without effort, until noon without effort  
Let your body go, the dance floor is yours  
I know tomorrow will wait, oh yes, tomorrow will wait  

[Bridge]  
Let it go, your  
Let it go, your  
Let it go, your  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want you to dance in the club, no mystery  
(let it go)  
I want you to enjoy yourself far from the clusters  
(let it go)  
I want screams on the dance floor (let it go)  
I’ve put your name on the list (let it go)  
I want you to play your whole life like an actor  
(let your body go)  
I want you to ride all night like a surfer  
(let your body go)  
I want your mouth on hers (let your body go)  
I want your tongue on mine  

[Chorus]  
Let your body go, the dance floor is yours  
Until noon without effort, until noon without effort  
Let your body go, the dance floor is yours  
I know tomorrow will wait, oh yes, tomorrow will wait  

[Outro]  
Let your body go, let your body go  
Let your body go, let your body go  
Let your body go, let your body go  
Let your body go, let your body go  
Let your body go...
