**Heartbeats**

[Verse 1]  
You're like a veil that clings to every nail  
You fray, you wear down with every blow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You hurt yourself  
Often, you hurt yourself  
You hurt yourself  
Often, you hurt yourself  

[Chorus]  
Love only strikes  
The heart and never lets anyone  
Make you believe otherwise  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes  
The heart and never lets anyone  
Make you believe otherwise  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes the heart  

[Verse 2]  
Your skin is thin like cigarette paper  
Every time it’s hit, a violet blooms there  

[Pre-Chorus]  
They hurt you  
I don’t want them to hurt you  

[Chorus]  
Love only strikes  
The heart and never lets anyone  
Make you believe otherwise  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes  
The heart and never lets anyone  
Make you believe otherwise  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes the heart  

[Bridge]  
Love, love has never killed anyone  
And the only blows that love forgives  
Are the lightning strikes  
Love has never killed anyone  
And the only blows that love forgives  
Are the lightning strikes  

[Bridge]  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes the heart  

[Chorus]  
Love only strikes  
The heart and never lets anyone  
Make you believe otherwise  
Love only strikes the heart  
Love only strikes the heart  

[Outro]  
Love, love has never killed anyone  
And the only blows that love forgives  
Are the lightning strikes  
Love has never killed anyone  
And the only blows that love forgives  
Are the lightning strikes
