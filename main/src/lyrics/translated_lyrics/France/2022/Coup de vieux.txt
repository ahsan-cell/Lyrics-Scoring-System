**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Oli]  
Eh  
My generation, it has, it has  

[Verse 1: Oli]  
Forgot all about studying for the finals  
She wants a dealer not too far from campus  
She grew up, she doesn’t care what people think  
She wants a one-night stand that lasts two years  
She used to build giant towers with Kapla blocks  
And travel the world on Encarta  
She scratched a pool to get through August  
Counting coins to buy a mammoth's testicle  
Twice as many gifts, parents separated  
She signed up for the gym but never went  
Milk always after the Cocoa Puffs  
She won’t admit it, but she danced the tecktonik  
High as a kite, she watches Space Zinzins  
Writing stuff in white-out on her Eastpak  
High School Musical, Hannah Montana  
Karaoke at Lake Connemara  
Aserejé ja de je  
No one understood, but everyone sang along  
In her living room, she has construction signs  
She collects them when she’s drunk  

[Bridge: Oli]  
I’m talking about a time that those under twenty can’t know  
I’m talking about a time that those under twenty...  

[Chorus: Bigflo, Oli & Julien Doré]  
It was better back then, rewind time, first gray hairs  
I’ve felt the weight of age  
It was better back then, rewind time, first gray hairs  
I’ve felt the weight of age  

[Post-Chorus: Bigflo, Oli & Julien Doré]  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
It was better back then  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I’ve felt the weight of age  

[Verse 2: Julien Doré]  
Soon turning forty, I knew Zelda  
I saw Régine and Jay-Jay Okocha play  
Generation blues, Booster or 103  
The years go by, who will remember?  

[Verse 3: Bigflo]  
My generation, it just wants to sleep, it’s exhausted  
Passing exams without studying  
Bar hopping until four in the morning  
Then cracking up in front of Mission Cleopatra  
Still shocked by Happy Tree Friends  
Flour on the two-meter chewing gum  
She had Magix, she had Pogs  
On the 3310, there was Crazy Frog  
Big Baby Bop dreams of Tokyo  
She drank a Yop while watching Code Lyoko  
Because of Tony, she wanted to skate  
She was Picasso when she was on Paint  
Already nostalgic for the old days  
She wants to prove to her parents they were wrong  
She doesn’t care much about what’s after death  
She debates who the best Pokémon was  

[Bridge: Bigflo & Julien Doré]  
Burning the strings of her scoubidou (Ma-i-a hi)  
In the kitchen with Adibou (Ma-i-a hu)  

[Chorus: Bigflo, Oli & Julien Doré]  
It was better back then, rewind time, first gray hairs  
I’ve felt the weight of age  
It was better back then, rewind time, first gray hairs  
I’ve felt the weight of age  

[Post-Chorus: Bigflo, Oli & Julien Doré]  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
It was better back then  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I’ve felt the weight of age  

[Bridge: Julien Doré, Bigflo & Oli]  
Hélène, Lola, Lali, Josée  
The years pass on the podium of blues  
Pokémon, Titeuf, Beyblade, Diddl  
I broke you like Brice de Nice  
MSN, send me a wizz  
I’m talking about a time that those under twenty can’t know  
I’m talking about a time that those under twenty can’t know  
I’m talking about a time that those under twenty can’t know  
I’m talking about a time that those under twenty can’t know  

[Outro: Bigflo, Oli & Julien Doré]  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Woh, oh, oh, oh, oh
