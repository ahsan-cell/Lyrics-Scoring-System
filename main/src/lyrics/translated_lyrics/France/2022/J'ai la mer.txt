**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain]  
I have the sea above my soul  
I have the sea above my thoughts  
I have the sea above my dramas  
Anywhere on earth, if there’s the sea, we can stay  

[Verse 1]  
Go ahead, walk, step off the paths  
Let in the air from the whole world  
Don’t shy away, no, don’t shy away, no  
Come back to me sometimes to tell me  
I walked before you  
I haven’t seen it all, oh far from it  
But the little I know, oh, the little that I know, oh  
Come back to me, sometimes I’ll tell you  

[Refrain]  
I have the sea above my soul  
I have the sea above my thoughts  
I have the sea above my dramas  
Anywhere on earth, if there’s the sea, we can stay  

[Verse 2]  
Go ahead, dream, dance, sing and play  
That’s the sap that will make you grow  
That’s the reason, that’s how we respond  
To the question: “How do I feel good?”  
Here’s what I know about myself since I left far away  

[Refrain]  
I have the sea above my soul  
I have the sea above my thoughts  
I have the sea above my dramas  
Anywhere on earth, if there’s the sea, we can stay  
Anywhere on earth, if there’s the sea, we can stay  

[Bridge]  
If you don’t dare, you have a choice, you’ll feel the war within you  
If you don’t dare, you have a choice, you’ll feel the war within you  
If you don’t dare, you have a choice, you’ll feel the war within you  
If you don’t dare, whatever happens  

[Outro]  
You’ll have your father above your soul  
You’ll have your father above your thoughts  
You’ll have your father above your dramas  
Anywhere on earth, anywhere on earth  
Anywhere on earth, I will be your father  
Little bastard*
