**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain]  
Doctor, one day I will marry an angel  
We'll make love in the clouds  
Praying that nothing ever changes  
You know, a story rooted through the ages  
Doctor, one day I will marry an angel  
We'll make love in the clouds  
Praying that nothing ever changes  

[Verse 1]  
Here, love is far too superficial  
They keep telling you one day it will fall from the sky  
And it’s always the same old speeches  
Beautiful words, soon you'll run out (no)  

[Bridge]  
As soon as the day breaks  
I’ll go for a walk and I dream  
That nothing moves except our lips  
I rise (eh)  
As soon as the day breaks  
I’ll go for a walk and I dream  
Of a love that doesn’t exist  
Yet it will still sadden me  

[Refrain]  
Doctor, one day I will marry an angel  
We'll make love in the clouds  
Praying that nothing ever changes  
You know, a story rooted through the ages  
Doctor, one day I will marry an angel  
We'll make love in the clouds  
Praying that nothing ever changes, ever changes  

[Bridge]  
Here, love is far too conceptual  
They keep repeating that men and women are so cruel  
And it’s never like in the movies  
Indeed, we’re less beautiful away from the cameras  

[Verse 2]  
As soon as the day breaks  
I’ll go for a walk and I dream  
That nothing moves except our lips  
I rise (eh)  
As soon as the day breaks  
I’ll go for a walk and I dream  
Of a love that doesn’t exist  
Yet it will still sadden me  

[Refrain]  
Doctor, one day I will marry an angel  
We'll make love in the clouds  
Praying that nothing ever changes  
You know, a story rooted through the ages  
Doctor, one day I will marry an angel  
We'll make love in the clouds  
Praying that nothing ever changes, ever changes
