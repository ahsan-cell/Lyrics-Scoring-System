**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I would have spent days  
Making you love songs  
At the piano, all my scales  
With a pen, all my game  
Day after day after day  
I only know how to talk about love  
Always the same poem  
To declare my flame to you  

[Chorus]  
You make my flame shine  
All my pyromaniac heart  
You make my flame burn  
The spark of all my dramas  
You’ve reignited the flame  
And like never before, I’m burning  
Yes, like never before, I’m aflame  

[Verse 2]  
Under your balcony, in front of your tower  
I’ll know how to make you blush  
To sing my "I love you"  
I’ll never be too lazy  
In the game of love’s fires  
I give without thinking  
You don’t need your scales  
To play in my game  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s melodrama  
I declare my flame to you  

[Chorus]  
You make my flame shine  
All my pyromaniac heart  
You make my flame burn  
The spark of all my dramas  
You’ve reignited the flame  
And like never before, I’m burning  
Yes, like never before, I’m aflame  

[Bridge]  
You make my flame shine  
You make my flame burn  
You’ve reignited the flame  
And like never before, I’m burning  
Come, ah  
Come, ah  

[Chorus]  
You make my flame shine  
All my pyromaniac heart  
You make my flame burn  
The spark of all my dramas  
You’ve reignited the flame  
And like never before, I’m burning  
Yes, like never before, I’m aflame (Come)  
You make my flame shine  
All my pyromaniac heart  
You make my flame burn  
The spark of all my dramas  
You’ve reignited the flame  
And like never before, I’m burning  
Yes, like never before, I’m aflame (Come)  

[Outro]  
Also, don’t hold it against me  
If I only talk about this  
This feeling inside me  
Leaves me no choice  
I declare my flame to you  
Flame
