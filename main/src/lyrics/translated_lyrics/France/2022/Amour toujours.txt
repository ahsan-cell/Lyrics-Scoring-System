**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(A little, a lot, not at all)  
(A little, a lot, not at all)  
(A little, a lot, not at all)  
(A little, a lot, not at all)  
(A little, a lot)  
(A)

[Verse 1]  
True passions are islands made for two  
Castles with drawbridges always raised  
No one can enter  
A bachelor pad without a child's room  
There’s no space and there’s no time  
No one is invited

[Pre-Chorus]  
To madness (To madness)  
Passionately (To madness)  
A little, a lot, not at all  
Love forever but not for long  
To madness (To madness)  
Passionately  
A little, a lot, not at all  
Love forever

[Chorus]  
Which of the two will devour the other first?  
For to become one, you must leave  
A little, a little of yourself somewhere  
Which of the two will devour the other first?  
For to become one, you must leave  
A little, a little of yourself somewhere

[Verse 2]  
A bouquet of thorns received with closed eyes  
Arsenic in a bottle of scented water  
It’s a booby-trapped gift  
An arrow to the heart, it sounds nice in theory  
But we should learn to love without bleeding  
Cupid is merciless

[Pre-Chorus]  
To madness (To madness)  
Passionately  
A little, a lot, not at all  
Love forever but not for long  
To madness (To madness)  
Passionately  
A little, a lot, not at all  
Love forever

[Chorus]  
Which of the two will devour the other first?  
For to become one, you must leave  
A little, a little of yourself somewhere  
Which of the two will devour the other first?  
For to become one, you must leave  
A little, a little of yourself somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]  
To madness (To madness)  
Passionately (Not at all)  
A little, a lot, not at all  
Love forever but not for long  
To madness (To madness)  
Passionately (Not at all)  
A little, a lot, not at all  
Love forever

[Chorus]  
Which of the two will devour the other first?  
For to become one, you must leave  
A little, a little of yourself somewhere  
Which of the two will devour the other first?  
For to become one, you must leave  
A little, a little of yourself somewhere

[Outro]  
To madness (Not at all)  
To madness (Not at all)  
To madness (Not at all)  
To (Not at all)  
To madness (Not at all)  
To madness (Not at all)  
To madness (Not at all)  
To madness (Not at all)  
(A little, a lot, not at all)
