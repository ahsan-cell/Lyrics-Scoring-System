**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Ceuzany]  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  

[Verse 1: Christophe Maé]  
I found the land of wonders, darling  
Let’s go take some fresh air  
Come on, let’s go under the sun, darling  
Let’s go have a drink  
Yeah, life is like a cocktail, darling  
Sweet and bitter  
Let’s drink life from the bottle, darling  
Let’s go take some fresh air  
On the side of Cape Verde, on the side of Cape Horn  
Listening to the sea, listening to the morna*  
There are voices over there that travel, darling  
Pack some love in your luggage  

[Chorus: Ceuzany]  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  

[Verse 2: Christophe Maé]  
We are in the land of wonders, darling  
To life, to life  
In Cesária under the sun, darling  
Oh little country  
In the colors of Brazza, Brasero Brasil  
The fados, the beaches, a bit of Brazzaville  
There are voices here that travel, darling  
And love in their languages  

[Chorus: Ceuzany]  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  

[Bridge: Christophe Maé & Ceuzany]  
Little country, I love you so much  
Little, little, I love you so much  
Little country, I love you so much  
Little, little, I love you so much  

[Chorus: Ceuzany, Christophe Maé & Ceuzany]  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  
I believe in a paradise world  
Full of friendship and affection  
I love your simplicity  
Living in this world without malice  

[Outro: Christophe Maé, Christophe Maé & Ceuzany]  
I found the land of wonders, darling  
Little country, I love you so much  
Little, little, I love you so much
