**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
It’s worth it, just to see  
That we tip life a little  
So it serves us some hope  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
We won’t keep it on our shoulders  
But in the stars somewhere  
With a view of a funnier life  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We could prove melancholy wrong  
We could give reason to our sweet madness  
Your skin and my skin, that’s already harmony  
I love your soul as much as your anatomy  

[Chorus]  
Oh, come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
We’ll put suns in our eyes  
Because yesterday is already too old  
Because tomorrow is an illusion  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
Tonight we live life better  
Because yesterday is already too old  
Because tomorrow is an illusion  

[Verse 2]  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
We’ll find it again soon enough  
We’ll break down all our walls  
We’ll leave with a backpack  
Tell me if you’re ready tonight  
Body and heart in equal measure  
We forget that the sky is beautiful  
When we look too much at the sidewalks  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We could prove melancholy wrong  
The symphony of bodies sings sweet madness  
Your skin and my skin, that’s already harmony  
I love your soul as much as your anatomy  

[Bridge]  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
Come, let’s be stubborn tonight  
Come, let’s close our eyes  
Come, let’s close our eyes just to see  
Just to see  

[Chorus]  
Oh, come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
We’ll put suns in our eyes  
Because yesterday is already too old  
Because tomorrow is an illusion  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
Tonight we live life better  
Because yesterday is already too old  
Because tomorrow is an illusion  

[Chorus]  
Oh, come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
We’ll put suns in our eyes  
Because yesterday is already too old  
Because tomorrow is an illusion  
Come, let’s lose our minds tonight  
Tonight we live life better  
Because yesterday is already too old  
Because tomorrow is an illusion
