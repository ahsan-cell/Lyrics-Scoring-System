**[Verse 1]**  
I'm not the only one feeling alone  
At least that’s one less in my head  
And if I counted how many we are  
A lot  
All the things I've already thought about  
To think that many others have thought of them too  
But still, I feel all alone  
So it goes  

**[Chorus]**  
I've sometimes had suicidal thoughts, and I'm not proud of it  
Sometimes we think it's the only way to silence them  
These thoughts that make my life a hell  
These thoughts that make my life a hell  

**[Verse 2]**  
Am I the only one with a TV  
And the channel of guilt?  
But we need to clear our minds  
Not too much though  
Otherwise, it quickly comes back to haunt me  
And it’s too late for it to stop  
That’s when I wish I could forget everything  
So it goes  

**[Chorus]**  
I've sometimes had suicidal thoughts, and I'm not proud of it  
Sometimes we think it's the only way to silence them  
These thoughts that make my life a hell  
These thoughts that make my life a hell  

**[Verse 3]**  
You know, I've thought it through  
And I really don’t know what to do with you  
Exactly, thinking  
That’s the real problem with you  
You know, I've thought it through  
And I really don’t know what to do with you  
Exactly, thinking  
That’s the real problem with you
