**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You know, everyone around  
Could leave me  
As long as you're here, I'm fine, my love  
And don't forget that  
And even if in your world, everything is deaf  
Let me change it  
But when I love you, you doubt, my love  
I can't forget you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It screams, it breaks everything in the house  
Yet, we've counted the seasons  
You won't leave for no reason, no  

[Chorus]  
What are you talking about?  
In my head, it's just you and me  
The recipe is you and me  
We already know  
Why are you leaving?  
At the party, I only think of you  
The recipe is you and me  
Don't leave me  

[Post-Chorus]  
Don't leave me, I have you in my mind  
Don't leave me, you know, in my mind  
It's you and me  
Just you and me  

[Verse 2]  
And now, let's lay the cards on the table  
Give me valid reasons  
I would understand  
And now, tell me why all these fears  
But please, gently  
Because I would understand  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It screams, it breaks everything in the house  
Yet, we've counted the seasons  
You won't leave for no reason, no  

[Chorus]  
What are you talking about?  
In my head, it's just you and me  
The recipe is you and me  
We already know  
Why are you leaving?  
At the party, I only think of you  
The recipe is you and me  
Don't leave me  

[Post-Chorus]  
Don't leave me, I have you in my mind  
Don't leave me, you know, in my mind  
It's you and me  
Just you and me  

[Verse 3]  
You know, everyone around could leave me  
As long as you're here, I'm fine, my love  
Don't forget that  

[Bridge]  
What are you talking about?  
In my head, it's just you and me  
The recipe is you and me  
We already know  
Why are you leaving?  
At the party, I only think of you  
The recipe is you and me  
Don't leave me  

[Chorus]  
What are you talking about?  
In my head, it's just you and me  
The recipe is you and me  
We already know  
Why are you leaving?  
At the party, I only think of you  
The recipe is you and me  
Don't leave me  

[Post-Chorus]  
Don't leave me, I have you in my mind  
Don't leave me, you know, in my mind  
It's you and me  
Just you and me  

[Outro]  
Don't leave me
