**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Not everyone can forgive  
The wrong paths they've taken  
Even for a little thing  
Not everyone who loves  
Can tidy up the mistakes that linger  
Even just a bit  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I may have taken the wrong road  
We might have been mistaken, no doubt  
All of this is old  
It wasn't just us two  

[Chorus]  
Of course  
We cry a little  
To love each other better  
Being together isn't easy  
Of course  
Closing our eyes  
To the past  
Being together isn't easy  

[Post-Chorus]  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala lala  
(Being together isn't easy)  

[Verse 2]  
It's not easy to hold on for long  
But you often gave me a smile  
Infinitely (infinitely)  
It's not easy to brave the seas  
I'll be your lighthouse, your light  
If you get lost  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I may have been wrong sometimes  
We could have been wrong a hundred times  
All of this is old  
It wasn't just us two  

[Chorus]  
Of course  
We cry a little  
To love each other better  
Being together isn't easy  
Of course  
Closing our eyes  
To the past  
Being together isn't easy  

[Post-Chorus]  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala lala  
(Being together isn't easy)  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala lala  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I may have taken the wrong road  
We might have been mistaken, no doubt  
All of this is old  
It wasn't just us two  

[Chorus]  
Of course  
We cry a little  
To love each other better  
Being together isn't easy  
Of course  
Closing our eyes  
To the past  
Being together isn't easy  

[Post-Chorus]  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala lala  
(Being together isn't easy)  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala  
Palala, palala lala lala  
(Being together isn't easy)  

[Outro]  
It's not easy  
It's not easy  
Ah
