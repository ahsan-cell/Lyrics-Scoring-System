**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  

[Verse 1]  
She breathes in the scent of bodies  
Dancing around her in the dark  
They brush against each other without shyness  
A choreographed audacity  

[Pre-Chorus]  
She doesn’t want to sit down, she wants to forget herself  
She wants to be flirted with, to be looked at, and to be spun around  
She doesn’t want to sit down, it’s lasted too long  
The forced stillness, tonight life will begin again  

[Chorus]  
It has to move, it has to shake  
It has to sweat once more  
In the chaos of bars at night  
Disheveled in the dark  
We’ll have to relearn how to drink  
We’ll have to breathe again  
It has to move, it has to shake  
It has to sweat once more  
In the chaos of bars at night  
Disheveled in the dark  
We’ll have to relearn how to drink  
We’ll have to breathe again  

[Verse 2]  
Often her neck grazes the dance floor  
You think she falters, but she pulls through  
The rhythm of her heart  
Aligns with the strobe lights and beats a little harder  

[Pre-Chorus]  
She doesn’t want to sit down, she wants to forget herself  
She wants to be flirted with, to be looked at, and to be spun around  
She doesn’t want to sit down, it’s lasted too long  
The forced stillness, tonight life will begin again  

[Chorus]  
It has to move, it has to shake  
It has to sweat once more  
In the chaos of bars at night  
Disheveled in the dark  
We’ll have to relearn how to drink  
We’ll have to breathe again  
It has to move, it has to shake  
It has to sweat once more  
In the chaos of bars at night  
Disheveled in the dark  
We’ll have to relearn how to drink  
We’ll have to breathe again  

[Bridge]  
Come on, breathe again  
Come on, breathe again, come on, come on, come on, come on  
Come on, breathe again, come on, come on, come on  
Come on, breathe again, come on, come on, come on, come on  
Come on, breathe again, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on  

[Chorus]  
Oh, it has to move, it has to shake  
It has to sweat once more  
In the chaos of bars at night  
Disheveled in the dark  
We’ll have to relearn how to drink  
We’ll have to breathe again  
It has to move, it has to shake  
It has to sweat once more  
In the chaos of bars at night  
Disheveled in the dark  
We’ll have to relearn how to drink  
We’ll have to breathe again  

[Outro]  
Come on, breathe again  
Come on, breathe again  
Ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah
