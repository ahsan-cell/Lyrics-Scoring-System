**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
To those who have none  
To those who have none  

[Verse 1]  
Rosa, Rosa, when chaos reigns, you clean it up  
And you, Albert, when we toast, you pick up the glasses  
Céline (Céline), dear ('dear), you get left out in the cloakroom  
Arlette, stop it, you take the party to the restroom  

[Chorus]  
And what if we celebrated those who don’t celebrate?  
For once, I’d like to raise my glass to those who have none  
To those who have none  

[Verse 2]  
What about good manners? Why should I pretend?  
Anyway, she’s paid to do it, do you think you’re my mother?  
I’ll be back in an hour, make sure it’s clean, so we can eat off the floor, I’ve been waiting three hours  
Honestly, do they even make them or what? Luckily, it’s just two glasses  
Call me your manager and hurry up, your career could end like this  

[Chorus]  
Yes, let’s celebrate those who don’t celebrate  
Once again, I’d like to raise my glass to those who have none  
To those who have none  
To those who have none  

[Bridge]  
Rub, rub, better not get too close, rub if you don’t know me  
Brush, brush, you can always brush it off, brush if you don’t respect me  

[Chorus]  
Yes, let’s celebrate those who don’t celebrate  
Once again, I’d like to raise my glass to those who have none  
To those who have none  

[Outro]  
Pilot or nurse, truck driver or flight attendant  
Baker or fisherman, a toast to the champions of the worst hours  
To young parents rocked by cries, to the professionals of insomnia  
And all those who suffer from heartache, who aren’t in the mood for celebrations  
Who aren’t in the mood for celebrations
