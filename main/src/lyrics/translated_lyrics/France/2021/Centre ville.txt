**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The lights appear  
My nights in the city center  
Those among castaways  
Of connections in neon signs  
It rains like me, I bleed  
My nights in the city center  
It's a censored film  
At the hour I awaken  
You slip naked under the sheets  

[Chorus]  
While I go out when the city sleeps  
And kiss girls who speak loudly  
We raise our glasses to the light  
We dance until the little death  
Of all this time that dies when we sleep  
What I know will never return  

[Verse 2]  
The lights appear  
My nights in the city center  
Are white and dimmed  
No one calls for me  
No one blames me anymore  
My nights in the city center  
It's a life on the sidelines  
At the hour I ignite  
You slip naked under the sheets  

[Chorus]  
While I go out when the city sleeps  
And embrace girls who speak loudly  
We raise our glasses to the light  
We dance until the little death  
Of all this time that bursts while we dream  
What I know will never return  

[Bridge]  
You slip naked under the sheets  
While I go out when the city sleeps  
And kiss girls who speak loudly  
We raise our glasses to the light  
We dance until the little death  

[Chorus]  
While I go out when the city sleeps  
And kiss girls who speak loudly  
We raise our glasses to the light  
We dance until the little death  
Of all this time that flows easily, peacefully  
What I know will never return  

[Outro]  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
