**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You know, life is worth nothing  
If your eyes aren't looking into mine  
Oh, I struggle to make the connection  
I grow pale without your hands  
Oh, I’d give everything for you  
I’ll give you my body and then my voice  
Oh, I could steal everything, I think  
I offer you my gold and then my joy  

[Chorus]  
I love you, what do we do? I love you  
More than you love me, I love you  
How do we dress the sky in the color of our veins?  
Will you love me? Will you understand?  
What people mean who live recklessly  
I love you without reason, I love you to the point of foolishness  
I love you in my own way, and even after, I will love you  
And even after, I will love you  

[Verse 2]  
You know often, I hold back  
You could be my great sorrow  
With every wound, it dims my day  
I would even offer you my two kidneys  
Oh, I could burn everything for you  
So that finally, only I remain  
Oh, I could even break my cross  
Anyway, I only believe in you  

[Chorus]  
I love you, what do we do? I love you  
More than you love me, I love you  
How do we dress the sky in the color of our veins?  
Will you love me? Will you understand?  
What people mean who live recklessly  
I love you without reason, I love you to the point of foolishness  
I love you in my own way, and even after, I will love you  
And even after, I will love you  

[Outro]  
And even after, I will love you  
And even after, and even after, I will love you  
And even after, I will love you  
I will love you
