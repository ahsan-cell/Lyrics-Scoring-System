**[Verse 1]**  
Look at me as I am, a heart and two fists  
I live, I want, I forget, just like you, no more, no less  
See how I scream, how I laugh out loud  
I run, I create, I shine, I know, I don’t know how  
You want a man, you want a father  
You tell me "Slow down," you tell me "Speed up"  
And the more I follow you, the more I lose myself  
Tell me, tell me, what does it mean for you  

**[Chorus]**  
A man, at worst, at best lost  
A man, what is it, I don’t know, I can’t say anymore  
Look into my eyes, what do you see?  
Tell me, what is a man, what’s a man to you?  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
A bit tough, a bit fragile  
A bit free, a bit docile  
A bit strong, a bit sensitive  
A bit crazy, a bit calm  
A man, at worst, at best lost  
A man, what is it, I don’t know, I can’t say anymore  

**[Verse 2]**  
I change, I try, I launch and I move forward  
I find space, I create other places  
I follow you, I invent, I reinvent myself  
I am, I fade away, fire and ice  
I want to be a brother, a buddy, a lover  
A lighthouse, a guide, and I want just as much  
And the more I desire, the more I lose myself  
If you know, tell me, what does it mean for you  

**[Chorus]**  
A man, at worst, at best lost  
A man, what is it, I don’t know, I can’t say anymore  
Look into my eyes, what do you see?  
Tell me, what is a man, what’s a man to you?  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
A bit tough, a bit fragile  
A bit free, a bit docile  
A bit strong, a bit sensitive  
A bit crazy, a bit calm  
A bit of nothing, a bit of madness  
A bit far, a bit here  
A bit of a dreamer, a bit of gloom  
A bit playful, a bit clean  
A bit up high, a bit cold  
A bit warm, a bit lower  
A bit of ego, a bit dirty  
A bit of a scoundrel, a bit calm  
A bit of innocence, a bit of vice  
A bit of a dad, a bit of crisis  
A bit of nature, a bit of class  
A bit or not fitting in the boxes  

**[Outro]**  
A man, at worst, at best lost  
A man, what is it, I don’t know, I can’t say anymore  
Look into my eyes, what do you see?  
Tell me, what is a man, what’s a man to you?  
A man, at worst, at best lost  
A man, what is it, I don’t know, I can’t say anymore  
Look into my eyes, what do you see?  
Tell me, what is a man, what’s a man to you?
