**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Let me tell you a couple of silly things, before you make a mistake  
The problem with life is that there’s only one to live  
We’ll never cure depression like we cure a cold  
But just know you can count on me for as long as it lasts  
Allergic to life, mornings are dark when everything tastes like déjà vu  
Nights are black, everyone has abandoned you, even the moon  
But the end of the desert might be hiding behind every dune  

**[Chorus]**  
Everything will be alright, that’s a lie, I know you know  
Sometimes I won’t know what to say, but I can always listen  
Not everything will change, well, unless you do  
When you have a desert to cross, there’s nothing to do but move forward  
Nothing to do but move forward  
We’ll laugh about it when we see it in a better light  
Better light, better light  
We’ll laugh about it when we see it in a better light  
Better light, better light, better light  

**[Unique Verse]**  
Like in all those pop songs where the girls have left  
Like in all those rap tracks where all your friends have betrayed you  
Sometimes you need support, sometimes you need a friend  
Sometimes you need to feel anger, sometimes you need an enemy  
In truth, you can’t control everything, you have to accept that  
Being happy is like everything else, you first have to learn to be, I know  
You go to bed saying tomorrow I’ll do it, you wake up saying tomorrow I’ll do it, my friend
