**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's the end  
The very last morning  
The very last jasmine  
Don't let go of my hand  
It's the end  
The sun in the distance  
Falls alone in its corner  
Don't let go, I’m holding you tight  

[Chorus]  
The last day of disco  
I want to spend it on your skin  
Blushing like a poppy  
The last day of disco  
I want to hear it in stereo  
And tell you there's nothing more beautiful  

[Verse 2]  
It's the end  
The bronze statues  
Melt in their sorrow  
Don't let go of my hand  
It's the end  
The rivers of fate  
Frenzy like satin  
Don't let go  
I’m holding you tight  

[Chorus]  
The last day of disco  
I want to spend it on your skin  
Blushing (ah, ah) like a poppy (like a poppy)  
The last day of disco  
I want to hear it in stereo  
And tell you (ah, ah) there's nothing more beautiful (there's nothing more beautiful)  

[Verse 3]  
It's the end  
The colors suddenly  
Blend like charcoal  
Don't let go, it’s nothing  
It's the end  
I see in the drawing  
Something divine  
Your Eden, my garden  

[Chorus]  
The last day of disco  
I want to spend it on your skin  
Blushing (ah, ah) like a poppy (like a poppy)  
The last day of disco (last day of disco)  
I want to hear it in stereo  
And tell you (ah, ah) there's nothing more beautiful (there's nothing more beautiful)  

[Bridge]  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  
The last day of disco  

[Chorus]  
The last day of disco  
I want to spend it on your skin  
Blushing (ah, ah) like a poppy (like a poppy)  
The last day of disco (last day of disco)  
I want to hear it in stereo  
And tell you (ah, ah) there's nothing more beautiful (there's nothing more beautiful)  

[Outro]  
It's the end
