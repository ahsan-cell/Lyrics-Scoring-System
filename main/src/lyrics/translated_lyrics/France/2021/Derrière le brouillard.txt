**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain: Louane]  
And in the dark, behind the fog, I hear that piano singing  
Singing of hope, the desire to believe that we can reinvent everything  
So, I join my voice once more to hold on through the storm  
I join my voice once more to find the courage  

[Verse 1: Grand Corps Malade]  
There’s no recipe for enduring trials  
To swim against the current when tragedies rain down  
There’s no recipe for bearing the dramas  
Crossing seas with a paddle when horror charms you  
There’s no recipe when you didn’t have one before  
No one warned you, you fought as best you could  
There’s no recipe when hell shakes your hand  
Giving up is human; the future feels far away  
But you started to sing, not even by choice  
Like every fall, each time, it imposed itself on you  
Singing like a surprised child, like a survival instinct, like a moment of fury  
Singing to accept, express, resist, move forward, progress, exist  
Singing like resilience, like liberation  
Singing like it’s self-evident  

[Refrain: Louane]  
And in the dark, behind the fog, I hear that piano singing  
Singing of hope, the desire to believe that we can reinvent everything  
So, I join my voice once more to hold on through the storm  
I join my voice once more to find the courage  

[Verse 2: Grand Corps Malade]  
At what moment do you realize it’s your thing?  
That music comes back to lift you from every fall  
At what moment do you know it’s your compass?  
When life punishes you, music consoles you  
At what moment did that piano sing?  
Its chords haunted you, nurtured your health  
At what moment does it become your breath?  
And at what moment do we turn it into a song?  

[Verse 3: Louane & Grand Corps Malade]  
If I feel like a child, I’ve already lived several lives  
I can look ahead, singing what was taken from me  
I too have known a kind of fog and I heard that piano in the distance  
And I too, without really expecting it, naturally, my voice joins in  
We don’t have the same stories at all, but in the end, some common points  
Like a hint of oratory strength, I write, you sing, the fog is far behind  

[Refrain: Louane]  
And in the dark, behind the fog, I hear that piano singing  
Singing of hope, the desire to believe that we can reinvent everything  
So, I join my voice once more to hold on through the storm  
I join my voice once more to find the courage
