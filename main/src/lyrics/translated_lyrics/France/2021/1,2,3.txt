**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain: Amel Bent & Hatik]  
Tired of being the only one to say "I love you"  
I wonder if one day you'll say it too  
Yes, my heart is hanging on your lips  
Just tell me  
1, 2, 3  
Look at me, loving you without moving my lips  
Rest assured, I'll be fine even with a heart of a pirate  
It doesn't change anything if I tell you that I love you  
So, I won't say it, no  
1, 2, 3  

[Verse 1: Amel Bent]  
I feel it, I sense it, I see it but I can't hear it  
You ask me to follow you but I don't know where you're going  
How long must I endure, hearing you say you're like this?  
Your answers don't satisfy me  
I'll end up asking the wrong questions  
Silence is golden, yes, it doesn't make you right  
Before I hear it, tell me how many seasons (How many seasons)  
How many seasons?  
No, no, no  

[Refrain: Amel Bent & Hatik]  
Tired of being the only one to say "I love you"  
I wonder if one day you'll say it too  
Yes, my heart is hanging on your lips  
Just tell me  
1, 2, 3  
Look at me, loving you without moving my lips  
Rest assured, I'll be fine even with a heart of a pirate  
It doesn't change anything if I tell you that I love you  
So, I won't say it, no  
1, 2, 3  

[Verse 2: Hatik]  
You want the life of a princess (princess)  
But, my dear, I'm going to speak to you in French (French, French, French)  
You tell me you love me with hesitation  
Yet I'm always sincere  
You and me until death  
I don't need to speak, I love you silently  
I want to offer you a world away from financial troubles  
But you ask for love as if I wasn't giving you any  
You love words, I love actions, watch out for false starts  
I don't care about having a kingdom if you're not my queen  
I love you in silence, you're in my dreams from morning till night  
You cling to illusions, baby, you're living in a dream (in a dream)  
It's not that I don't love you, it's just that you don't want to see it  
No, no, no, no, no, no (no, no, no)  
No, no, no, no, no, no (no, no, no)  
No, no, no, no, no, no  

[Refrain: Amel Bent & Hatik]  
Tired of being the only one to say "I love you"  
I wonder if one day you'll say it too  
Yes, my heart is hanging on your lips  
Just tell me  
1, 2, 3  
Look at me, loving you without moving my lips  
Rest assured, I'll be fine even with a heart of a pirate  
It doesn't change anything if I tell you that I love you  
So, I won't say it, no  
1, 2, 3  

[Bridge: Amel Bent & Hatik]  
I'll give you everything, you're my foundation  
And no matter what happens  
For you, I could take a bullet, bullet, bullet  
I don't like seeing you in pain  
For you, I love you, it's normal  
But for me, it's just a detail, detail, detail  
I'll give you everything, you're my foundation  
And no matter what happens  
For you, I could take a bullet, bullet, bullet  
I don't like seeing you in pain  
For you, I love you, it's normal  
But for me, it's just a detail, detail, detail  

[Refrain: Amel Bent & Hatik]  
Tired of being the only one to say "I love you"  
I wonder if one day you'll say it too  
Yes, my heart is hanging on your lips  
Just tell me  
1, 2, 3  
Look at me, loving you without moving my lips  
Rest assured, I'll be fine even with a heart of a pirate  
It doesn't change anything if I tell you that I love you  
So, I won't say it, no  
1, 2, 3  

[Outro: Hatik]
