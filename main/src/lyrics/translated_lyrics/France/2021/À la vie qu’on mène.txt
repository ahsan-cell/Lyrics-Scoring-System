**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I was the child playing in the trees  
I had the time, my hair all messy  
There was the wind  
There was the sand  
Simply the normal life  
There are the kids, two little monsters  
And it’s funny how time flies by  
There are people sitting at my table  
This is now the normal life  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Simply  
Facing the challenges, even if it always feels real  
Simply  
I found the girl, no time to doubt  

[Chorus]  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
To the life we lead  

[Verse 2]  
No time to complain, we’re strong  
Even if I go to bed late, I wake up early  
Half in the train but my feet in the water  
Nights at the hotel, evenings with friends  
You know I miss you and you’re there when I stumble  
You’re my engine, my baby, my family  
Half in the train but my hands in yours  
You’re my guide, my treasure, my siren  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Simply  
Facing the challenges, even if it always feels real  
Simply  
I found the girl, no time to doubt  

[Chorus]  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
To the life we lead  

[Bridge]  
There will be hearts, courage  
Shouts, friends passing by  
There will be hearts, courage  
Simply  
Come see life for real  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Simply  
Facing the challenges  
Even if it always feels real  
Simply  
I found the girl, no time to doubt  

[Chorus]  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
To the life we lead  

[Outro]  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead  
Simply  
I’ll let you taste  
To the life we lead
