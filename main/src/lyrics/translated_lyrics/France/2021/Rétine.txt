**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It started from nothing  
Barely a glance exchanged  
We were two, two strangers  
Who knew each other well  
It began from afar  
I didn’t want to reveal myself  
But you stole my shyness  
The sky is our witness  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
How many days, how many joys  
It doesn’t really matter if we don’t know  
Since a second by your side is worth many years  
How many days, how many people  
Will say that we love stubbornly  
But it amuses me, my muse  
We’re not close to fading  

[Chorus]  
If in your retina, love  
Can no longer bear the light of day  
I will reignite the stars around  
I’ll learn to count to forever  
And you, you can count on me  

[Post-Chorus]  
And it will never end  
It will never end  
It will never end  
And it will never end  
It will never end  
It will never end  

[Verse 2]  
I know we fit well  
Like sweet lips and salty skin  
Like when our bodies let go  
The ocean is our witness  
And I love your quirks, our magic  
Your way of being my friend  
I’m not superstitious  
But you’re the luck of my life  
And if tomorrow we had nothing left  
I wouldn’t say "goodbye," but "thank you"  
For leaving in my storms  
A beautiful clearing  

[Chorus]  
If in your retina, love can no longer bear the light of day  
I will reignite the stars around  
I’ll learn to count to forever  
And you, you can count on me  

[Post-Chorus]  
And it will never end  
It will never end  
It will never end  
And it will never end  
It will never end  
It will never end  

[Interlude]  
It will end, end  
It will end, finished  

[Outro]  
If in your retina, love can no longer bear the light of day  
I will reignite the stars around  
I’ll learn to count to forever  
And you, you can count on me
