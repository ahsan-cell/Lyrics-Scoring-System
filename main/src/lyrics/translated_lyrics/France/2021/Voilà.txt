**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Listen to me, I, the half-singer  
Talk about me, to your loves, to your friends  
Tell them about this girl with dark eyes and her wild dream  
What I want is to write stories that reach you  
That's all  

[Chorus 1]  
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am, this is who I am  
Here I am, even if laid bare, I'm scared, yes  
Here I am in the noise and in the silence  

[Verse 2]  
Look at me, or at least what's left of me  
Look at me, before I start to hate myself  
What can I say that another's lips won't tell you?  
It's little things, but everything I have, I lay it here  
Here it is  

[Chorus 2]  
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am, this is who I am  
Here I am, even if laid bare, it's over  
This is my face, this is my cry, here I am, so be it  
Here I am, here I am, right here  
Me, my dream, my desire, as I suffer for it, as I laugh about it  
Here I am in the noise and in the silence  

[Verse 3]  
Don't leave, I beg you, stay a while  
It might not save me, no  
But I don't know how to do without you  
Love me like you love a friend who's leaving forever  
I want to be loved, because I don't know how to love my own edges  

[Chorus 3]  
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I am, this is who I am  
Here I am, even if laid bare, it's over  
Here I am in the noise and in the fury too  
Finally look at me, and my eyes and my hands  
Everything I have is here, this is my face, this is my cry  
Here I am, here I am, here I am  
Here I am, here I am  
Here I am, here I am  

[Outro]  
[Vocalizations]  
Here I am
