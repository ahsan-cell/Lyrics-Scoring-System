**[Verse 1]**  
Even without tasting, even without doubting  
You'll say that you love me, but you don't really mean it  
Even without tasting, even without doubting  
You'll say that you don't love me, and you'll grow tired  
But I, I blamed myself, I, I blamed myself, I, I blamed myself  
But what do you think? That I enjoy being against you?  
I, I suspected, I, I suspected, I, I suspected  
You'll leave, like all the other men before you  

**[Chorus]**  
You'll leave my arms  
You'll leave like all the other men before you  
I didn't expect you to be that way  
But you'll grow up like all the other men before you  

**[Verse 2]**  
I feel stifled, struggling to express myself  
I can't find the words, the times I say too much  
Might as well tell you I'm expecting the worst  
Is it my fault? Is it yours or the others'?  
I, I doubted, I doubted so much, I doubted too much  
I've lost faith in the love of days gone by  
I, I've been consumed by darkness from fearing  
That you'll leave like all the other men before you  

**[Chorus]**  
You'll leave my arms  
You'll leave like all the other men before you  
I didn't expect you to be that way  
But you'll grow up like all the other men before you  

**[Bridge]**  
It's too much effort, it's devouring me  
Nothing changes except the scenery  
I no longer have the strength to say "goodbye"  
All this for you, all this for what?  
To put me in such a state  
No, you shouldn't have come to see me  

**[Chorus]**  
You'll leave my arms  
You'll leave like all the other men before you  
I didn't expect you to be that way  
But you'll grow up like all the other men before you
