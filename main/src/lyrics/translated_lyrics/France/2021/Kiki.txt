**Translated Lyrics:**

From my heart, you fall  
Tell me if you know  
How to stand in your shadow  
How to hold onto their ideas  
It's fear that rumbles  
Tell me if it's true  
That we've broken the world  
That we have the last ticket  

**[Chorus 1]**  
But you'll have your style  
Like Kylian Mbappé  
And you'll be free  
If you're not too tired  

You won't see any tigers  
Nor people loving each other  
They were too fragile  
They said it on TV  

**[Verse 2]**  
From my heart, you dive  
Tell me if you know  
How to count the seconds  
Without falling into the abyss  
It's fear that screams  
That you need to whisper  
To make yourself heard  
Without drawing too much attention  

**[Chorus 1]**  
But you'll have your style  
Like Kylian Mbappé  
And you'll be free  
If you're not too tired  

You won't see any tigers  
Nor people loving each other  
They were too fragile  
They said it on TV  

They said it on TV  

**[Verse 3]**  
But whatever happens  
At least you know  
All of this hangs by a thread  
That we've unwound poorly  
You know it's shame  
That serves as my paper  
I drew your grave  
Before even rocking you  

**[Chorus 2]**  
And if it resonates  
And if tomorrow pleases you  
You'll have to forgive  
We were tired  
And if it resonates  
And if tomorrow pleases you  
You'll have to forgive  
We were tired  

**[Outro]** x4  
We're not tired
