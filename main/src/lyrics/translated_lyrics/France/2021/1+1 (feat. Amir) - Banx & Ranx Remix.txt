**Translated Lyrics:**

Get a girl, or get a boy  
One plus one  
Take them right down to the shore  
One plus one  
Give your all and give some more  
One plus one  
Let the music free your soul (Yeah, Banx & Rank)  

[Pre-Chorus: Sia]  
Sway with me to the light  
Hold me for just one night  
Hold me for just one night (Whoah)  
We live for the beat  
Baby, you're all I need  
Baby, you're all I need (Ohh)  

[Chorus: Amir, Amir & Sia, Sia]  
All the sounds that will bloom  
One plus one  
From our multicolored souls  
One plus one  
Facing the irony of fate  
Without effort  
Could bring us to an agreement  
One plus one  
You can dance however you want  
Under the sun when it rains  
Under the sun when it rains  
It's true if you imagine  
Every day's a holiday  
Let the beat take you away  
Let the beat take you today  
Baby, this is magic  

[Verse 2: Amir]  
If together we are stronger  
One plus one  
And if our eyes still shine  
One plus one  
I really think I want your voice  
One plus one  
I'm sure that I want you  
One plus one  

[Pre-Chorus: Amir, Sia]  
All the coordinates  
Of my heart are given  
Of love are given (Oh)  
The night will fade away  
Don't let me go away  
Don't let me go away (Oh)  

[Chorus: Sia, Sia & Amir, Amir]  
So I'm taking you away  
One plus one  
Every day's a holiday  
One plus one  
Move your body, feel the sway  
Grab someone  
Every day's a holiday  
One plus one  
Every day's a holiday  
Let the beat take you away  
Let the beat take you today  
Baby, this is magic  
You can dance however you want  
Under the sun when it rains  
Under the sun when it rains  
It's true if you imagine  

[Bridge: Sia]  
Every day's a holiday  
One plus one  
Let the beat take you today  
One plus one  

[Chorus: Amir, Amir & Sia]  
All the sounds that will bloom  
One plus one  
From our multicolored souls  
One plus one  
Facing the irony of fate  
Without effort  
Could bring us to an agreement  
One plus one  
You can dance however you want  
Under the sun when it rains  
Under the sun when it rains  
It's true if you imagine  
You can dance however you want  
Under the sun when it rains  
Under the sun when it rains  
It's true if you imagine
