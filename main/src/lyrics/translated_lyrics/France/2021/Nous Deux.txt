**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In the end, it doesn't matter where I'll be tomorrow  
There's only one dream in my eyes  
So many destinies and so many paths  
Just one moment right before my eyes  

And then, what does it matter if everything fades within me?  
But I know everything is written deep in the ether  
If there's a world where everything fades, within me lies a truth  
So many dreams where I hear music playing, hidden away  

[Chorus]  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both at once  

Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both at once  

[Verse 2]  
Well beyond our reality  
Well beyond all our markers  
There’s a cry in the vastness  
There’s an anthem around the Earth  
And then, what does it matter if everything fades within me?  
But I know everything is written deep in the ether  
If there's a world where everything fades, within me lies a truth  
So many dreams where I hear music playing, hidden away  

[Chorus]  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both at once  

Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both at once  

[Bridge]  
A little bit of us in this air  
A little bit of us in this dream for two  
A little bit of us in this air  
A little bit of us in this dream for two  

Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both  

[Chorus]  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both at once  

Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams of us both at once  

[Outro]  
A little bit of us in this air  
A little bit of us in this dream for two  
A little bit of us in this air  
A little bit of us in this dream for two  

Behind each of my steps  
So many dreams and so much of you  
Behind each of my steps
