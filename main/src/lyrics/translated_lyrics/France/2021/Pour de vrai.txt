**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I wasn't the same on Friday  
You hadn't crossed my life either  
I wasn't the same, shouting in the rain  
I waited for you, you see, and since then  
It's not tomorrow that I'll curse the alarm  
And wake me up if I don't marvel  
At the life we have  
As long as we live together  
Not tomorrow that I'll curse the sun  
Because the sun is you  
And I'm solemn for once  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m not laughing, oh oh  
We can see the world in miniature  
Or love each other for a lifetime  

[Chorus]  
I’m not laughing  
We can see the world in miniature  
I will love you for real  
For real  
You're all that I have  
For real  
You're all that I have  

[Verse 2]  
Will we be the same our whole lives?  
Still laughing and sharing the same desires  
We'll make the times lie, we'll leave Paris  
Then I'll sing "En Cloque" while waiting for the little one  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m not laughing, oh oh  
We can see the world in miniature  
Or love each other for a lifetime  

[Chorus]  
I’m not laughing  
We can see the world in miniature  
I will love you for real  
For real  
You're all that I have  
For real  
You're all that I have  

[Verse 3]  
And the punches, the aging blows  
I want us to take them together  
Say the punches, the aging blows  
I want us to take them together  
And the punches, the aging blows  
I want us to take them together  
Say the punches, the aging blows  
I want us to take them together  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m not laughing, oh, oh  
We can see the world in miniature  
Or love each other for a lifetime  

[Chorus]  
I’m not laughing  
We can see the world in miniature  
I will love you for real  
For real  
You're all that I have  
For real  
You're all that I have
