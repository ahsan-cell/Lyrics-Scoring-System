**Translated Lyrics:**

Eh, eh I smoke shishas like Zifou, thirty years old, I feel on top like Zizou  
2020: I finally have my Grünt, by 2030, I'll be on Autopsy 12  
I hang out with tough guys, Cartier glasses, the frame is gold  
Among rappers, I'm known like a killer's name but they struggle to say it like a Turkish name  
My little brother chose dirty money, I don't know how to tell him I disagree  
When he comes out of jail, I hug him but insult him when he leaves my room and doesn't close the door  
What a paradox, he told me: "Five years, it's not the end"  
In the hood, you get called gay when your friend manages a girl and you can't handle her friend, huh  
So I managed her friend, we checked each other out at night, she must have liked me  
Unlike the other one, she has a heart, we'll see each other at the hour of secrets and affairs  
She's beautiful, hot, and tattooed, with girls, I think I'm not skilled  
She put on her best outfit to see me, I check that my pants aren't torn, woof  
All my childhood spent making remarks  
I want the Arabs to respect me like their fathers  
I want the Black folks to respect me like their Air Max peers  
French rap cost me a lot, it's a trap, I'm disgusted, damn  
Your mother told you it wasn't a job, hey buddy, you should always listen to your mother, makes sense  

[Chorus: Limsa]  
Dream team of the ghetto, outside, they’re smoking weed  
From the hood, it’s all about the hustle, it’s the dream team of the ghetto  
Outside, they’re smoking weed, eh, smoking weed  
From Aulnay to Juvisy, you know what’s up  

[Bridge: Limsa]  
Yo my guy Lesram  

[Verse 2: Lesram]  
On a scooter without a helmet, two of us, like stuntmen, I’m doing 4-4-2  
There are a bunch of losers, come on, roll your weed, I can see myself on the coast in a blue 4x4  
There are all those who talk about us but we don’t talk about them, they play the tough guys, but really, they’re cowards  
Now, I see myself as a kid with my backpack, I never imagined this hustler life  
Hey, my buddy, tell me what you did to deserve so much bad luck, such a cruel life  
At night, we cruise, speeding through the city, the girl got in, she peed on herself  
There’s the golden youth with their noses in powder, noses all white, they sleep well  
You noticed they have more than you but still, they give less  
You have a ceiling, you’re a chatterbox, don’t forget your buddy, the profit, you divide by two  
Meeting in front of Histoire d'Or, they went to mess it up just for fun  
3.1.0 burns a joint, there’s some hash and weed, often we complain but we’re too excessive  
They told me wake up, you’re too in your bubble, at the studio, you’re not pro when you’ve drunk  
I’m angry, I’m angry, I’m mad at the whole world, need to add gold to my dentures  
There are remnants of rappers in my ashtray, gotta act when problems just worsen, bastard  
Limsa, Lesram, it’s light, bastard  

[Chorus: Limsa]  
It’s the dream team of the ghetto  
(Hey, I’m sending a little chorus for the road, come on)  
Dream team of the ghetto, outside, they’re smoking weed  
From the hood, it’s all about the hustle  
From the hood, it’s all about the hustle, it’s the dream team of the ghetto  
Outside, they’re smoking weed, eh  
From the hood, it’s all about the hustle  
From Aulnay to Juvisy, you know what’s up  
Woof woof woof woof  

[Bridge: Limsa]  
Bro FA  

[Verse 3: FA2L]  
I speak little when I’m not interested, you think of God but only when you need  
You’re worth nothing like a deputy mayor, only in your head are you a star  
Yeah, I don’t give a damn about prestige, boy, there’s too much nonsense in history books  
The benefits of colonies don’t exist, I’ve always seen music as an outlet  
And in this mess, I’m doing well, I’m far from having the worst sorbet  
Look around you, the world is sordid,
