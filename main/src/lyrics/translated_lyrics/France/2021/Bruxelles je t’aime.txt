**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We don’t have the towers of New York, we don’t have daylight  
Six months of the year  
We don’t have Beaubourg or the Seine, we’re not the city of love  
But well, you see  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And surely by tonight the sky will cover with a storm  
But after the rain, with some beers, people will celebrate  

[Chorus]  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
I missed you  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
You’re my favorite  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
I missed you  
You’re the most beautiful, yes, you’re the most beautiful (Hey)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Paris calls me when I want to go home  
When the gray sky and the rain are missed, I feel better when I see you  
Cities are beautiful, but I only think of you  
When I miss my country and my city, I don’t forget you  

[Verse 2]  
We don’t have the longest of all stories  
We know it, we haven’t always won  
And usually, I have the attitude, even if it’s hard to keep hope  
When we’re not the first  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The Marolles, Flagey, Saint-Gilles, Laeken, to whom I owe my name  

[Chorus]  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
I missed you  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
You’re my favorite  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
I missed you  
You’re the most beautiful, yes, you’re the most beautiful (Hey, oh-oh)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Paris calls me when I want to go home  
When the gray sky and the rain are missed, I feel better when I see you  
Cities are beautiful, but I only think of you  
When I miss my country and my city, I don’t forget you  

[Verse 3]  
And if one day it separates and we have to choose a side  
It would be the worst nightmare, all for a matter of languages  
I’ve lived my most beautiful stories in French and in Flemish  
Let me say it in Flemish, thank you Brussels for my name  
And if one day it separates and we have to choose a side  
It would be the worst nightmare, all for a matter of languages  
I’ve lived my most beautiful stories in French and in Flemish  
Let me say it in Flemish, thank you Brussels (Hey, oh-oh)  

[Chorus]  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
I missed you  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
You’re my favorite  
Brussels, I love you, Brussels, I love you  
I missed you  
You’re the most beautiful, yes, you’re the most beautiful (Oh-oh)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Paris calls me (Paris calls me) when I want to go home (Oh-oh)  
When the gray sky and the rain are missed (Oh-oh), I feel better when I see you  
Cities are beautiful (Cities are beautiful), but I only think of you (Oh-oh)  
When I miss my country and my city, I don’t forget you (Oh-oh)  
Paris calls me (Paris calls me) when I want to go home (Oh-oh)  
When the gray sky and the rain are missed (Oh-oh), I feel better when I see you  
Cities are beautiful (Cities are beautiful), but I only think of you (Oh-oh)  
When I miss my country and my city, I (Oh-oh) don’t forget you
