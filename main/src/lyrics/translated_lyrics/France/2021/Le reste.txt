**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I'm just a fool lying on my back  
Replaying the film, the beginning was beautiful  
Then I picture you playing on your piano  
A melody fades into an echo  
I've ruined everything, I know  
I know, I've ruined everything  

[Bridge]  
I can't forget your body and the lost beauty mark  
On your thumb, and the skin on your back  
The rest, I leave to you but I hold on tight  
To the emotional memory of your naked body  

[Chorus]  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  

[Verse 2]  
I feel you from afar, chasing our memories that still pulse  
That will soon fade away  
Is it my poor heart that invented it all?  
Were you here, did you at least love me?  
I've ruined everything, I know  
I know, I've ruined everything  

[Chorus]  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  

[Bridge]  
I can't forget your body and the lost beauty mark  
On your thumb, and the skin on your back  
The rest, I leave to you but I hold on tight  
To the emotional memory of your naked body  

[Verse 3]  
I'm still in love with an idea that's fading  
Frozen forever in a flawless mirror  
From where I watch you come out wonderfully  
Spying on your happiness makes it less cruel for me  

[Chorus]  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  

[Bridge]  
I can't forget your body and the lost beauty mark  
On your thumb, and the skin on your back  
The rest, I leave to you but I hold on tight  
To the emotional memory of your naked body  

[Outro]  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh  
The rest, I leave to you, oh, oh
