**Translated Lyrics:**

I have Vesuvius deep in my veins  
Aaah, she is so beautiful  
The pain that calls to me  

The most beautiful blow that life delivers  
The finest setting, bodies playing the scene  
I’m so dizzy, I can barely hold on  
But these desires keep me here  

And I run, my heart going back and forth  
It’s the first time  
I found a ticket for her  
In this carousel  

And I run, my heart going back and forth  
It’s the first time  
I found a ticket for her  
In this carousel  

In this carousel, in this, in this carousel  
In this carousel, in this, in this carousel  

I’m not playing, it’s not a game  
You commit when you love me  
You’ll have to protect me  
Until my last breath  

I run, my heart going back and forth  
It’s the first time  
I finally found what matters  
In this carousel  

I run, my heart going back and forth  
It’s the first time  
I finally found what matters  
In this carousel  

You’re beautiful, rebellious, I’m immortal  
It’s you who unlocks everything my skin conceals  
I fear you like a sublime attraction  
A second before the action  

If you love me, if I open my heart to you  
It’s because you plant, a seed, a flower  
You’ll have to keep me, damaged or beautiful  
In this carousel  

And I run, my heart going back and forth  
It’s the first time  
I found a ticket for her  
In this carousel  

Yes, I run, my heart going back and forth  
It’s the first time  
I finally found what matters  
In this carousel  
In this carousel, in this, in this carousel  
In this carousel, in this, in this carousel  
In this carousel, in this, in this carousel  
In this carousel, in this, in this carousel
