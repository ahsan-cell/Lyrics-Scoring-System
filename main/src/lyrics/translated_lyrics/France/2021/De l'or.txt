**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Vitaa]  
Time might end up emptying us  
The whole world could try its best  
We have what they struggle to find  
It’s worth its weight in gold (it’s worth its weight in gold)  

[Verse 2: Slimane]  
When you speak, my head starts to shake  
And in your tears, I could drown  
What you do, even when it’s not enough  
It’s worth its weight in gold (it’s worth its weight in gold)  

[Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Destroy me, use me, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  
Take my heart, keep it, my heart, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  
If you fall, I fall, I can take it  
I can hold on still  
If you fall, I fall, nothing has changed  
I love you, so what?  
Destroy me, use me, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  

[Verse 3: Slimane]  
I want to start, restart, begin from scratch  
When I enjoy your flaws  
I’m touched by all the cliché words  
But it’s worth its weight in gold (but it’s worth its weight in gold)  

[Bridge 1: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Mmh, mmh  

[Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Destroy me, use me, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  
Take my heart, keep it, my heart, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  
If you fall, I fall, I can take it  
I can hold on still  
If you fall, I fall, nothing has changed  
I love you, so what?  
Destroy me, use me, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  

[Bridge 2: Vitaa & Slimane]  
No, no, here we are  
Do we know when it’s here?  
What’s beyond?  
No, no, here we are  
Do we know when it’s here?  
What’s beyond?  

[Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Destroy me, use me, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  
Take my heart, keep it, my heart, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  
If you fall, I fall, I can take it  
I can hold on still  
If you fall, I fall, nothing has changed  
I love you, so what?  
Destroy me, use me, I can hold on still  
And that, it’s worth its weight in gold  

[Outro: Vitaa & Slimane]  
No, no, here we are  
Do we know when it’s here?  
What’s beyond?  
No, no, here we are  
Do we know when it’s here?  
What’s beyond?
