**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kimberose]  
Even if it's tempting  
To flee the present  
Please, open your eyes  
Look ahead  
Go where the wind blows  
And then, do your best  

[Verse 1: Grand Corps Malade]  
Prisoner of doubt, not really of the past  
Too much shadow on the road, I can’t see the paths  
And I remember in madness my panel of workers  
I have the melancholy of chaos at camp  
Laughing at all our senses, and hours spent joking  
Insolent innocence of my most beautiful years  

[Chorus: Kimberose]  
Oh, where have our finest years gone?  
They’re slowly drifting away  
Where have our finest years gone?  
The future will bring them back  

[Verse 2: Grand Corps Malade]  
A past made up of imperfect events  
A past not so simple, smiles as trophies  
Then, I mix melancholy with the present  
It’s the beautiful brightening of soothing memories  
And the beautiful years, even stitched up  
I’ll take them to visit my future  

[Verse 3: Kimberose]  
Oh, oh, to laugh straight ahead  
To believe without pretending  
To draw differently  
I dream of our embraces  
Of the light on those extinguished smiles  
To find ourselves stronger, to become one  

[Chorus: Kimberose]  
Oh, where have our finest years gone?  
They’re slowly drifting away  
Where have our finest years gone?  
The future will bring them back  

[Verse 4: Grand Corps Malade]  
I’ve refined the story, unlocked hope  
To keep believing, I’m sending you an invitation  
The invitation to the marriage of nostalgia and destiny  
When one nourishes the other, turning the future into a feast  

[Bridge: Kimberose]  
I want to rediscover the charm of our life ahead  
It’s time to begin  

[Chorus: Kimberose]  
Oh, where have our finest years gone?  
They’re slowly drifting away  
Where have our finest years gone?  
The future...  
Oh, where have our finest years gone?  
They’re slowly drifting away  
Where have our finest years gone?  
The future will bring them back  
Where have they gone?  
Where have they gone?  
Where have they gone?  

[Outro: Grand Corps Malade]  
Then, I mix melancholy with the present  
It’s the beautiful brightening of soothing memories  
And the beautiful years, even stitched up  
I’ll take them to visit my future
