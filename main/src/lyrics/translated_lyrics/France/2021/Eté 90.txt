**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Raphaël]**  
We slid down the slope in no time,  
Pretended we didn’t know,  
Avoided those ambiguous glances,  
Acted like we couldn’t go.  
We drew the line, stayed clear of the roses,  
Pushed back the crowd, complicated the poses.  

**[Pre-Chorus 1: Raphaël]**  
But cursed friend, I want no more  
To dance this slow dance with you.  
Remember the nineties,  
When in the yard, every day, I was your king?  
You’ve grown so much and you catch me off guard,  
And sometimes even, you curl up in my arms.  

**[Break: Raphaël]**  
But never, never, never again,  
For I know, I’m the man unseen.  

**[Chorus: Adélaïde & Raphaël]**  
And if the sun rises on others,  
I know it’s me who chased away the roses.  
Love of love, you know it’s my fault,  
I’m far too scared to break the mold.  
We’ll just stick to our roles (Just stick to our roles, just stick to our roles),  
I know it’s sad but I’m under a spell (I’m under a spell, I’m under a spell).  

**[Verse 2: Adélaïde]**  
You set the rules at the end of the game,  
I was a teenager, in love,  
Then time slipped away in no time (In no time),  
Gone are the delightful years.  

**[Pre-Chorus: Adélaïde]**  
But cursed friend, I want no more  
To dance this slow dance with you.  
Remember the nineties,  
When in the yard, every day, you were my king.  

**[Chorus: Adélaïde & Raphaël]**  
And if the sun rises on others,  
I know it’s me who chased away the roses.  
Love of love, you know it’s my fault,  
I’m far too scared to break the mold.  
We’ll just stick to our roles (Just stick to our roles, just stick to our roles),  
I know it’s sad but I’m under a spell (The closer you get, the more I hit pause).  

**[Bridge: Adélaïde & Raphaël]**  
And alone every night (And alone every night),  
And alone every night (And alone every night),  
And alone every night, I stay in the dark,  
And alone every night, I stay in the dark,  
And alone every night, I stay in the dark,  
And alone every night, I stay in the dark.  
(If the sun rises on others)  
(I know it’s me who chased away the roses)  
(Love of love, you know it’s my fault)  
(I’m far too scared to break the mold)  

**[Chorus: Adélaïde & Raphaël]**  
And if the sun rises on others,  
I know it’s me who chased away the roses.  
Love of love, you know it’s my fault,  
I’m far too scared to break the mold.  
We’ll just stick to our roles (I’ll be there forever, your shoulder),  
I know it’s sad but I’m under a spell,  
The closer you get, the more I hit pause.
