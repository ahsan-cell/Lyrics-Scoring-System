**[Intro]**  
This sound is a dedication to Mrs. Pavoshko  
Do you remember? Mr. Diallo  

**[Chorus]**  
Hi, Mrs. Pavoshko, no  
I’m not in prison or the hospital, no  
I’m making hits, Mrs. Pavoshko  
And your kids love me, Mrs. Pavoshko  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Pavoshko  
I still have plenty of inspiration, Mrs. Pavoshko  
This is for my guys under weed, Mrs. Pavoshko  
If you want, we can tweet, Mrs. Pavoshko  

**[Bridge 1]**  
Solo, head underwater, I said to myself: "This is the moment  
Bring the fire!" Fire, Fire, fire  
Solo, head underwater, I said to myself: "This is the moment  
Bring the fire!" Fire, Fire, fire  

**[Verse 1]**  
Yo, do you remember me?  
The little black kid who wrote crazy verses  
Forget the delegate, tell me where the mic is  
Looks like someone snitched on me, where’s she getting this from?  
My life, the classes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
I don’t care about it  
Yes, I know, it’s a shame, so  
Your supervisors are against me, me, me  

**[Chorus]**  
Hi, Mrs. Pavoshko, no  
I’m not in prison or the hospital, no  
I’m making hits, Mrs. Pavoshko  
And your kids love me, Mrs. Pavoshko  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Pavoshko  
I still have plenty of inspiration, Mrs. Pavoshko  
This is for my guys under weed, Mrs. Pavoshko  
If you want, we can tweet, Mrs. Pavoshko  

**[Bridge 1]**  
Solo, head underwater, I said to myself: "This is the moment  
Bring the fire!" Fire, Fire, fire  
Solo, head underwater, I said to myself: "This is the moment  
Bring the fire!" Fire, Fire, fire  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’ve gone back and forth to the Rectorate too many times  
Your speeches, in my head, I turned them into a real choir  
You’re stuck in your office, telling me "Go tinker!"  
And instead of slapping you, I prefer to laugh about it  
As soon as our eyes meet, boom, adrenaline  
Yes, I know, I didn’t pay attention to the math teacher  
I was analyzing one of those famous verses where Nakk was kicking  
Yes, I know, ma’am, rap almost ruined my life  

**[Chorus]**  
Hi, Mrs. Pavoshko, no  
I’m not in prison or the hospital, no  
I’m making hits, Mrs. Pavoshko  
And your kids love me, Mrs. Pavoshko  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Pavoshko  
I still have plenty of inspiration, Mrs. Pavoshko  
This is for my guys under weed, Mrs. Pavoshko  
If you want, we can tweet, Mrs. Pavoshko  

**[Verse 3]**  
I swore that one day, you’d dance to my songs  
At one point, I wanted to get a Smith and Wesson  
A little voice whispered to me: "Go ahead, shoot up the school  
It’ll make a little anecdote, the principal is dumb"  
Why does that stupid supervisor ask me to empty my pockets?  
We’re not at the police station, and I’m loyal to my post  
Give me your detention hours, even go warn your colleagues  
You can be angry, we’re the cool kids of the school  

**[Bridge 2]**  
Yes, today they’ll say  
That I only rap for the little ones, just for the money  
What a funny guy, I’d even say "little fool"  
Who imagines having the strength of King Kong  
Yes, today they’ll say  
That I only rap for the little ones, just for the money  
What a funny guy, I’d even say "little fool"  
Who imagines having the strength of King Kong  
Anyway,  

**[Chorus]**  
Hi, Mrs. Pavoshko, no  
I’m not in prison or the hospital, no  
I’m making hits, Mrs. Pavoshko  
And your kids love me, Mrs. Pavoshko  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, Mrs. Pavoshko  
I still have plenty of inspiration, Mrs. Pavoshko  
This is for my guys under weed, Mrs.
