**[Intro]**  
My reason was dozing  
My conscience advised me  
My subconscious warned me  
But my spirit wants to soar  
My reason was dozing  
My conscience advised me  
My subconscious warned me  
But my spirit wants to soar  

**[Verse 1]**  
Stop, think about your kids  
What are you talking about?  
Chew on your words a bit  
You're paranoid  
Manipulated by another  
Who lets you believe the world is dark  
But too late  
Lost in a fog  
You're paranoid  
Manipulated by another  
You’re just a shadow of yourself  
Your reason is tearing apart  
You defy your desires  
Let yourself fall  
Remove those chains  
That hold you back, that hold you back  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop, I'm weaving connections, losing the thread  
Building my life, constructing in the void  
People tell me: "Hope keeps you alive"  
How can I live? I’m a zombie  
I’m a zombie  
I’m a zombie  

**[Verse 2]**  
Stop, calm things down a bit  
Now you realize  
That not everything is so rosy  
You're paranoid  
Manipulated by another  
You're not so different from others  
You've made mistakes  
Everyone has their flaws  
You're paranoid  
Manipulated by another  
You’re just a shadow of yourself  
Your reason is tearing apart  
You defy your desires  
Let yourself fall  
Remove those chains  
That hold you back, that hold you back  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop, I'm weaving connections, losing the thread  
Building my life, constructing in the void  
People tell me: "Hope keeps you alive"  
How can I live? I’m a zombie  
I’m a zombie  
I’m a zombie  

**[Bridge]**  
My reason was dozing  
My conscience advised me  
My subconscious warned me  
But my spirit wants to soar  
My reason was dozing  
My conscience advised me  
My subconscious warned me  
But my spirit wants to soar  
My spirit wants to soar  
My subconscious warned me  
But my spirit wants to soar  
My spirit wants to soar  
My subconscious warned me  
But my spirit wants to soar  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop, I'm weaving connections, losing the thread  
Building my life, constructing in the void  
People tell me: "Hope keeps you alive"  
How can I live? I’m a zombie  
I’m a zombie  
I’m a zombie
