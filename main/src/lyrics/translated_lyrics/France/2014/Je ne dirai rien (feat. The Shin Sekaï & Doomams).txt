**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain: Black M]  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...

[Verse 1: Abou Tall]  
You know very well that you're stunning  
In front of broke guys, you think you're the Everest  
Dude, she's not a girl for you: is that clear?  
You want to handle her without commitment? Good luck!  
Only 15,000 followers on Instagram  
Half-naked, you're ready to do anything to please  
You don't like my music, but you want your backstage pass  
You don't like ducks, but you keep making duck faces  
And you tell me: "Why can't I find a good guy?  
Why do guys all act like dogs?"  
Shut up! Because you're stupid, materialistic, greedy  
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid!  
And you think you're super smart and mature  
Sadly, the only reason we listen to you is your looks  
Otherwise, you don't have a number? I think I'm falling for you  
Uh, no? Alright then: go screw yourself.

[Refrain: Black M]  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...

[Verse 2: Dadju]  
You love to be told that your presence is essential  
But hanging out with a minimum wage worker is unthinkable  
Oversized ego, princess of a sandcastle  
And who cares if he has a good heart, what matters is that his account is spendable  
You live in your ideals, so you've neglected your studies  
You deserve only a Clio, but you want a Maybach  
You look down on people, your eyes bigger than a Black Card  
Carlton and the beautiful people, since you skip the steps  
Always a new desire every second  
Nothing is good enough for you  
You'd need the wonders of this world  
All nicely wrapped in a box  
Yet you're not that sexy, you only excite the guys at the end of their lives  
If I invite you to the VIP corner, it's because your friend begs me  
You need to stop gloating, stop questioning me  
Right now, I'm working for "Ind√©fini": CEO, fire them!

[Refrain: Black M]  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...

[Verse 3: Doomams]  
Will your heels support your big thighs?  
Your mini shorts are on the verge of breaking  
Fixated, I see myself sitting there with a big spliff  
Show me the goods, I'll show you luxury  
You blame me for chasing after the loot  
But you'd walk on blood to get Louboutins  
You love to look beautiful so you'll be noticed  
You love bad boys wanted by Interpol  
So spare me all your suffering  
Spare me all this excessive makeup  
Bitch! Your eyes are bigger than your stomach  
For a simple restaurant, should I empty my bank account?

[Refrain: Black M]  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...  
You love to look beautiful, yes, you love to shine at night  
You love the praises, you love when men notice you  
You love for everyone to think out loud that you're the best... Oh!  
I won't say a thing...

[Verse 4: Black M]  
Yes, your entrance brought a chill to the corner while I was chilling with all my guys
