**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain: La Fouine & Sindy]  
It's true I have too many foes, since I left the ground, solid ground  
They'd do anything to silence me, but behind me, I have true, true brothers  
Testing, what's the point? It's like making noise without a prayer  
Let them talk, I've made my dad proud, I'm not ready to do anything to please them, please, please  
It's true I have too many foes, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
They'd do anything to make us quiet, when things go wrong, we know who to count on  
It's true I have too many foes, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
Brother, they can't reach us, we're too far for that, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
We know who to count on, yeah, yeah  
We know who to count on, yeah, yeah  

[Verse 1: Sultan]  
I’ve bet everything on music, maybe I made a mistake  
As long as it’s not through chalk, it means I’m well surrounded  
All our belongings are sealed, our examples are from the cracked old ones  
I used to pass my notebook, today I’m on TV  
I rapped like a bell just to honor my brother  
Representing the Neuf-Deux: Bagneux, Nanterre  
I regret a bit the studies, I narrowly dodged the drugs  
What I had in 35 hours, today I have in 30 minutes  
So they envy us, yeah, I live off my passion  
You know I’m too hot, guaranteed is the fire  
I found my pleasure in putting my life into music  
My truth is raw because my words are too blunt  

[Refrain: La Fouine & Sindy]  
It's true I have too many foes, since I left the ground, solid ground  
They'd do anything to silence me, but behind me, I have true, true brothers  
Testing, what's the point? It's like making noise without a prayer  
Let them talk, I've made my dad proud, I'm not ready to do anything to please them, please, please  
It's true I have too many foes, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
They'd do anything to make us quiet, when things go wrong, we know who to count on  
It's true I have too many foes, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
Brother, they can't reach us, we're too far for that, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
We know who to count on, yeah, yeah  
We know who to count on, yeah, yeah  

[Verse 2: La Fouine]  
Yeah, Louboutin: if I play football, I’ll pop all the balls  
No wonder you don’t see me at the airport, I’m in the lounge  
I have no time to waste  
Going to work hard, fueling the flames of Hell  
Always next to my friends like a payphone and a halal butcher  
Dude, you’ve toured France on a bike without a saddle  
Go tell all those bitter haters who despise us  
That we’re way ahead, yeah Team BS  

[Verse 3: Fababy]  
The life of suburban folks is sad, so we sing  
I’m going in circles like a circuit or a sample  
Since "The Power of Numbers," I’ve always been official  
I have a sense of family, that’s my Italian side  
You need a defeat to savor a victory  
Between the lines of my wounds, I’ve stitched my story  
We celebrate, but it doesn’t hide our tears  
We burn buses and cars because our minds are on fire  

[Refrain: La Fouine & Sindy]  
It's true I have too many foes, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
They'd do anything to make us quiet, when things go wrong, we know who to count on  
It's true I have too many foes, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
Brother, they can't reach us, we're too far for that, on the side, a few repressed enemies  
We know who to count on, yeah, yeah  
We know who to count on, yeah, yeah  

[Outro: Sultan & La Fouine]  
Yeah, we know who to count on, yeah, yeah  
Brother, they can't reach us, we're too far for that, on the side, a few repressed enemies
