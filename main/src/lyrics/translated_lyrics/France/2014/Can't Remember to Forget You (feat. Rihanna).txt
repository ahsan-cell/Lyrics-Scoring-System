**Translated Lyrics:**

I left a note on the dresser  
"I won't repeat yesterday's mistakes again"  
When it comes to you, what I do  
Is selective perception, I only see your good sides  

[Shakira]  
The way you make me feel, yes, it has a strong effect on me  
I've never met someone like you, here we go  
You are now a part of me, a part of me  
So wherever you go, I will follow you  

[Shakira]  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
I keep forgetting that I should let you go  
But when you look into my eyes  
The only thing on my mind is that moment we kissed under the moonlight  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  

[Shakira]  
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  

[Rihanna]  
I've gone back to square one, I've lost control  
I'm in his bed, repeating yesterday's mistakes  
What I'm trying to tell you isn't about forgetting  
But you have selective perception, you only see the good sides  

[Rihanna, Shakira]  
The way they make me feel, the way they make me feel is something else  
I've never acted so foolishly, here we go  
He is now a part of me, a part of me  
So wherever he goes, I will follow him  

[Shakira & Rihanna]  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
I keep forgetting that I should let you go  
But when you look into my eyes  
The only thing on my mind is that moment we kissed under the moonlight  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  

[Shakira & Rihanna]  
I would steal to keep him by my side, I would even kill a man  
I would do anything for that man  
I would spend my last penny just to hold him tonight  
I would do anything for that man  
I would steal to keep him by my side, I would even kill a man  
I would do anything for that man  
I would spend my last penny just to hold him tonight  
I would do anything for that man  

[Shakira & Rihanna]  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh  
I keep forgetting that I should let you go  
But when you look into my eyes  
The only thing on my mind is that moment we kissed under the moonlight  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind  
But when you look into my eyes  
The only thing on my mind is that moment we kissed under the moonlight  
Oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-oh-oh (Oh-oh, oh-oh)  
Forgetting you doesn't even cross my mind
