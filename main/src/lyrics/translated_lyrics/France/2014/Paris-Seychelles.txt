**Translated Lyrics:**

Your smile outside in AngoulÃªme  
A mood-lifter, Melchior, Paris-Seychelles  
Discovering your body from the stage  
In the dark setting, Lucretia is queen  

**[Bridge 1]**  
We had said things  
That we won't hold on to  
While the water settles  
On our lilac thorns  

**[Verse 2]**  
The sun falls asleep over Seychelles  
The sand and dawn, a flower of salt  
Wait for me, I'm leaving from the Isle of Deer  
The storm is gold for getting lost  

**[Chorus]**  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  

**[Verse 3]**  
Suffering death to please you  
Defending our wrongs and then staying silent  
Desire still for the winter  
A chaos of efforts on Saint Hilaire  

**[Bridge 2]**  
We had said things  
That we won't hold on to  
While we settle down  
On our Mayan laurels  
We had said things...  

**[Chorus]**  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  
I need you so, oh oh  
I won't let you go, woh oh  

**[Bridge 3]**  
We had said things  
That we won't hold on to  
While the water settles  
On our lilac thorns
