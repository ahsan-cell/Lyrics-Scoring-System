**Translated Lyrics:**

It's time, the time for dancing is over  
Dance, don’t worry, you’re going to dance  
Swing yourself, but you’ll get swung around  
Get high, but you’ll get knocked down  

**[Chorus]**  
You’d like to have your party  
Your mother wants to throw you a party too  
The judge wants to throw you a party  
Everyone will throw you a party as well  

**[Verse 2]**  
You go out too much, at least that’s what they say  
They talk too much, that’s why your ears are ringing  
Whose fault is it? It’s someone else’s fault, right?  
It’s the others, you just want one thing  

**[Chorus]**  
You’d like to have your party  
Your mother wants to throw you a party too  
The judge wants to throw you a party  
Everyone will throw you a party as well  

**[Outro]**  
You’d like to have your party  
Your mother wants to throw you a party too  
The judge wants to throw you a party  
Everyone will throw you a party as well
