**Translated Lyrics:**

Where are the girls, the women with warrior spirits?  
Yes, those who know how to party, whether they're mothers or single  
Where are the men, the gangsters, the poor or the millionaires?  
The hipsters, the guys in tracksuits, the intellectuals, the stoners  
Where are the neighborhoods, the blocks, the social housing pushed aside?  
The residences, the upscale areas, the 205s, the Audi TTs  
Where are the blacks, the whites, the yellows, the greens, the reds, and the grays?  
Far from political amalgams, welcome to Cosmopolitania, yes  

[Chorus]  
Show me who you are  
Tonight is a day of peace (Ahahaha)  
Reveal yourself as you are  
Tonight, no dress code required (Ahahaha)  
Lalalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  

[Verse 2]  
Tonight it's rap, funk, R&B, or electro  
Variety, reggae, rock'n'roll, coupé-décalé, zouk, and dancehall  
Tonight it's boxing, it's soccer, it's Messi and Ronaldo  
LeBron James and Automoto, it's Goku and Naruto  
Tonight it's Call of Duty laid back, tonight it's a mixed wedding  
The bald, the mohawks, the curly hair, the blondes, the brunettes, the weaves  
Tonight it's love and peace, united through music  
Far from political amalgams, tonight no one divides us (yes)  

[Chorus]  
Show me who you are  
Tonight is a day of peace (Ahahaha)  
Reveal yourself as you are  
Tonight, no dress code required (Ahahaha)  
Lalalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  

[Bridge]  
Hey, hey, make me dream, hey, hey, arms raised  
Hey, hey, united we will rise high (very high)  
Hey, hey, make me dream, hey, hey, all mixed together  
Hey, hey, united we are so beautiful (so beautiful)!  
Hey, hey, make me dream, hey, hey, arms raised  
Hey, hey, united we will rise high (very high)  
Hey, hey, make me dream, hey, hey, all mixed together  
Hey, hey, united we are so beautiful (so beautiful)!  

[Outro]  
Lalalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala
