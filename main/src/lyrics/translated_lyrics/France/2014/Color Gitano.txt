**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's a way to see life  
A people greater than a country  
A destiny, a gaze  
It's music and cries  
One for all and all united  
A path, a story  

[Pre-Chorus]  
My life, my flavor  
My strength, my love  
Gypsy color  
My reason, my values  
My home, my color  
Gypsy color  
Gypsy  
The color of my sky  
Gypsy  
The heart that beats beneath my skin  

[Chorus]  
Gypsy  
The color of my sky  
Gypsy  
The heart that beats beneath my skin  
Gypsy  

[Verse 2]  
It's guitars, endless nights  
The warm words of the elders  
Respect and bonds  
It's your gaze meeting mine  
The two of us in the middle of the path  
And suddenly you become  

[Pre-Chorus]  
My life, my flavor  
My strength, my love  
Gypsy color  
My passion, my happiness  
My home, my color  
Gypsy color  
Gypsy  
The color of my sky  
Gypsy  
The heart that beats beneath my skin  

[Chorus]  
Gypsy  
The color of my sky  
Gypsy  
The heart that beats beneath my skin  
Gypsy  

[Verse 3]  
In our hearts, in our souls  
In our blood, in our flames  
Our gypsy colors  
In my heart, in my soul they ignite  
My gypsy colors  

[Chorus]  
Gypsy  
The color of my sky  
Gypsy  
The heart that beats beneath my skin  
Gypsy (Gypsy)  
The color of my sky (The color of my sky)  
Gypsy (Gypsy)  
The heart that beats beneath my skin (The heart that beats beneath my skin)  
Gypsy
