**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
We write on the walls the names of those we love  
Messages for the days to come  
We write on the walls with the ink of our veins  
We draw everything we wish to say  

[Verse 1]  
All around us  
There are signs of hope in the eyes  
Let’s give them words because in the night  
Everything fades, even their trace  

[Chorus]  
We write on the walls the names of those we love  
Messages for the days to come  
We write on the walls with the ink of our veins  
We draw everything we wish to say  
We write on the walls the strength of our dreams  
Our hopes in the form of graffiti  
We write on the walls so that love may rise  
One beautiful day over the sleeping world  

[Verse 2]  
Words only etched  
So we don’t forget, to change everything  
Let’s mix tomorrow in a refrain our faces, our blends  

[Chorus 1]  
We write on the walls the names of those we love  
Messages for the days to come  
We write on the walls with the ink of our veins  
We draw everything we wish to say  
We write on the walls the strength of our dreams  
Our hopes in the form of graffiti  
We write on the walls so that love may rise  
One beautiful day over the sleeping world  

[Chorus 2]  
We write on the walls the names of those we love  
Messages for the days to come  
We write on the walls with the ink of our veins  
We draw everything we wish to say  
We write on the walls the names of those we love  
Messages for the days to come  
We write on the walls with the ink of our veins  
We draw everything we wish to say  

[Outro]  
We write on the walls the strength of our dreams  
Our hopes in the form of graffiti  
We write on the walls so that love may rise  
One beautiful day over the sleeping world  
One beautiful day over the sleeping world
