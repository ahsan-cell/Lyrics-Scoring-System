**Translated Lyrics:**

Late at night in summer heat  
Expensive car, empty street  
There's a wire in my jacket, this is my trade  
It only takes a moment, don't be afraid  
I can hot-wire an ignition like some kind of star  
I'm just a poor boy in a rich man's car  

**Verse 2: Mylène Farmer**  
And the engine finally starts  
Our lives intertwine  
And we drive into the night  
Oh, the soft leather mixes in  
Stirring your imagination  
I can already see you  
In another situation  
You are a company director  
With a family life  
I have this feeling there’s so much more to say  

**Pre-Chorus: Mylène Farmer & Sting**  
(There's some kind of complication)  
He tells her  
(He's alone)  
(Spends the night with his lover)  
There are traces  
(Of her cologne)  
All the words from his mistress  
Whispered in his ear  
Like a love song  

**Chorus: Mylène Farmer & Sting**  
Please take me dancing tonight, I've been all on my own  
The promises of a day, of an evening  
I hear them like a psalm  
I'm just a prisoner of love  
Prisoner of my flaws  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight  

**Verse 3: Mylène Farmer**  
Imagine your wife  
Her life slipping through her fingers  
There’s a rule: be the hunter or the prey  
He’ll tell her he’s coming home late, business, off to Rome  

**Pre-Chorus: Sting & Mylène Farmer**  
But there's more than a suspicion  
In this lingering cologne  
(And the children will sulk)  
And she runs a red light  
And she drives into the night  

**Chorus: Mylène Farmer & Sting**  
Please take me dancing tonight, I've been all on my own  
The promises of a day, of an evening  
I still hear them  
I'm just a prisoner of love  
Prisoner of my flaws  
Take me dancing, please take me dancing tonight
