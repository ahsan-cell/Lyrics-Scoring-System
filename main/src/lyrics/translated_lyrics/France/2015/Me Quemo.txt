**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I burn, I burn you  
Your body is a fire  
With my sound, I heat you up  
And the heat rises, rises, rises  

[Verse 1]  
Come ignite me as the sun sets  
Heat my soul  
Never, never calm  
Come ignite me, since we’ve known each other  
Never out of gas  
With you, I’m flying  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And I always have my heart in summer  
Like a spark by my side  
Like a fire that clings to my skin  
And I always have my heart in summer  
As if winter were too much  
I always have warm blood  

[Chorus]  
I burn, I burn you  
Your body is a fire  
With my sound, I heat you up  
And the heat rises, rises, rises  

[Verse 2]  
Come ignite me, until night falls  
Enchant my soul  
Never, never calm  
Come ignite me, without ever stopping  
Never out of gas  
With you, I’m flying  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And I always have my heart in summer  
Like a spark by my side  
Like a fire that clings to my skin  
And I always have my heart in summer  
As if winter were too much  
I always have warm blood  

[Chorus]  
I burn, I burn you  
Your body is a fire  
With my sound, I heat you up  
And the heat rises, rises, rises  

[Bridge]  
If you want to forget everything, let the music play  
Come on, dance with me  
Oh, sing with me!  
If you want to forget everything, let the music play  
Come on, dance with me!  
Oh, sing with me!  

[Bridge]  
I burn, I burn, tonight I burn  
And the firefighters watch the fire  
It drives me crazy, with the sound  
And with my people, never defeated  
I burn, I burn, tonight I burn  
And the firefighters watch the fire  
It drives me crazy, with the sound  
And with my people, never defeated  

[Chorus]  
I burn, I burn you  
Your body is a fire  
With my sound, I heat you up  
And the heat rises, rises, rises  
I burn, I burn you  
Your body is a fire  
With my sound, I heat you up  
And the heat rises, rises, rises  

[Outro]  
Come ignite me  
With you, I’m flying  
And the heat rises, rises, rises  
Come ignite me  
Never out of gas  
With you, I’m flying  
And the heat rises, rises, rises
