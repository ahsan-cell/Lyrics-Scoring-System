**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m like a grain of sand  
Lost in the ocean  
I’ve lost my backpack  
I’ve lost my parents  
I’m like the water in the currents  
Tired of ignoring  
If I sink in the wind  
If I’m just passing through  

[Chorus x2]  
Take me to see the sea  
Let me drink the ocean  
Take me into the air  
Love me in the wind  

[Verse 2]  
I’m like a speck of dust  
If I fly away one morning  
I return to the earth  
I come and I go  
I’m like the water from the fountains  
Powerless and weary  
Pushed by this system  
That chases without ceasing  

[Chorus x2]  

[Verse 3]  
I’m actually like the others  
I’ll never know  
If I’m pursuing the quest  
If I’ve let it go  
I’m like filled with hope  
This morning I’m reborn  
Take me near the lighthouse  
Let’s go to the rocks  

[Chorus x2]
