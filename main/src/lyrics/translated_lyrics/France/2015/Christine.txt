**Translated Lyrics:**

I start the books from the end  
And I hold my chin high for no reason  
My eye that weeps is due to the wind  
My absences come from feeling  

**[Chorus]**  
I can't stand up  
The sky flows over my hands  
I can't stand up  
The sky flows over...  
It doesn't hold up  
The sky flows over my hands  
It doesn't hold up  
Under my feet, the sky returns  

**[Verse 2]**  
They smile red and speak to me in gray  
I pretend to understand everything  
And there's a guy crying outside  
On my face, there's a dust of gold  

**[Chorus]**  
I can't stand up  
The sky flows over my hands  
I can't stand up  
The sky flows over...  
It doesn't hold up  
The sky flows over my hands  
It doesn't hold up  
Under my feet, the sky returns  

**[Verse 3]**  
Us and the Man, we're out together  
Worse than just a simple half  
We count in halves  
Right on one of the shoulders  
Like origami  
An outstretched arm seems broken  
Everything's just ears and flashes  
These strange children  
Spat out outside by chance  
Hiding the effort in the scratch pad  
And a creepy song as a banner  
That goes:  
"I do all my makeup  
With Mercurochrome  
Against the pop-ups  
That assure me the throne  
I do all my makeup  
With Mercurochrome  
Against the pop-ups  
That assure me the throne"  

**[Chorus]**  
I can't stand up  
The sky flows over my hands  
I can't stand up  
The sky flows over...  
It doesn't hold up  
The sky flows over my hands  
It doesn't hold up  
Under my feet, the sky returns
