**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Jul]  
Beats  
We need to leave, yeah  
We need to leave  
We need to leave, yeah  
We need to leave  

[Verse 1: Oscar]  
I know, you call me but I want to drown my sorrows  
I’m here to get my pay, driving when I’m in the Benz  
I don’t care, I have all the time, my phone’s full of contacts  
You tackle me but I’ve jumped back, I’m making a comeback, I’ve got the J on the line  
And then I send it like it’s Las Vegas  
I’m at the casino, I can’t even see time passing  

[Verse 2: El Kid]  
Calibrated on the Cane', my Rolex is red and blue  
Eyes fixed on the skies, I make a wish  
Like the RS6, it consumes like the potato from Rif, the one that knocks you out  
Without Kamagra, cardio like Kamara  
You’re dead in the movie, turn off the camera  
At 2:20, I’m getting far away from here, my buddy  
The hmars, the radars, a smile, the photo  

[Chorus: Jul]  
And so many problems here, mamacita, we need to leave  
Too many jealous sons of ..., we need to leave  
And if we cross the civs, we need to leave  
We need to leave  

[Verse 3: 2Bang]  
The pressure, the dough, the brothers, the work  
Drinking from the bottle, detailing the rolls  
Savor, savor the dough, the balloons  
Refill the bales, the leaves, it’s [?]  
To get out of the struggle, cash comes out fast  
France is angry, the people are still here  
Health, family, everything’s good, thank God  
Born in pain to make a pile of dollars  
The sirens light up the city all night  
Racial profiling, us against them, that’s life  
There’s no choice anymore, it’s too hot  
There’s too much blood under my Nikes, at midnight, we need to leave  

[Verse 4: KLS]  
Yesterday, I don’t remember, I came home drunk  
A liter at first and later, I drank more  
The heart echoes, absences kill me  
I forget the girls, I carry scars of life  
She tells me: “KLS, why are your eyes so empty?”  
I say it’s the mirror of a heart that’s not very pretty  
Squinting, I take the fast lane  
Slaloming between them as if they were cones  
Here, it’s mined, we need to get out quickly  
My brother is stuck at Baumettes "Arrivals"  
We need to leave now, we’ll be dead in 10 years  
We need to leave now, we’ll be dead in 10 years  

[Verse 5: Zak]  
Life: a carnival, sooner or later, all masks fall  
I’m scared for my kids, every day, I tremble  
I cleared my life, too many people clutter me  
I do this, I did that, tell me, why are you copying?  
Yeah, why are you copying? Yeah, why are you copying?  
Yeah, why are you copying?  
We want the milli', million, we’re getting sick from it  
You know what I’m talking about, you know where our pain comes from  
I’m going in circles in this jar, pacing back and forth  
You act tough, but you’re actually nice  
Before everything goes live, we just need to leave, yeah  
I take everything and I’m off as usual  

[Chorus: Jul]  
And so many problems here, mamacita, we need to leave  
Too many jealous sons of ..., we need to leave  
And if we cross the civs, we need to leave  
We need to leave  

[Verse 6: Diego]  
They sell us dreams and it never ends  
They talk to us about factories with Richard Milles  
They tie our lives with needles in our arms  
But we leave our futures in the sheets  
We don’t touch the gat-nou, at home, it brings too much bad luck  
We live Marseille at night, we take the jet to Dubai  
We’re blue, in Q2, pinpon pinpon, there are the blues  
We’re blue, in Q2, pinpon pinpon, there are the blues  

[Verse 7: Ivory]  
I came to tell my story, I have Paris - Marseille in my head  
I live between the two, yeah, I’m a glitch in the game  
I’m the young one who worked alone, I don’t party  
I’m launched, it takes years
