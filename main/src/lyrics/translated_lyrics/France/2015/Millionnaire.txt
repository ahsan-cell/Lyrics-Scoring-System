**Translated Lyrics:**

I want to be rich from your smile  
From your will to rebuild  
From your adventures, from your cruises  
From your victory over cancer  
From your marriage, from your pregnancy  
From your forgiveness, from your wisdom  
From your freedom far from the cage  
From your difference, from your flag  

[Chorus]  
Yes, I need air, I'm overdrawn  
If you love me, make me a millionaire  
To buy what has no price  
In this fleeting world  
Make me a billionaire  
I need you  
Be my luxury, my diamond mine  

[Verse 2]  
I want to be poor from your tears  
From these fanatics and their weapons  
From these amalgams that divide us  
From the wars in Africa, from genocides  
From these diseases that condemn us  
From the day Mama takes her last breath  
From this youth that we abandon  
To the hands of these madmen with crazy ideas  

[Chorus]  

[Verse 3]  
Go, go, go, yeah  
Be my wealth, my glory, my intoxication  
Be my ladder to climb Everest  
Be my ring, my mark of nobility  
In the race for happiness, be my engine, my speed  
I want to be rich in humanity  
So I can leave tips behind  
Greed has put us in debt  
Fill my pockets with hope  
Fill my pockets with hope  
Fill my pockets with hope  
Fill my pockets with hope  

[Chorus]  

[Outro]  
Be my luxury, my diamond mine  
Be my luxury, my diamond mine
