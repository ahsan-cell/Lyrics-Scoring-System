**Translated Lyrics:**

It's entire days bent under a burden  
Never light, always bowing my back  
Before you  
Before you, let me tell you that it’s  
Dragging my feet, barely existing  
Despairing for something to happen  
Before you  
Before you, let me tell you  

[Chorus]  
Before you, what was it?  
If not a preamble?  
A long path of the cross  
Then everything shifts  
Before you, it was nothing  
Or so little that my body  
Before you remembers  
Feeling dead inside  

[Verse 2]  
It’s struggling, singing in the desert  
For whom were all these verses, all these tunes?  
Before you  
Before you, let me tell you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Before you, what was it?  
A rehearsal  
Of tired words and gestures  
Then the explosion  
Before you, it was nothing  
Or so little that my arms  
Had never embraced  
Anything but emptiness and cold  

[Chorus]  

[Outro]  
Before you, what was it?  
Just an immense stage  
Far too vast for me  
And then everything dances  
Before you, it was nothing  
Or so little that my life  
Began the morning  
Of the day I saw you.
