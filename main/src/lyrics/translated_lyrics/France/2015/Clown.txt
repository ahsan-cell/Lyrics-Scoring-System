**Translated Lyrics:**

Sorry, tonight I don't have a smile  
I pretend to be on the dance floor despite the routine  
My makeup is running, my tears are doing laundry  
On my clown face (my clown face)  
I know well that you don't care  
About my daily problems, my trash, my anger  
I'm here to help you forget, you want it to move  
Tonight I'm getting paid, I put on my red nose  

**[Chorus]**  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  

**[Verse 2]**  
Sorry kids if I'm not funny tonight  
But this colorful costume makes me ridiculous and sticks to me  
I've been hiding behind this angelic smile for a long time  
I no longer know how to shake it off, but who am I really?  
I've lost my way, have you seen my distress?  
I feel like a dog trying to gnaw at its leash  
But tonight the room is full, you want it to move  
So I clean my pain, and put on my red nose  

**[Chorus]**  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  

**[Bridge]**  
Am I the only one wearing this mask?  
Am I the only one pretending?  
This costume we put on every day  
Tell me, is it tailored for us?  
Or does it fit us too loosely?  

**[Chorus]**  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  
Lalalalala lalala lala  

**[Outro]**  
Sorry, tonight I don't have a smile  
My makeup is running, my tears are doing laundry  
On my clown face (my clown face)
