**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Niska]  
Dressed like never before, dressed like never before  
Dressed like never before, never  
Dressed like never before, dressed like never before  
Dressed like never before, never  

[Verse 1: Maître Gims]  
We break down your door, it’s the Gestapo  
I’m gonna find you, Meugui Columbo  
They want to sell tons like Gustavo  
A coffee without sugar, I’ve got plenty on my back  
Yeah, my dear, money makes you beautiful  
It’s been six years we’ve been throwing combos  
I handle the melodies, Waraoui, Warano  
You wonder if it’s not a conspiracy  

[Bridge: Maître Gims]  
Hands up, hands up  
Except for the guys dressed in Balmain  
Balmain, Balmain  
Baggy pants like Aladdin  
Hands up, hands up  
Except for the guys dressed in Balmain  
Balmain, Balmain  
Baggy pants like Aladdin  

[Pre-Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Come before midnight (Come before midnight)  
I’m going to make you live a dream (I’m going to make you live a dream)  
Step onto the dance floor, all eyes are on you  
The clothes shine like One Thousand and One Nights  
Paris is truly my-my-my-magical  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before  
Loulou and 'Boutin (bando)  
Loulou and 'Boutin ('Boutin na 'Boutin)  
Coco from Chanel (Coco)  
Coco from Chanel (Coco Chanel)  

[Verse 2: Niska]  
Niama na ngwaku des ngwaku  
I control the scene, appreciate my journey  
Handek to your girl, naughty little rascal, you’re cheated  
When she saw me, she dumped you  
Ferregamo, crocodile skin on the shoe  
I’m Congolese, you see what I mean?  
Hein hein, Norbatisé  
Maître Gims has summoned me  
Charlie Delta localized  
The mbilas are focused  
Dressed like jaja, never  
From now on, I make them jealous  
I admit, I live only for victory, fool  
The competition is on my bladder  
Loubou, Zano, and Hermès  
Louis, empty your bag, I want the recipe  
(Bando na bando)  

[Pre-Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Come before midnight (Come before midnight)  
I’m going to make you live a dream (I’m going to make you live a dream)  
Step onto the dance floor, all eyes are on you  
The clothes shine like One Thousand and One Nights  
Paris is truly my-my-my-magical  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before  
Loulou and 'Boutin (bando)  
Loulou and 'Boutin ('Boutin na 'Boutin)  
Coco from Chanel (Coco)  
Coco from Chanel (Coco Chanel)  

[Outro: Maître Gims]  
Kinshasa and Brazza (God bless)  
Libreville, Abidjan (God bless)  
Yaoundé and Douala (God bless)  
Bamako and Dakar (God bless)  
Dany Synthé oh (God bless)  
Bedjik and Darcy hey (God bless)  
Bilou and Dem-dem (God bless)  
Djuna Djanana hey (God bless)  

[Chorus: Maître Gims]  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before (never)  
Dressed like never before  
Loulou and 'Boutin (bando)  
Loulou and 'Boutin ('Boutin na 'Boutin)  
Coco from Chanel (Coco)  
Coco from Chanel (Coco Chanel)
