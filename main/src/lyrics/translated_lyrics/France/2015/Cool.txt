**[Verse 1]**  
I spent hours singing late into the night  
Just to have some fun or to kill the time  
For the thrill, to flirt with the girls  
Not to end up in the magazines  
I never thought I could touch people's hearts  
But fate had other plans from the start  
Here I am before you on stage  
Giving you my love and my pain  
There were the stages, there were the photos  
There were the TVs, and the chained cities  
When it will stop, I do not know  
I even serenaded Eva Longoria  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Everything has changed, I've moved  
From the shadows to the light  

**[Chorus]**  
But I play it cool, cool, cool  
It's true that I've dreamed so much  
And I roll, roll, roll  
Even without knowing where I'm going  
I play it cool, cool, cool  
I have no intention of changing  
And I roll, roll, roll  
With those who love me, who love me  

**[Verse 2]**  
I spent nights playing on my guitar  
Dreaming of concerts, never of fame  
To enjoy, to have wild nights  
Not to become a star or an idol  
Luck decided to smile on my life  
Since then, I spend my time using my voice  
I never thought I'd be on the front page  
I feel ready to reach for the Moon  
There were the tours, thousands of people  
Millions of views, through television  
If by fate, it all ends tomorrow  
I don’t know where I’ll go  
But I know where I come from  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Everything has changed, I've moved  
From the shadows to the light  

**[Chorus]**  
But I play it cool, cool, cool  
It's true that I've dreamed so much  
And I roll, roll, roll  
Even without knowing where I'm going  
I play it cool, cool, cool  
I have no intention of changing  
And I roll, roll, roll  
With those who love me, who love me  

**[Chorus Repeat]**  
But I play it cool, cool, cool  
It's true that I've dreamed so much  
And I roll, roll, roll  
Even without knowing where I'm going  
I play it cool, cool, cool  
I have no intention of changing  
And I roll, roll, roll  
With those who love me, who love me  
But I play it cool, cool, cool  
It's true that I've dreamed so much  
And I roll, roll, roll  
Even without knowing where I'm going  
I play it cool, cool, cool  
I have no intention of changing  
And I roll, roll, roll  
With those who love me, who love me
