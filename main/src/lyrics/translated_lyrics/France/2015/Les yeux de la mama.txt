**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When I'm cold, she becomes my light  
Like a sun in this existence  
When I'm in pain, she turns to prayer  
She tells me everything in silence  
When I suffer, she suffers with me  
When I laugh, she bursts out in joy  
My songs are often for her  
She will always be my wonder  
When I’m not up to par  
She lifts me higher than the sky  
She is the splendor of splendors  
She is the sap, she is the honey  
It’s her blood that flows in my veins  
And memories by the hundreds  
Cradle my heart with a thousand stars  
She is my quest, she is my Grail  

[Chorus]  
Oh my God, let me keep them  
The beautiful eyes of Mama  
Take away everything else from me  
But not the softness of her gestures  
She carried me before the world  
She still carries me every second  
She will take me with her  
I will always be faithful to her  

[Verse 2]  
When I hurt, she is sweetness  
Like a caress in this existence  
When I give up, she becomes a lioness  
And lifts me up with patience  
When I have grand ambitions  
She brings me back without hurting me  
She is in this hellish world  
My star among the stars  

[Chorus]  
Oh my God, let me keep them  
The beautiful eyes of Mama  
Take away everything else from me  
But not the softness of her gestures  
She carried me before the world  
She still carries me every second  
She will take me with her  
I will always be faithful to her  
Oh my God, let me keep them  
The beautiful eyes of Mama  
Take away everything else from me  
But not the softness of her gestures  
She carried me before the world  
She still carries me every second  
She will take me with her  
I will always be faithful to her  
Oh my God, let me keep them  
The beautiful eyes of Mama  
Take away everything else from me  
But not the softness of her gestures  
She carried me before the world  
She still carries me every second  
She will take me with her  
I will always be faithful to her
