**Translated Lyrics:**

When in the city, the grain rises  
A wind of restless nerves  
As dreams fade away  
In my reality  
I want ballads on the shore  
Oh, a bit of humanity  
Less concrete, more truce  
A life of quality  
Less concrete, more dreams  
In my reality  

[Chorus] x2  
What do I lack? A lifeline  
Far from the subway, from its noise  
Eyes fixed on the coastline  
Forgetting your distant face  

[Verse 2]  
I want tears that don’t cut deep  
And less pain in 4 by 3  
A simple happiness, but to my taste  
It’s somewhat true, but it means everything  
I want more swell in my foam  
And less crowd on my asphalt  
Those little things that only make sense  
Once we’ve lost them  
Those little things that only make sense  
Once we’ve lost them  

[Chorus] x2  
What do I lack? A lifeline  
Far from the subway, from its noise  
Eyes fixed on the coastline  
Forgetting your distant face  

[Verse 3]  
What do I lack then? A lifeline  
To ride my vague melancholy  
Beautiful ocean, gentle breeze  
To dry the salt of my tears  

[Chorus] x3  
What do I lack? A lifeline  
Far from the subway, from its noise  
Eyes fixed on the coastline  
Forgetting your distant face
