**Translated Lyrics:**

Yet they are truly here  
Remnants of glory  
Painful joy  
Empty of history  
Once upon a time  
There was a He, a She  
And She took flight  

I walk the tightrope  
On a thread of glass  
All my clocks  
Are spinning backwards  
I gather hours  
Between you and me  
Rubble of resentments and fears  

We should laugh about it  
It’s so ordinary  
A melodrama  
Of little worth  
I know there’s much worse  
I know the hospital  
But can I at least say  
That it hurts  

And what do I do now  
After you?  
My dreams are empty  
I only make missteps  
What do I do  
Down here?  
The beautiful memories burn me with cold  
Without you, what am I good for?  

Streets without color  
The world is in mourning  
So empty and so alone  
Yet so filled with you  
Declared guilty  
You go to hell  
While I bear the cross  

Why not smile?  
Nothing more normal  
A melodrama  
Of little worth  
I know there’s much worse  
The death penalty  
But I can tell you  
That it hurts  

And what do I do now  
After you?  
My dreams are empty  
I only make missteps  
What do I do  
Down here?  
The beautiful memories burn me with cold  
Without you, what am I good for?  

And what do I do now  
With my steps?  
All the streets lead to dead ends  
And what do I listen to, without your voice?  
Without your words, your laughter, your songs, your spark  
What’s the point of all this  
Without you?
