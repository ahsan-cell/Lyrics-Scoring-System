**Translated Lyrics:**

My dear parents, I’m leaving  
I love you, but I’m leaving  
You will no longer have a child  
Tonight  
I’m not running away, I’m flying  
Understand well, I’m flying  
Without smoke, without alcohol  
I’m flying, I’m flying  

[Verse 1]  
She was watching me yesterday  
Worried, troubled, my mother  
As if she could sense it  
In fact, she suspected, she heard  
I said I was fine  
Completely calm on the outside  
She acted as if nothing was wrong  
And my father, helpless, smiled  
Not looking back  
Moving a little further away  
There’s no station, another station  
And finally the Atlantic  

[Chorus]  
My dear parents, I’m leaving  
I love you, but I’m leaving  
You will no longer have a child  
Tonight  
I’m not running away, I’m flying  
Understand well, I’m flying  
Without smoke, without alcohol  
I’m flying, I’m flying  

[Verse 2]  
I wonder on my way  
If my parents suspect  
That my tears have flowed  
My promises and the desire to move forward  
Only believing in my life  
Everything that is promised to me  
Why, where, and how  
On this train that’s pulling away  
Every moment  

[Bridge]  
It’s strange, this cage  
That blocks my chest  
I can’t breathe anymore  
It prevents me from singing  

[Chorus]  
My dear parents, I’m leaving  
I love you, but I’m leaving  
You will no longer have a child  
Tonight  
I’m not running away, I’m flying  
Understand well, I’m flying  
Without smoke, without alcohol  
I’m flying, I’m flying
