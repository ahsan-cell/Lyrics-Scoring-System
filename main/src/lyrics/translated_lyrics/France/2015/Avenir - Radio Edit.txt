**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it  

[Verse 1]  
You left far behind without much reason  
You left me yesterday, the end of the season  
I don’t want to know, we’ve drifted apart  
You won’t have me anymore, and it’s all over  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it  

[Chorus]  
I hope you’re going to suffer  
And that you’ll sleep poorly  
In the meantime, I’ll write  
For tomorrow, the future (For tomorrow, the future)  
For tomorrow, the future (For tomorrow, the future)  

[Verse 2]  
Gone for a night, just to talk to him  
At the end of a hallway, that’s where you wanted to go  
The hypocrisy of one night, the glasses are shattered  
Hopes have flown away and our hearts are broken  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it  

[Chorus]  
I hope you’re going to suffer  
And that you’ll sleep poorly  
In the meantime, I’ll write  
For tomorrow, the future (For tomorrow, the future)  
For tomorrow, the future (For tomorrow, the future)  

[Verse 3]  
Left alone in the street, I’m searching for my way  
I can’t find it anymore, it seems so far away  
I’ve forgotten you, you don’t affect me anymore  
And I’m off to travel, thinking about tomorrow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it  

[Chorus]  
I hope you’re going to suffer  
And that you’ll sleep poorly  
In the meantime, I’ll write  
For tomorrow, the future (For tomorrow, the future)  
For tomorrow, the future (For tomorrow, the future)  

[Outro]  
Left far behind without much reason  
You left me yesterday, the end of the season
