**Translated Lyrics:**

Love is like a Twitter bird  
We’re blue for it, just for 48 hours  
First, we affiliate, then we follow  
We become cracked, and end up solo  
Watch out for yourself  
And for all those who like you  
Plastic smiles are often just hashtag hits  
Watch out for yourself  
Ah friends, buddies, or followers  
You’re mistaken, you’re just in vogue  

**[Chorus]**  
Watch out for yourself  
If you love yourself  
Watch out for me  
If I love myself  
Watch out for us, watch out for them, watch out for you  
And then each for their own  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  

**[Verse 2]**  
Love is a child of consumption  
It will always want, want, want more choices  
Do you want feelings that fell off a truck?  
Supply and demand is the only law  
Watch out for yourself  
"But I already know the dangers,  
I’ve kept my ticket and, if needed, I’ll exchange it,  
Watch out for yourself  
And, if necessary, I’ll take my revenge  
That cursed bird, I’ll put it in a cage  
I’ll make it sing."  

**[Chorus]**  
Watch out for yourself  
If you love yourself  
Watch out for me  
If I love myself  
Watch out for us, watch out for them, watch out for you  
And then each for their own  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  
And that’s how we love, love, love, love  
Like this, consume, sum, sum, sum, sum  

**[Outro]**  
One day you buy, one day you love  
One day you throw away, but one day you pay  
One day you’ll see, we’ll love each other  
But first, we’ll all die, like rats.
