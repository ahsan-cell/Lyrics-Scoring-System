**Translated Lyrics:**

In my pink silk jacket  
I wander feeling morose  
The twilight is grandiose  

**[Chorus]**  
Heartless  
How could you be so heartless?  
How could you be so heartless?  
How could you be so heartless?  

**[Verse 2]**  
A bit of a cursed dandy, a bit aged  
In this luxury that crumbles  
Do you remember when I sang  
In the cellars of London?  
A little drowned in the smoke  
This sophisticated rock  
Every night you stayed there  

**[Chorus]**  
Heartless  
How could you be so heartless?  
How could you be so heartless?  
How could you be so heartless?  

**[Verse 3]**  
A bit of a cursed bandit, a bit aged  
The musicians are wrinkled  
And that keyboard, how lovely it is  
I try to remember  
Once again  
The chords of this rock  
That solidified like the English  

**[Chorus]**  
Heartless  
How could you be so heartless?  
How could you be so heartless?  
How could you be so heartless?  

**[Verse 4]**  
In the night I hear them talk  
The coldest story ever told  
Somewhere far along this road  
He lost his soul  
To a woman so heartless  
How could you be so heartless?
