**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We used to have it all planned  
We thought we knew how it would be  
We were gazing at the greatest view  
We didn’t see the limits  
We didn’t see we were going too fast  
Here we are, facing the unknown  
And we’re light-years away  
From everything that held us back yesterday  
Alone in the night  
We’re alone in the night  
We never wanted to change our path  
All the roads led only to doubts  
Not to Rome  
Look where we are now  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We need another season  
To truly start anew  
To begin again, my love  
With a lighter heart  
Just another season  
Just one more good reason  
To change our minds and our skin  
To let love take us at our word  

[Chorus]  
So I'll be needing you  
And I know you'll be needing me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  
And I believe in you  
And I know you believe in me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  

[Verse 2]  
I see us in the rearview mirror  
I hear the voice of better days  
No matter how hard we try to act dead  
Rushing straight into the scenery  
We get lost, there’s nothing we can do  
We take it as it comes  
Did we really need to love each other again?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Because we need another season  
To truly start anew  
To begin again, my love  
With a lighter heart  
Just another season  
Just one more good reason  
To change our minds and our skin  
To let love take us at our word  

[Chorus]  
So I'll be needing you  
And I know you'll be needing me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  
And I believe in you  
And I know you believe in me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  
So I'll be needing you  

[Bridge]  
We're only at the start  

[Chorus]  
So I'll be needing you  
And I know you'll be needing me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  
And I believe in you  
And I know you believe in me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  
So I'll be needing you  
And I know you'll be needing me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  
And I believe in you  
And I know you believe in me too  
We're in this game together  
We're in this game together  

[Outro]  
So I'll be needing you
