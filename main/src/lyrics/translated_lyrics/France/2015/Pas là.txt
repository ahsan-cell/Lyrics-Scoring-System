**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I’m a jug  
Cracked even more  
My skin is weathered  
Since you, dried out  
When the moon rises  
And the cool wind blows  
Out of habit  
I look for you on the couch  

[Verse 2]  
God, how far away  
The night of joy  
When I found your hand  
Long before the sadness  
You were chasing me  
You had seen me  
You took me by the collar  
And twisted my neck  

[Chorus]  
Not here  
But you’re not here, where are you? Not here  
But you’re not here, where are you? Not here  
But you’re not here, where are you?  
But where are you? (Not here, not here, not here…)  

[Verse 3]  
Ivory nights  
Sure, I owe you that  
If yours are dark  
No, I don’t hold it against you  
If life goes on  
Well, especially yours  
I numb myself  
Playing the fountains  

[Chorus]  
Not here  
But you’re not here, where are you? Not here  
But you’re not here, where are you? Not here  
But you’re not here, where are you?  
But where are you? (Not here, not here, not here…)  

[Verse 4]  
I replace you  
As best as I can  
Let everything fade  
I make it my wish  
It will be without you then  
So I just have to agree  
To you, the jugs  
Hearts in pieces  
Let’s be the hive  
Of a future in celebration
