**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Day one, love number one  
It's the supreme love  
Tell me that you love me  
I want a day number two  
A suite at the hotel  
A deadly addition  
I watched you all night  
Dancing on my soul is no longer allowed  
Nine days, life is like velvet  
And eternity, a necessity  
Day ten, a variation of delight  
What would you like to do?  
A stroll at sea  
Every day, a dependence on love  
No dancing around  

[Chorus]  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns  

[Verse 2]  
A hundred days, if it were a day without  
Without seeming like a storm in the air  
Day thousand, you hit the mark  
Terebinth essence hidden in the chest  
Every day, a dependence on love  
No dancing around  

[Chorus]  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns  

[Bridge]  
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns  

[Chorus]  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns  
It's day one, the one we remember  
The one that fades when you replace me  
When you hold me back, it's the one that returns
