**Translated Lyrics:**

Children of the parks, kids from the beaches  
The wind threatens the sandcastles shaped by my hands  
Time spares no one, alas  
The years go by, the echo drifts away on the Dune of Pilat  

[Pre-Chorus]  
With the changing seasons, in photo booths  
I surrender to those glimmers of the past  
With the changing seasons, decisions made, I let go  

[Chorus]  
When memories intertwine, tears come to me  
And the song of sirens pulls me back into winter  
Oh cruel melancholy, delicate harmony, solitary euphoria  
Tadalalala, tadalalala  
Tadalalala, tadalala  

[Verse 2]  
How many pranks, how many escapades  
How many traces, how many masks  
Have we left behind?  
Laying down arms, setting sail  
Finding calm in this chaos before I drown in it  

[Pre-Chorus]  
With the changing seasons, in photo booths  
I surrender to those glimmers of the past  
With the changing seasons, decisions made, I let go  

[Chorus]  
When memories intertwine, tears come to me  
And the song of sirens pulls me back into winter  
Oh cruel melancholy, delicate harmony, solitary euphoria  
Ooooh, oooooh  

[Chorus]  
When memories intertwine, tears come to me  
And the song of sirens pulls me back into winter  
Oh cruel melancholy, delicate harmony, solitary euphoria  
When memories intertwine, tears come to me  
And the song of sirens pulls me back into winter  
Oh cruel melancholy, delicate harmony, solitary euphoria  

[Outro]  
Tadalalala, tadalalala  
Tadalalala, tadalala  
Tadalalala, tadalalala  
Tadalalala, tadalala
