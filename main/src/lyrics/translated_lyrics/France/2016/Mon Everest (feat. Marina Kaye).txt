**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Soprano]  
I climbed, I climbed, I climbed without letting go of my principles and my values  
I will never forget where I come from, I know what it’s like to be a man of color  
I know what it’s like to work twice as hard to measure up  
If I sing about cosmopolitanism, it’s because I’ve seen it all  
They told me, they told me: "Kid, wake up, you’re a bit too much of a dreamer  
Kid, you have too big an appetite, reality is bland and flavorless  
Forget your teenage dreams, like everyone else, follow the herd" (Follow the herd)  
But the stubborn one I was had determination packed in my backpack  
None of their discouragements brought me to my knees (No-no)  
No doctor in the world could cure my fever (No-no)  
Everything is possible when you know who you are  
Everything is possible when you embrace who you are  
Today, look at me contemplating my sacrifices at the summit of my Everest  

[Chorus: Marina Kaye, Soprano]  
I spent my life climbing, hiding, and fighting for what I want (What I want)  
I had no one by my side, just my pain, my hunger, and my cries  
I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I gotta fight, fight (Fight)  
Fight, fight for who I am  
And I will (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Verse 2: Soprano]  
I sang, I sang, I sang love and peace for years  
I’m that melancholic who heals when his M-A-U-X starts to rhyme  
A positive rapper to give hope to this disillusioned youth  
At a time when we’re held up with an AK 49.3 to make us bend  
My family, my family, my family, everything’s rolling for me because they’re my engines  
My VIP circle is my family, for them I shone before the spotlight  
I love you Comoria, I love you Massilia (Hallelujah)  
My image, my speech, my journey, my fight, all of this is to honor them  
Cancer stole a brother from me, only my kids can soak up my tears  
Still standing, singing that love is the best weapon against terror  
I unload it when I sing, in a community center or at the Restos du Cœur*  
I’m back more human than ever, send me smiles more than flowers  

[Chorus: Marina Kaye, Soprano]  
I spent my life climbing, hiding, and fighting for what I want (What I want)  
I had no one by my side, just my pain, my hunger, and my cries  
I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I gotta fight, fight (Fight)  
Fight, fight for who I am (I know, I know, I know, I know)  
And I will (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Bridge: Marina Kaye, Soprano]  
This time I know I fight for who I am  
I know, I know (I know), I know, I know (I know)  
This time I know I fight for who I am  
I know, I know (I know), I know, I know  
(Everything is possible when you know who you are)  
(Everything is possible when you embrace who you are)  
This time I know I fight for who I am  
(Everything is possible when you know who you are)  
(Everything is possible when you embrace who you are)  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
(Everything is possible when you know who you are)  
(Everything is possible when you embrace who you are)  
For who I am  
(Everything is possible when you know who you are)  
I know, I know, I know, I know  

[Chorus: Marina Kaye, Soprano]  
I spent my life climbing, hiding, and fighting for what I want (What I want)  
I had no one by my side, just my pain, my hunger, and my cries  
I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I gotta fight, fight (Fight)  
Fight, fight for who I am  
And I will  

[Outro: Soprano]  
Everything is possible when you know who you are  
Everything is possible when you embrace who you are  
Everything is possible when you know who you are  
Everything is possible when you embrace who you are
