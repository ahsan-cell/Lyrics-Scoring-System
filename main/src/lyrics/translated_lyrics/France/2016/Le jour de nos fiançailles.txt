**Translated Lyrics:**

I take things as they come  
Without ever questioning too much  
I’m too strong to be held back  
I’m a warrior, a centurion  
I love to swim behind the coral reef  
To better see the horizon  
I’m not afraid to dive into battle  
Tomorrow I’ll dance to the sound of the cannon  
To the sound of the cannon  

**[Chorus]**  
Give me a kiss, jump into my arms  
Kiss me before I leave  
You know we won’t see each other much  
I’m leaving on the day of our engagement  
I want to remember, I want to make it count  
Let’s not get caught up in the details  
I want us to make love like crazy  
I’m leaving on the day of our engagement  
The day of our engagement  

**[Verse 2]**  
I thought I was on the right side  
That the others across were wrong  
At least that’s what public opinion said  
When it opened its big mouth  
One day alive but tomorrow I’ll be dead  
My pretty fiancée will be left alone  
Left alone  

**[Chorus]**  
Give me a kiss, jump into my arms  
Kiss me before I leave  
You know we won’t see each other much  
I’m leaving on the day of our engagement  
I want to remember, I want to make it count  
Let’s not get caught up in the details  
I want us to make love like crazy  
I’m leaving on the day of our engagement  

**[Bridge]**  
My parents cry, they’re filled with rage  
They never understood this war  
Let them talk, they have so much pain  
It’s with honors that I’ll be buried  

**[Chorus]** (x2)  
Give me a kiss, jump into my arms  
Kiss me before I leave  
You know we won’t see each other much  
I’m leaving on the day of our engagement  
I want to remember, I want to make it count  
Let’s not get caught up in the details  
I want us to make love like crazy  
I’m leaving on the day of our engagement  
The day of our engagement
