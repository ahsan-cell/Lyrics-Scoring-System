**Translated Lyrics:**

Days go by, but it doesn't matter, I'm struggling to live  
Drunk on this scent so different from yours  
Worse, I've counted every minute that keeps me tied to her  
As if I were my own prisoner  
It's been almost a year since she saved me, from you  
Often I wonder where I would be, for you  
Often I wonder what you're doing, where you are, who you love  
Get out of my thoughts!  
I've changed my address, my number, thank you  
I've thrown away your letters and your flaws, even though  
I pretended to find the strength  
I keep deep inside me  
All the ways you loved me  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm trying to forget you with another  
Who vainly tries to redeem your faults  
I'm trying, but nothing works  
I can't, I don't want to, I just can't  
I don't love her like I loved you  

**[Verse 2]**  
She, she tried to console me  
Even if she doesn't have your words or your past, it's true  
But she doesn't have your taste for parties, for the night, for others  
For everything I hate  
She dried all my tears, you know  
She picked up your broken pieces  
And she settled all your unpaid debts, your impostures, your scribbles  
Everything you left me  
She loves me like crazy, she knows me by heart  
She tells me she loves me sometimes for hours  
But she doesn't feel your scent  
Why do I breathe you in her arms?  
Get out of my thoughts!
