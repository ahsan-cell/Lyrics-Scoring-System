**Translated Lyrics:**

A photo, a date, it’s hard to believe  
Yet it was just yesterday, my memory would deceive  
And those faces of children, and mine in this mirror  

**[Verse 2]**  
Oh, it’s not to complain, you have nothing to fear  
Life has spoiled me so much, I struggle to keep it near  
Oh my God, I’ve had my share, and so much more in many ways  

**[Pre-Chorus 1]**  
But when we live too beautifully, too intensely, we forget the time that flies  
Like losing our way amidst such vast skies  
Barely enough time to adjust, barely must we give up our place  
If I could  

**[Chorus]**  
One more evening, one more hour, one more tear of happiness  
A favor, like a flower  
A breath, a mistake  
A bit of us, a little of everything  
To say it all again or remain silent in glances  
Just a delay, barely still, even if it’s late  

**[Verse 3]**  
I’ve never asked for anything, it’s not a big deal  
Come on, facing eternity, it won’t even be revealed  
It will stay between us, oh just a slight delay  

**[Pre-Chorus 2]**  
So many kill time, so many lose it or let it pass  
So many lie to themselves, dreaming of moments of grace  
Oh, I’d give my place in paradise, if I’m forgotten on Earth  
Just yesterday  

**[Chorus]**  
One more evening, one more hour, one more tear of happiness  
A favor, like a flower  
A breath, a mistake  
A bit of us, a little of everything  
To say it all again or remain silent in glances  
Just a delay, barely still, I know, it’s late  

**[Bridge]**  
It’s not much, just a pause  
For time, for the clocks to rest  
And to caress, just a kiss  
A kiss  

**[Outro]**  
One more evening, one more hour, a bit of us, a little of everything, one more hour  
An evening
