**Translated Lyrics:**

When the dance comes to an end, too late  
Everything will taste like ashes  
If only along the way  
Love could rise from the void  
To have no other wishes but for each other  
Even for a moment  

[Chorus]  
Words on the tip of my tongue  
A path towards life  
If I let go, I will build the city of love  
If I know that I have it, the world and desire  
If there, I wait for you, I will build the city of love  
The city of love  

[Verse 2]  
Who does not know fear  
Does not know courage  
If I'm in a good mood, there's no rage  
When, moving forward in the dark  
When I study the infinite  
I see snowflakes, poetry  

[Chorus]  
Words on the tip of my tongue  
A path towards life  
If I let go, I will build the city of love  
If I know that I have it, the world and desire  
If there, I wait for you, I will build the city of love  
The city of love  

[Chorus]  
Words on the tip of my tongue  
A path towards life  
If I let go, I will build the city of love  
If I know that I have it, the world and desire  
If there, I wait for you, I will build the city of love  
The city of love  

Words on the tip of my tongue  
A path towards life  
If I let go, I will build the city of love  
If I know that I have it, the world and desire  
If there, I wait for you, I will build the city of love  
The city of love, the city of love
