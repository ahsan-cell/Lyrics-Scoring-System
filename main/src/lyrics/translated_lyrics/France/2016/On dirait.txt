**Translated Lyrics:**

When it’s dark all around me  
I’ve carried quite a bit of pain on my back  
You, you held me up with your strength  

No, no, no, I haven’t always been sure of myself  
I’ve doubted so many times  
No, no, no, I don’t know what I would do without you  
Oh yeah  

It seems like we all have an angel  
It seems, it really seems to be you  
It seems that in this strange world  
It seems you’ve always been there  

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  

You tell me my dream is just within reach  
That I just need to stretch out my hand  
I could spend my whole life listening to you  
Gentleness is your only refrain  

No, no, no, it’s not always easy for me  
I’ve bent so many times  
No, no, no, I don’t know what I would do without you  
Oh yeah  

It seems like we all have an angel  
It seems, it really seems to be you  
It seems that in this strange world  
It seems you’ve always been there  

Everything, everything revolves around you  
You’re the only one who sees the beauty well hidden behind the faces  
Everything, everything revolves around you  
You know how to read me; promise me you’ll never turn the page  

It seems like we all have an angel  
It seems, it really seems to be you  
It seems that in this strange world  
It seems you’ve always been there  

It seems like we all have an angel  
It seems, it really seems to be you  
It seems that in this strange world  
It seems you’ve always been there  

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
It seems  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
It seems
