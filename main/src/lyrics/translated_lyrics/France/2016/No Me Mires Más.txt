**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain: Kendji]  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
Don't play with danger  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
And you play with danger  

[Verse 1: Kendji]  
It's been over a week  
That he describes you like a poem  
He only talks about you  
He lives on a cloud  
Since you’ve been in his arms  
He’s found his smile again  
Since you are his future  
You’ve become his joy  
But everything changed when  
I realized he was talking about you  

[Pre-Chorus: Kendji Girac]  
But what have I done to God?  
There was only one night between us two  
Let’s not get too close to the fire  

[Refrain: Kendji Girac]  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
Don't play with danger  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
And you play with danger  

[Verse 2: Soprano]  
It’s already been over a week  
And I haven’t heard much from you  
Aren't you happy for me?  
You, who are my friend  
I feel you drifting away from me  
Every time I’m with her  
Your looks aren’t the same anymore  
I’m becoming paranoid, you my friend  
Did you stab me in the back?  

[Pre-Chorus: Soprano]  
But what have I done to God?  
Has there been something between them?  
Has our friendship caught fire?  

[Refrain: Kendji Girac]  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
Don't play with danger  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
And you play with danger  

[Soprano & Kendji Girac]  
Friend, friend, tell me you’re true  
If I’m not, may God throw me into the fire  
So tell me everything and cure my paranoia  
I loved her one night before you put a ring on her  
But why didn’t you tell me to my face?  
Because I’ve never seen you so happy  
You are my brother, no woman between us two  
Our friendship means more to me than her beautiful eyes  

[Pre-Chorus: Kendji Girac & Soprano]  
But what have we done to God?  
Our friendship almost caught fire  
No woman between us two  

[Refrain: Kendji Girac]  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
Don't play with danger  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
And you play with danger  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
Don't play with danger  
Don't look at me anymore, anymore  
I beg you, let me forget you  
I can't do that to him  
And you play with danger  

[Outro: Soprano]  
Friend, friend  
Friend, friend  
You play with danger  
Friend, friend  
Friend, friend  
You play with danger
