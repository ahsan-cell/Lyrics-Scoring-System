**[Intro]**  
I ask for your forgiveness  

**[Verse 1]**  
I've found some cracks  
I've made mistakes  
I let them happen  
I've been hurt  
I preached the false  
Yet I stayed true  
I climbed back up  
I clenched my fist  
Without letting it show  
I moved forward  
With my gaze far ahead  
Without losing hope  

**[Pre-Chorus 1]**  
I ask you to forget  
But I can't confide  
I'd like to shout it out  
I'm trapped by my pride  
Without admitting, without speaking  
I’ve run, I’ve run  
I’ve given everything for so many years  

**[Chorus]**  
I ask for your forgiveness  
For all that I may have done  
Yes, I'm sorry, if I often shut myself away  
Yes, I'm sorry, on my knees I pray  
Yes, I'm sorry  

**[Verse 2]**  
I reached out my hand  
Often with no return  
I learned to live  
I started from nothing  
Here the winds change  
I didn’t see it coming  
I let it all go  
For a better world  
I ask for your forgiveness  
I couldn't keep you  
I got lost elsewhere  
Here time drags on  

**[Pre-Chorus 2]**  
I did things against my will  
I thought I was innocent  
I didn’t hear your cries  
In fact, I was unaware  
Without admitting, without speaking  
I’ve run, I’ve run  
I’ve given everything for so many years  

**[Chorus]**  
I ask for your forgiveness  
For all that I may have done  
Yes, I'm sorry, if I often shut myself away  
Yes, I'm sorry, on my knees I pray  
Yes, I'm sorry  

**[Verse 3]**  
Don’t hold it against me, I’m like this  
Don’t leave, I’m here  
Don’t hold it against me, I’m like this  
Think of me, just once  
Tell me who are you to judge me?  
I’ve caused pain and I’ve hurt you  
You knew what I had, what I left behind  
Know that no one ever helped me  
Forgive me, if I turned my back on you  
Forgive me, I was pushed to make mistakes  

**[Chorus]**  
I ask for your forgiveness  
For all that I may have done  
Yes, I'm sorry, if I often shut myself away  
Yes, I'm sorry, on my knees I pray  
Yes, I'm sorry
