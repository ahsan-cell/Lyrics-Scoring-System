**Where is it?**

Where is happiness, where is it?  
Where is it?

I made love, I begged for change,  
I was waiting to be happy.  
I wrote songs, I had children,  
I did my best.  
I sulked, I pretended,  
We do what we can.  
I acted foolishly, it's true, I partied, yeah,  
I thought I was happy, but

There are all those nights without friends,  
When no one calls or comes by.  
It's Sunday night, in the rain,  
Like a fool in his bath,  
Trying to drown it, but it floats,  
That damn sorrow.  
So, I sing myself my sweetest notes and  
It'll be better tomorrow.

Where is happiness, where is it?  
Where is it?  
Where is happiness, where is it?  
Where is it?

I courted, I put on a show,  
I was waiting to be happy.  
I played the clown, it's true, and I did nothing,  
But it’s not getting better.  
I did good, I made mistakes,  
We do what we can.  
I went wild, I had fits of laughter, yeah,  
I thought I was happy, but

There are all those Christmas nights, where we smile politely,  
To shield from cruel life,  
All those children's laughter  
And those empty chairs that remind us  
Of what life takes away.  
So, I sing my most beautiful notes,  
It was better before.

Where is happiness, where is it?

Where is happiness, where is it?  
Where is it?  
Happiness is here, it’s here,  
It’s here.  
Happiness is here, it’s here!  
It’s here.  
Happiness is a candle,  
Don’t laugh too loud, by the way,  
You might blow it out.  
We want happiness, yes, we want it,  
Everyone wants to reach it.  
But happiness doesn’t make a sound, no, it doesn’t make a sound,  
No, it doesn’t.  
It’s silly, happiness, yeah, because it’s often only after that we know it was there.

Where is happiness, where is it?  
Where is it?  
Where is happiness, where is it?  
Where is it?

Happiness is here, it’s here,  
It’s here.  
Happiness is here, it’s here, yeah,  
It’s here.

Oh, but where is happiness?  
Where is happiness?  
Where is it?  
Where is it?

Oh, but where is happiness?  
But it’s here.  
Happiness is here, it’s here,  
And it’s here.  
Happiness is here, it’s here.
