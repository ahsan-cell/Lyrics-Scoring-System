**Translated Lyrics:**

To you, the girl who makes me  
So tough and so tender  
Who knows how to speak to me  
When I'm shut off  
When I want to hear nothing  
When my heart is soft  
When my heart is heavy  
With rains of sorrow  
And my soul soaked in steel  
When I'm lost and everything chains me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes my soul is caught  
In nets that torment me  
Sometimes my soul is gray  
And if tonight you ask me  

[Chorus]  
How's it going, it's going, it's going, it's going  
On my planet  
I'll answer you, it's going, it's going, it's going  
So-so  
The beers, the wines that I drink in vain  
Don't taste like a party  
But as long as our hearts keep beating, beating  
It's going, it's going  

[Verse 2]  
To you, my friend  
The only man who held my hand  
When every day  
I worried about  
The tomorrows  
You, whom I know, even when hurt  
Are always there  
To carry me  
To ease  
My pain until I feel light  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Sometimes my soul is in crisis  
My joy for living, I want it back  
Happiness scorns me  
And if tonight you ask me  

[Chorus]  
How's it going, it's going, it's going, it's going  
On my planet  
I'll answer you, it's going, it's going, it's going  
So-so  
The beers, the wines that I drink in vain  
Don't taste like a party  
But as long as our hearts keep beating, beating  
It's going, it's going  

[Bridge]  
To those I've  
Sometimes neglected  
Maybe a bit free  
So as not to disturb  
Me, the castaway  
On my drunken boat  
I have no buoy  
No distress signal;  
I'm not good at caresses  
But if you ever ask me  
When everything hurts  

[Chorus]  
How's it going, it's going, it's going, it's going  
On my planet  
I'll answer you, it's going, it's going, it's going  
So-so  
The beers, the wines that I drink in vain  
Don't taste like a party  
But as long as our hearts keep beating, beating  
It's going, it's going  
How's it going, it's going, it's going, it's going  
On my planet  
I'll answer you, it's going, it's going, it's going  
So-so  
The beers, the wines that I drink in vain  
Don't taste like a party  
But as long as our hearts keep beating, beating  
It's going, it's going
