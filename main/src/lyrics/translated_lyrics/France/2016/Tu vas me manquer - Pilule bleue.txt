**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Another morning wondering how I’ll fill all this emptiness you left behind  
I feel like the day is bound to be long, and I have no one to spend it with  
I can’t bear this solitude anymore, I miss you, I have no one to confide in  
I spend my time looking out the window, and I still don’t see you coming home  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Everything feels false, I’m losing my words, what will become of me?  
I hold on to hope of seeing you again in the near future  

[Chorus]  
I wait for you as if you were going to come back  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  
The memories keep haunting me  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  
It’s been so long since I’ve waited for you to return, but  
You’re fading from my memory  
I wait for you as if you were going to come back  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  

[Verse 2]  
Another whole night dreaming of your return, but waking up plunges me back into this nightmare  
Without you, I’m bored; I smile when I think of the talks we had morning and night  
I think of you so much that sometimes I feel like I hear the sound of your voice  
The more the years go by, the more I realize how lucky I was to have you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Everything feels false, I’m losing my words, what will become of me?  
I hold on to hope of seeing you again in the near future  

[Chorus]  
I wait for you as if you were going to come back  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  
The memories keep haunting me  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  
It’s been so long since I’ve waited for you to return, but  
You’re fading from my memory  
I wait for you as if you were going to come back  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  

[Bridge]  
I will wait for you again, and again, and again as long as my body can bear your absence  
I will wait for you again, and again, and again, I’ll wait for you to come back  

[Chorus]  
I wait for you as if you were going to come back  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  
The memories keep haunting me  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you  
It’s been so long since I’ve waited for you to return, but  
You’re fading from my memory  
I wait for you as if you were going to come back  
I’m going to miss you, I’m going to miss you
