**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I traded my claps and my snaps  
For blisters and puddles  
A backpack to forget  
That before, it was you who weighed me down  
What carries me, what pulls me along  
Is my pain, my pain more than my anger  
Oh my road, oh my plain  
God, how I love it  

[Chorus]  
Spinning, and spinning in my head  
The images of the feature film  
Where you are beautiful and I the beast  
And the beauty is never wise  
When you say it's my fault  
That I never knew how to love you  
To hell with you and your apostles  
I'm leaving  

[Verse 2]  
And what beads on my forehead  
Drops of rain, drops of cold  
Give me wings, give me  
The desire to distance myself from you  
And my tears, and my weapons  
Are my pain, my pain more than my anger  
And my tears, my tears  
God, how it hurts  

[Chorus]  
Spinning, and spinning in my head  
The images of the feature film  
Where you are beautiful and I the beast  
And the beauty is never wise  
When you say it's my fault  
That I never knew how to love you  
To hell with you and your apostles  
I'm leaving  
I'm leaving  
I'm leaving  

[Outro]  
And spinning, and spinning in my head  
The images of the feature film  
Where you are beautiful and I the beast  
And the beauty is never wise  
When you say it's my fault  
That I never knew how to love you  
To hell with you and your apostles  
I'm leaving  
I'm leaving
