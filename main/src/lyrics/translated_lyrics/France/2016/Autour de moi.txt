**Translated Lyrics:**

A light to finally see…
The night, the day, nothing has changed
Around me ahahahahaaa…
“And under the moon in the starry sky?”
No, nothing, if you don’t want to believe it
The night, one day will change everything
Deep inside you there la lalaaa…?

Yeah, under the rain, in the wind, my heart stirs, can you hear?

Under the rain, in the wind, my heart stirs, can you hear?
Under the rain, as time goes by, my body tires, can you feel?
Under the rain, in the wind, my heart stirs, can you hear?
Under the rain, as time goes by, my body tires, can you feel?

How long? How will our gardens bloom
Under the fruit of chance?
Do you really have no memory
Deep inside you? ahahahah
How many tears? How will our dreams grow
Lost in these billions?
One day life will make you smile and

Around you…

I cry, you don’t see me
I scream, you don’t hear me
I suffer, you don’t even feel
Right under your feet
I cry, you don’t see me
I scream, you don’t hear me
I suffer, don’t forget me
Right under your eyes
