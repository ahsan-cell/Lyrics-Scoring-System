**Translated Lyrics:**

The Madonna in the north  
And the lake takes shape  
Courageous efforts  
Where nothing breathes  
Body against body  
Sky against lashes  
The forest twists  
The horizon sighs  

[Chorus] x2  
To love you by the edge of the lake  
Your heart on my body that breathes  
As long as men look at us  
Lovers of shadow and the worst  

[Verse 2]  
I will return strong  
To surprise the peak  
The river and the gold  
Take root here  
Iâ€™ve deceived death  
The slope is easy  
Hold me tight again  
So my angels waver  

[Chorus]  
To love you by the edge of the lake  
Your heart on my body that breathes  
As long as men look at us  
Lovers of shadow and the worst  

[Bridge] x2  
If tomorrow you regret  
The scarred mirror  
That the lake reflects you  
Promise me to forget  

[Chorus] x2  
To love you by the edge of the lake  
Your heart on my body that breathes  
As long as men look at us  
Lovers of shadow and the worst
