**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Beyond the storms, I set off on a journey  
My soul in the wind, with an elephant's heart  
I left this place to meet life  
To be alive, immensely  

[Refrain 1]  
On the shoulders of giants  
With an elephant's heart  

To see beyond our lives...  

[Verse 2]  
Resting on a rock, letting go  
With the steps of giants, an elephant's heart  
We'll take our time to discover life  
To love people, immensely  

[Chorus 1]  

[Post-Chorus]  
Astonished heart  
Tasting the Milky Way  
Light-hearted  
Light-hearted...  

[Bridge]  
I will put all my weight to tip life  
To the right side, with a light heart  
Seeing men as the fingers of a hand that builds  
For you and me, our utopias  

[Chorus 2]  
I have an elephant's heart  
Immensely  

I have an elephant's heart...  

[Outro]  
Beyond the storms, I set off on a journey  
My soul in the wind, with an elephant's heart  
I left this place to meet life  
To be alive...
