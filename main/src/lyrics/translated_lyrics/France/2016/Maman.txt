**Translated Lyrics:**

Lovers move from bed to bed  
In hotels, in parking lots  
To escape all this melancholy  
The heart of the cities looks so worn  

Blues hits, phone calls  
Everything will start again in spring  
Except for the indelible loves  

Dreams pile up in the subways  
The skyscrapers look down on us  
Like a bird behind bars  

[Chorus]  
I’m not well in my head, mom  
I’ve lost the taste for celebration, mom  
Look at how your daughter’s made, mom  
I can’t find meaning in my quest, mom  

[Verse 2]  
At the hour when the bars fill up  
That same hour when hearts empty out  
Those nights when promises are woven  
As quickly as they are squandered  

Blues hits, phone calls  
Everything will start again in spring  
Except for the indelible loves  

Dreams pile up in the subways  
The skyscrapers look down on us  
Like a bird behind bars  

[Chorus]  
I’m not well in my head, mom  
I’ve lost the taste for celebration, mom  
Look at how your daughter’s made, mom  
I can’t find meaning in my quest, mom  

[Outro]  
Look at how your daughter’s made, mom  
I can’t find meaning in my quest, mom
