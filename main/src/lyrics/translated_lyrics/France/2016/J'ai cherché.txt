**Translated Lyrics:**

You, you  
I searched for meaning in my existence  
I left my innocence behind  
I ended up with a heart defenseless  
I sought love and recognition  
I paid the price of silence  
I hurt myself and I start again  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You gave me the desire to be myself  
Gave meaning to my whys  
You killed the fear that was sleeping there  
That was sleeping there in my arms  

**[Chorus]**  
You  
You’re the one that’s making me strong  
I’ll be looking, looking for you  
Like the melody of my song  
You  
You’re the one that’s making me strong  
I’ll be looking, looking for you  
Like the melody of my song  

**[Verse 2]**  
I searched for meaning, a point of reference  
Divided into two hemispheres  
Like a mistake of the universe  
I threw so many bottles into the sea  
I drank so many bitter liqueurs  
That my lips have turned to stone  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You gave me the desire to be myself  
Gave meaning to my whys  
You killed the fear that was sleeping there  
That was sleeping there in my arms  

**[Chorus]**  
You  
You’re the one that’s making me strong  
I’ll be looking, looking for you  
Like the melody of my song  
You  
You’re the one that’s making me strong  
I’ll be looking, looking for you  
Like the melody of my song  

**[Bridge]**  
In the wake of our wounds  
And our nonchalance  
It’s when we no longer believe at all  
That we find a lost paradise within us  
Oh, you, you, you, you  

**[Chorus]**  
You  
You’re the one that’s making me strong  
I’ll be looking, looking for you  
Like the melody of my song  
Like the melody of my song  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You gave me the desire to be myself  
Gave meaning to my whys (You)  
You killed the fear that was sleeping there  
That was sleeping there in my arms  

**[Chorus]**  
You  
You’re the one that’s making me strong  
I’ll be looking, looking, looking for you  
Like the melody of my song
