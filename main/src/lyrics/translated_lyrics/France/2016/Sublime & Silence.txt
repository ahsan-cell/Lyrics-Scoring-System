**Translated Lyrics:**

Sublime and silence  
Around me, you dance  
And I forget  
It's you that I think of  
Of your burning lips  
When you smile  

[Chorus]  
The emptiness would have been enough  
The emptiness would have been enough  

[Verse 2]  
Sublime and silence  
Everything trembles around you  
And everything ends  
It's me that you think of  
Of our white intoxications  
I flee Paris  

[Chorus]  
The emptiness would have been enough  
The emptiness would have been enough  

[Verse 3]  
But I know that you remain  
In the flowers I leave for you  
After the night  
Violence and promise  
It's all that you hate  
Death too  

[Chorus]  
The emptiness would have been enough  
The emptiness would have been enough  

[Verse 4]  
I caress your absence  
The mountain and the wandering  
And then the boredom  
The river resembles you  
At least in appearance  
Yet you flee  

[Chorus]  
The emptiness would have been enough  
The emptiness would have been enough  

[Verse 5]  
But I know that you remain  
In the flowers I leave for you  
After the night  
Violence and promise  
It's all that you hate  
Death too  

[Chorus]  
The emptiness would have been enough  
The emptiness would have been enough  

[Verse 6]  
But I know that you remain  
In the flowers I leave for you  
After the night  
Violence and promise  
It's all that you hate  
Death too  

[Outro]  
But I know that you remain  
But I know that you remain
