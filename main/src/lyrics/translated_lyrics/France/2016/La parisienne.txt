**Translated Lyrics:**

She’s been living in Paris for less than three months  
But she already knows it all, the manual  
She uses a bunch of words I don’t understand  
Rides a Vespa  

Her friends have strange names, Béné, Alix, FX, and Lise-Ange...  
It’s not their names that bother me, nor their bangs  
She keeps telling me we need to catch up  
That we should brunch together one of these days  
That we should check out an exhibit at 104, Lary Clark  
Why not?  
But not tomorrow  
Because she’s overbooked, always stuck on her MacBook  
And when she tells me we can meet on Facebook, that’s the last straw  

She lives in Paris  
She has white Converse  
I don’t understand what she says anymore  
She lives in Paris, let’s hope nothing changes  

She lives in Paris  
She has white Converse  
I don’t understand what she says anymore  
She lives in Paris, let’s hope nothing changes  

It’s not that I’m criticizing  
It’s so different past the périphérique (the ring road around Paris)  
The music isn’t the same, the outfits aren’t either  
Her mom, her friends, and their tonic vodkas  
I see her less often because she, yes  
Goes to the sea for Easter  
Her friends have big houses, Saint Briac  
I don’t know it  

Me, my face, my slang, and my accent  
I know, it makes her well-meaning friends smile  
And yet, I often wait for her in the wind  
I wish she’d be a bit like she was before  
But her and her Velib (bike-sharing service) are all organic tomatoes and her iPhone  

Her Boston terrier  
While the rain beats down on me  
As I struggle for hours at the intercom  
But there’s no one  

**Chorus (x2)**  
She lives in Paris  
She has white Converse  
I don’t understand what she says anymore  
She lives in Paris, let’s hope nothing changes  

Madame is chic  
Aperitif, pareo, by the Seine  
Madame complicates life, being a bohemian  

Madame is chic  
American Apparel, H&M  
She’s a hipster chic  
But where is the lady I love?  

She lives in Paris  
She has white Converse  
I don’t understand what she says anymore  
She lives in Paris, let’s hope nothing changes  

She lives in Paris  
I think she’s forgetting me  
She has new friends, you know  
New clothes  
And I’m hanging out by the Seine  
But where is the lady I love?  
I don’t understand what she says anymore  
She lives in Paris, let’s hope she changes
