**[Verse 1]**  
Sir, before my fall, I was truly rich and happy  
I was the greatest advisor to men, even in high places  
They called upon my services to take from the unfortunate  
Everyone signed with me, closing their eyes  
On earth, sin is a profitable business  
I made my profits selling desire and fire  
Yes, the misfortune of some brings joy to the most corrupt  
I offered power to the wallet of the most generous  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
But times have changed  
Men no longer need me  
Yes, times have changed  
I've lost everything since men do far worse than I ever did  

**[Chorus]**  
The devil no longer dresses in Prada  
The devil no longer dresses in Prada  
Men have picked his pockets  
Taken his wife and his kids  
He has no hold on the globe  
Since they took away his job  
No, the devil no longer dresses in Prada  
The devil no longer dresses in Prada  
Men have picked his pockets  
Taken his wife and his kids  
He has no hold on the globe  
Since they took away his job  

**[Verse 2]**  
Sir, today's men have surpassed all my wishes  
Some exercise their murderous madness in the name of God  
Oil is a legitimate reason to set things ablaze  
Some countries shrink, but letâ€™s stay silent  
Despite its wealth, Africa still has a void  
Television has stolen the education of their brats  
The internet burns neurons much more than weed  
Hell is no longer with me, but indeed with you, sir  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
But times have changed  
Men no longer need me  
Yes, times have changed  
I've lost everything since men do far worse than I ever did  

**[Chorus]**  
The devil no longer dresses in Prada  
The devil no longer dresses in Prada  
Men have picked his pockets  
Taken his wife and his kids  
He has no hold on the globe  
Since they took away his job  
No, the devil no longer dresses in Prada  
The devil no longer dresses in Prada  
Men have picked his pockets  
Taken his wife and his kids  
He has no hold on the globe  
Since they took away his job  

**[Outro] (x2)**  
Yes, the student has surpassed his master  
Yes, the student has surpassed his master  
Yes, hell is much bigger on earth  
Since men do worse than Lucifer
