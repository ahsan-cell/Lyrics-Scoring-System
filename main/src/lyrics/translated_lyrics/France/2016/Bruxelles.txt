**Translated Lyrics:**

If I didn't know you yet  
Our adventure would be worth gold  
If we met just barely  
My love, what a stroke of luck  
I would have a delicious tongue  
I would have a sweet part of me  
That I now find repulsive  
Oh my love, what have we done?

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I’m one of those who stay on the sidelines  
I know we were meant to laugh again  
I’m one of those, but you’re one of those  
Who remain stuck in Brussels

**[Chorus]**  
If I were the one, you are the only  
If I stay here, you go back to Brussels  
If I were the one, you are the only  
If I stay here, you go back to Brussels

**[Verse 2]**  
If I knew nothing about you  
I’d be at peace for us to be so  
If we had never met  
I’d be checking you out without you knowing  
I’d have easy compliments  
I’d be the strong man and the docile one  
That last one I can no longer be  
My love, I’ve lost us

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I’m one of those who stay on the sidelines  
I know we were meant to laugh again  
I’m one of those, but you’re one of those  
Who remain stuck in Brussels

**[Chorus]**  
If I were the one, you are the only  
If I stay here, you go back to Brussels  
If I were the one, you are the only  
If I stay here, you go back to Brussels

**[Verse 3]**  
And when you dance, it’s dripping  
You’re a gift for the eyes  
You’re on a Mondrian canvas that I ruin with a thousand colors  
I took you shamelessly and without a plan  
Just like that, for happiness  
I even imagine us camping  
In Brussels

**[Pre-Chorus 2]**  
There are those who stay at the port  
There are those who still laugh  
There are those and there are those  
Who remain stuck in Brussels

**[Chorus]**  
If I were the one, you are the only  
If I stay here, you go back to Brussels  
If I were the one, you are the only  
If I stay here, you go back to Brussels
