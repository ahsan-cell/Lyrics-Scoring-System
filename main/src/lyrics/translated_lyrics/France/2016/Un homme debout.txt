**Translated Lyrics:**

If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?  
It's so cold outside, can you feel it?  
There was a time when I was like you  
Despite all my struggles, I remain a man standing tall  

**[Verse 1]**  
Pray that I make it through  
Pray that I feel better too  
Don't blame me for my plight  
Don't shut the door on my light  
Yes, I live day by day  
From squat to squat, a troubadour's way  
If I sing, it's for you to see me  
Just a little hello would mean so much to me  
I see you pass by when I'm sitting down  
You're standing, rushing, I appreciate your frown  
A little glance, a little smile  
You don't take the time, just run all the while  

**[Chorus]**  
If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?  
It's so cold outside, can you feel it?  
There was a time when I was like you  
Despite all my struggles, I remain a man standing tall  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Lalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  

**[Verse 2]**  
Thank you kindly for the coin  
Right now it's tough, I must admit  
I will get through this, I swear it  
One day I'll have a roof, an address to fit  
Even if between you and me it's hard, I stress  
My spirits aren't always high, time's a mess  
But what can I do? Except drown in my sorrow  
And promises, do you want more?  
This is my life, I've taken hits to the face  
Rest assured, if I fall down, everyone passes, no one shows grace  
Honestly, apart from the kids who look at me strange  
Everyone finds it normal that I beg for change  
Don't hold it against me, but sometimes all I want is to give up  

**[Chorus]**  
If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?  
It's so cold outside, can you feel it?  
There was a time when I was like you  
Despite all my struggles, I remain a man standing tall  

**[Bridge]**  
Pray that I make it through  
Pray that I feel better too  
Don't blame me for my plight  
Don't shut the door on my light  

**[Chorus]**  
If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?  
It's so cold outside, can you feel it?  
There was a time when I was like you  
Despite all my struggles, I remain a man standing tall  
If I fall asleep, will you wake me up?  
It's so cold outside, can you feel it?  
There was a time when I was like you  
Despite all my struggles, I remain a man standing tall  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Lalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  

**[Outro]**  
Lalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala  
Lalala, lalalala  
Lalalala, lalalala
