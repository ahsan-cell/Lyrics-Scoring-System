**Always Alive, Rest Assured**  
Always smiling, still standing tall  
I’m back on my feet, revived after all  

**[Verse 1]**  
All those who fall around me  
It’s a massacre, it’s Guernica*  
All those who fall, dropping like flies  
And here I am, still alive  

**[Chorus]**  
Always alive, rest assured  
Always smiling, still standing tall  
He’s not born or badly off  
The fool who thinks he can bury me  

**[Verse 2]**  
I don’t do TV anymore, I don’t even have the net  
Stopped talking to radios and newspapers  
They thought I was gone, believed I was forgotten  
Tell those idiots: I’m still singing  

**[Verse 3]**  
And all these bounty hunters  
Paparazzi lying in wait  
Who bring me down, and only print  
Gossip, just nonsense  
All these rumors about my health  
We won’t make a fuss over it  
And let him who’s never stumbled  
Throw me the first beer  

**[Chorus]**  
Always alive, rest assured  
Always smiling, still standing tall  
He’s not born or badly off  
The idiot who wants to replace me  

**[Verse 4]**  
I always have to be careful  
Behind every bush  
From all these photographers  
Who think you’re a fool  
They buried me  
A bit too soon  
Tell those bastards: I’m still singing  

**[Bridge]**  
But I’ve never forgotten you  
And for those who missed me  
You loyal ones, I come back to say thank you  
I missed you too  
So happy to see you again  
I want to keep going, for heaven's sake  
Keep writing and singing  
Singing for all the wild ones  

**[Chorus]**  
Always alive, rest assured  
Always smiling, still standing tall  
He’s not born or badly off  
The fool who thinks he can bury me  

**[Verse 5]**  
For a few years now, I’ve stepped away  
I live near the lavender under the olive trees  
They thought I was gone, believed I was forgotten  
Those idiots can keep on babbling  
On my little path, I keep on singing
