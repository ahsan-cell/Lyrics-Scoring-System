**Translated Lyrics:**

At night, from the top of my tower  
With my head in the stars  
The next day at school in the yard  
I’d say: "Buddy, pass me the ball!"  
Mom would tell me: "Do your homework"  
I’d reply: "Just wait and see"  
I’d make her read each of my poems  
One day in Paris, I’ll sing that I love her  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my face and my backpack  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my dreams and my songs  

**[Chorus]**  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my face and my backpack  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my dreams and my songs  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming (and my dreams)  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming  
Pa-Pa Paris, we’re coming  

**[Verse 2]**  
This morning, on the platform  
I’m waiting for the train to Paris  
On my head, my beanie  
Thoughts about life  
Over there, people don’t care about anything, anything  
In the bars, they drink their drinks, their drinks  
To the health of all their loves  
Which of course will last forever  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my face and my backpack  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my dreams and my songs  

**[Chorus]**  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my face and my backpack  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my dreams and my songs  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming (and my dreams)  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming  
Pa-Pa Paris, we’re coming  

**[Verse 3]**  
I also want to not care about anything  
In the bars, go have some drinks  
Forget that after the ring road*  
Life is a little sadder  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  

**[Chorus]**  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my face and my backpack  
Paris, Paris, we’re coming  
Me, my dreams and my songs  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming (and my dreams)  
Paris, Paris, we, we, we’re coming  
Pa-Pa Paris, we’re coming  

*Note: "the ring road" refers to the périphérique, a major road encircling Paris.
