**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Daddy Yankee]  
D-D-D-D-D-DY  
Play N' Skillz  
Run!

[Pre-Chorus: Daddy Yankee]  
What's your name, baby?  
Since I saw you, I knew you were for me  
Tell your friends we're ready to go  
We'll continue this at the after party  
What's your name, baby? (Brr, brr)  
Since I saw you, I knew you were for me  
Tell your friends we're ready to go (Let’s go!)  
We'll continue this at the after party (Su-su, hey)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it  
Shake that poom-poom, girl  
She's a killer; when she dances, she wants the whole world to see her  
I like your poom-poom, girl (Let’s go!)  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it  
Shake that poom-poom, girl  
She’s got adrenaline; in the middle of the dance floor, come on, do whatever you want  
I like your poom-poom, girl (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Daddy Yankee]  
I see you're all alone, come keep me company  
The night is ours, you know it (You know!)  
I’m feeling the urge  
To dance with you, baby, that ram-pam-pam, yeah  
That move is criminal, it’s a crime (Oh)  
I have to arrest you because once I start, I can’t stop (Eh)  
You’ve got that criminality, but I’ll give you fatality  
Live the movie floating in my gravity  
Daddy sets the rules; you have to obey  
Baby, there’s no pause, what are you going to do?  
Go back, go back, go back  
Go forward and back (Eh, hey-hey-hey)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it  
Shake that poom-poom, girl (Girl)  
She's a killer; when she dances, she wants the whole world to see her  
I like your poom-poom, girl  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it (Take it easy)  
Shake that poom-poom, girl  
She’s got adrenaline; in the middle of the dance floor, come on, do whatever you want  
I like your poom-poom, girl

[Verse 2: Daddy Yankee]  
You’re on fire, and I’ve got the candle  
Call 911, the soles are burning  
You drive me crazy when you model that little skirt  
Baby, you’re sick, but your show doesn’t get canceled  
They call you the queen of the party  
That body has a lot of flair  
Show me a move, don’t stop, come on, go for it! (Yo)  
We’re two bandits between the party and romance  
And drop it, DJ, again so we can dance  
Go back, go back, go back  
Go forward and back (Hey, eh, hey)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee]  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it (Take it easy)  
Shake that poom-poom, girl (Girl)  
She's a killer; when she dances, she wants the whole world to see her  
I like your poom-poom, girl  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it (Take it easy)  
Shake that poom-poom, girl  
She’s got adrenaline; in the middle of the dance floor, come on, do whatever you want (Hey, hey, hey, eh)  
I like your poom-poom, girl (Snow!)

[Verse 3: Snow & Daddy Yankee]  
Come with a nice young lady (What?)  
Intelligent, yes, she’s gentle and irie (Fire!)  
Everywhere I go, I never leave her at all (Tell her!)  
Yes, Daddy Snow, I’m the roaming dance man (Snow!)  
Roaming between dancing in the nation (Prr, prr, prr!)  
You never knew that Daddy Snow is the boom shakata (What-what-what-what?)  
I never lay down flat in a cardboard box (Let’s go, let’s go!)  
Yes, Daddy Yankee, I’m reaching out to the top (What?)

[Chorus: Daddy Yankee & Snow]  
Take it easy  
I want to see how she moves it (Move it)  
Shake that poom-poom, girl (Girl)  
She's a killer; when she dances, she wants the whole world to see her  
I like your poom-poom, girl  
Take it easy  
You already know Daddy and me
