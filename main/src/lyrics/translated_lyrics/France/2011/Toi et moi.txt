**Translated Lyrics:**

Lying on the sand, catching some air  
Feeling the sea spray, staying a little longer  
Staying until my body is salted by the sea  

**[Chorus]**  
It would just be you and me  
Right here or over there  
Without worthy rules and without faith  
Whenever you want, we can go  
All the colors of the sky  
Full of bottles  
Rum, wine, and honey  
Whenever you want, we can go  

And hidden by the dunes  
Between land and sea  
Stealing a bit of peace  
With refrains to the sea  
Of course, you would be there  
Me nestled against you  
I’ll tell you this dream whenever you want, we can go  

**[Chorus]**  
It would just be you and me  
Right here or over there  
Without worthy rules and without faith  
Whenever you want, we can go  
All the colors of the sky  
Full of bottles  
Rum, wine, and honey  
Whenever you want, we can go  

If we live hidden, if we live damned  
And if time counts, we’ll frustrate our shames  
Over there you can lie, over there you can cheat  
Over there we can stain, over there... we can  

**[Chorus]**  
Just be you and me  
Right here or over there  
Without worthy rules and without faith  
Whenever you want, we can go  
All the colors of the sky  
Full of bottles  
Rum, wine, and honey  
Whenever you want, we can go  

It would just be you and me  
Right here or over there  
Without worthy rules and without faith  
Whenever you want, we can go  
It would just be you and me  
Right here or over there  
Without worthy rules and without faith  
Whenever you want, we can go  

Whenever you want, we can go
