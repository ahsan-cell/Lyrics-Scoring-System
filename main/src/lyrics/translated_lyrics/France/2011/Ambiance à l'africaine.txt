**Translated Lyrics:**

Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if it feels good to you  
Then it’s the same for us  
Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if you don’t know us  
We are Magic System  

Magic System, the magic that sets the mood  
Don’t worry  
There’s no fuss, we’re with you  
We want to jump, oh Nikasso  
We want to dance  
Oh so so so Nikasso  
And light up the place  
Bring life to the spot  
We want to sing  
We want to shout  

Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if it feels good to you  
Then it’s the same for us  
Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if you don’t know us  
We are Magic System  

If you’re dressed up, we don’t care about trends  
What we want is to get you in the mood  
We want to jump, oh Nikasso  
We want to dance  
Oh so so so Nikasso  
And light up the place  
Bring life to the spot  
We want to sing  
We want to shout  

Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if it feels good to you  
Then it’s the same for us  
Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if you don’t know us  
We are Magic System  

Hey DJ, because here in Abidjan  
When we want to say "let’s dance"  
We say "si abeler"  
That’s why I’m asking everyone to "si abeler"  
Let’s go together, everyone  

A ma si abeler, A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler, A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler, A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler, A ma si abeler  

Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if it feels good to you  
Then it’s the same for us  
Raise the level  
African vibes  
And if you don’t know us  
We are Magic System  

A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler  
A ma si abeler  
Excuse me, it’s the snow that’s tiring me  

(Note: "Si abeler" is a local expression from Ivory Coast meaning to dance or enjoy the music.)
