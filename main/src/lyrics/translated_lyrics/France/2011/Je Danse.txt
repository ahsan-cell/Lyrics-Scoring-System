**Translated Lyrics:**

I have a bit of trouble finding sleep  
When I picture you in those mountains and wonders  
So, I put on a jacket and pour a glass of vodka  
Never mind if I smell of fear and tobacco  

**[Chorus]**  
I dance until I laugh, I pray the day never returns  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory  
I dance until I laugh, at night life is less grim  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory  

**[Verse 2]**  
Alone, I head to the center of the city and the universe  
I wander in circles in the belly  
Of this world that spins upside down, hey  
Drunk, I sweat on the dance floor and scream my love pains  
Into the ear of backup singers from a bad taste hit  
Oh, of bad taste  

**[Chorus]**  
I dance until I laugh, I pray the day never returns  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory, yeah  
I dance until I laugh, at night life is less grim  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory  

**[Bridge]**  
Everyone doesn't care about my reasons  
At night, fewer questions are asked  
In the cradle of little glories  
We want dreams, not hope  
Everyone doesn't care about my reasons  
At night, fewer questions are asked  
Wolves don’t give names  
They piss everywhere and then leave  
We're still ahead  
As soon as we know a few dance steps  
I’d love to spin luck around  
And whirl my trance partners  
But it’s not yet tonight  
That a few steps will replace beauty or power  
And I go home  
And my bathtub is a cove  
And on TV, it’s Africa  
And I miss you, and the music in my ears is panic  
Tonight, again, I was mad at you  
Tonight, again, I disappointed myself  
I played on the edge hoping to fall from the clouds  
But I still miss you, I miss you!  

**[Chorus]**  
I dance until I laugh, I pray the day never returns  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory, yeah  
I dance until I laugh, at night life is less grim  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory  

**[Outro]**  
Honestly, I'm less afraid of vampires than your memory, yeah  
I dance, dance, I dance, dance  
I pray the day never returns  
I dance, dance
