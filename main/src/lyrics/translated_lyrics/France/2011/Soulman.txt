**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I don't have Spike Lee's gaze  
I don't have Da Vinci's genius  
I don't have my feet on the ground  
The patience of my banker  
I don't have those things  
I don't have Gandhi's wisdom  
The confidence of Muhammad Ali  
I don't have a gangster's soul  
The kindness of Abb√© Pierre  
Nor the aura of Guevara  

[Chorus]  
I'm just a soul man  
Listen to this, baby  
I'm not a superman  
Far from it  
Just me, my dreams  
I have nothing else to offer  
But I know that in reality, that's already enough  

[Verse 2]  
I don't have the looks of magazines  
I don't have Charlie Chaplin's humor  
I don't have innate knowledge  
The know-how of Bocuse  
No, I don't have those things  
I don't have Neil Armstrong's luck  
I don't have King Kong's stature  
Several strings to my bow  
The fervor of Rosa Parks  
Nor Mandela's courage  

[Chorus]  
I'm just a soul man  
Listen to this, baby  
I'm not a superman  
Far from it  
Just me, my dreams  
I have nothing else to offer  
But I know that in reality, that's already enough  
I'm just a soul man  
Listen to this, baby  
I'm not a superman  
Far from it  
Just me, my dreams  
I have nothing else to offer  
But I know that in reality, that's already, ah, that's already enough, yeah  

[Verse 3]  
I would have liked to be like them  
To be extraordinary  
I tried my best, I did what I could  
But no matter what I do, in the end, yeah  

[Chorus]  
I'm just a soul man  
Listen to this, baby  
I'm not a superman  
Far from it (Oh, no)  
Just me, my dreams  
I have nothing else to offer  
But I know that in reality, that's already enough (That's already enough)  
I'm just a soul man  
Listen to this, baby (No, no, no, no)  
I'm not a superman  
Far from it  
Just me, my dreams, yeah, yeah  
But I know that in reality, that's already enough, no  

[Outro]  
Oh, huh  
No, no, no, no, no, no, no  
Just me, my dreams  
But I know that in reality, that's already enough, ooh
