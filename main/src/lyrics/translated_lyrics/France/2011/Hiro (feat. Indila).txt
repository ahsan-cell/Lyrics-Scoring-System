**I Would Have Liked to Travel Through Time**

**[Verse 1]**  
If I had the power of Hiro Nakamura,  
I would have gone to relive the birth of Lenny and Inaya.  
I would have been in Sanaa,  
To boycott the takeoff of the Yemenia A310.  
I would have gone to see my grandfather one last time,  
To tell him I’m taking care of his daughter, not to worry.  
I would have gone to see Martin Luther King,  
After his speech, show him the photo of Barack Obama.  
I would have been at the Harlem temple,  
To push Malcolm off the stage before a bullet hit him.  
I would have been in Mandela's cell,  
To tell him to hang in there, your ideas will be president of South Africa.  
In love with Lady Diana,  
I would have created a massive traffic jam under the Alma bridge.  
I would have been in the Bahamas,  
Not for vacation but to empty Aaliyah's plane hold.

I would have liked to travel through time,

I would have gone to puncture Coluche's motorcycle tires.  
I would have welcomed Muhammad in Medina,  
Then gone to see the Red Sea, let Moses pass.  
I would have been at the birth of Mary's son,  
Two hours later, march for salt with Gandhi.  
I would have sat beside Rosa Parks,  
Then to Woodstock to experience a live Jimi Hendrix.  
I would have been at the Motown anniversary,  
To see Michael do the moonwalk.  
I would have been in New York,  
To trigger a bomb alert at 7 o'clock in the Twin Towers.  
I would have been in Iraq,  
Teaching journalists to aim better with their shoes.  
I would have been in Afghanistan,  
Throwing away the cameras from the last interview with Commander Massoud.  
I would have been in Angola,  
To tell Adebayor's team not to take the road.  
I would have been in Clichy-sous-Bois,  
Unplugging the EDF transformer before Zyed and Bouna arrived.  
I would have been with Kunta Kinte or on Gorée,  
To give them rifles before the colonizers arrived.  
I would have gone to see the African soldiers,  
To tell them their children are called filthy immigrants.  
I would have been in Austria,  
I would have done everything to ensure Adolf Hitler's parents never met.
