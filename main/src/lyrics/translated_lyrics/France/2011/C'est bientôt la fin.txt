**Translated Lyrics:**

Put some makeup on your pale ideas  
We're going to make the stars sway  
Much higher  
Much higher, still  
Tonight is the big night  
Let’s go watch the drums fall  
The fanfare of the court soldiers  
Sounds off-key  
Sounds off-key, again, again, again, again, again, again  
Again, again  

Come on, let’s go  
It’s soon the end  
Of this world  
That hears nothing  
Come on, let’s go  
Sound the alarm  
Make their old speeches whirl  
Come dance, it’s our turn  
Tonight is the grand evening  
Our dreams are dressed in velvet  
We rush for a new start  
Much more beautiful  
Much more beautiful, again, again, again, again, again  
Again, again  
Again, again  

I’ve drunk love  
With a bitter breath  
I’ve seen the towers  
Fall to the ground  
I’ve seen black gold  
Bleed the sea  
All eyes  
On the ephemeral  
I see the new day bloom  
I believe in the laughter  
Of the fool up there  
I want to grasp  
All the mysteries  
And free myself  
From the ephemeral, from the ephemeral  
Tonight is the grand ball  
Put some makeup on your pale ideas  
We're going to make the stars sway  
Much higher  
Much higher  

Come on, let’s go  
It’s soon the end  
Of this world  
That hears nothing  
Come on, let’s go  
Sound the alarm  
Make their old speeches whirl  
Come dance, it’s our turn  
Come on, let’s go  
It’s soon the end  
Of this world  
That hears nothing  
Come on, let’s go  
Sound the alarm  
Let’s love each other on their ruins  
Let’s love each other for a new world
