**Translated Lyrics:**

The anger is palpable, the slope is slippery  
Oh, that finger pointing at me when nothing goes right  
We all know how this will end  

But who among us will take the first step?  
Sometimes, I fear for us when we’re this low  
When a little spark ignites everything, me myself above all  
We won’t let go, don’t let go, don’t let go  

There’s like a spark in the sky tonight  
I feel the earth tremble, the apocalypse is tonight  
We seem set for war, set for war  
We should take the time to calm down...  
There’s like a spark in the sky tonight  
I feel the earth tremble, the apocalypse is tonight  
We seem set for war, set for war  
We should take the time to calm down  
Take the time to get some fresh air, to get some fresh air  
To get some ai-ai-ai-air-air, ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-air  

Oh, these words that come back to me at these meetings  
Who will be the most petty? Who will be the most crazy?  
Oh, these veins that swell to spit out venom  
Yet we know it leads to nothing  

But who among us will take the first step?  
Sometimes, I fear for us when we’re this low  
When a little spark ignites everything, me myself above all  
We won’t let go, don’t let go, don’t let go  

There’s like a spark in the sky tonight  
I feel the earth tremble, the apocalypse is tonight  
We seem set for war, set for war  
We should take the time to calm down...  
There’s like a spark in the sky tonight  
I feel the earth tremble, the apocalypse is tonight  
We seem set for war, set for war  
We should take the time to calm down  
Take the time to get some fresh air, to get some fresh air  
To get some ai-ai-ai-air-air, ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-air  

We should take the time to calm down...  

There’s like a spark in the sky tonight  
I feel the earth tremble, the apocalypse is tonight  
We seem set for war, set for war  
We should take the time to calm down...  
There’s like a spark in the sky tonight  
I feel the earth tremble, the apocalypse is tonight  
We seem set for war, set for war  
We should take the time to calm down  
Take the time to get some fresh air.
