**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain]  
They made me a man, my pains and my struggles  
I dragged from hall to hall, ready to end up in Fresnes  
They introduced me to the street, brother, and I made her my queen  
They told me: "If you're clever, don't mess with your peace"  
They said: "Bro, chill out," and I pulled out the gun  
I don’t know, but when we chill out, the haters get mad  
Man, we come from far and dare to open your big mouth  
Yeah, let me introduce you to my Dirty Suburb Music, Capital of Crime  

[Couplet 1]  
Yeah, yeah Veni Vidi Vici  
I came, I banged, and I conquered  
I’d love to tell you that you’re not my bitch  
But those words sound false, oh oh oh  
Yeah, what’s new, Fouiny Babe? I’ve got the style, I’ve got the flow  
I’ll rub your back then I’ll break your back  
Oh, yeah, we drive without a license, Mercedes Benz, Fouiny R’n’B  
I need you so much: you’re my girl  
Yeah, black SUV with tinted windows  
If I sell my rims, I have enough to get you high (high)  
With "ifs," you can remake the world  
With uzis, we spray everyone  
We don’t sniff coke, we don’t eat pork  
My rap isn’t halal, of course, it’s not dead  
Yeah, so I walked into a club  
I took the time to leave Amsterdam and come back with a twelve  
See La Fouine Live Get tickets as low as $56 You might also like

They made me a man, my pains and my struggles

I don’t know, but when we chill out, the haters get mad  
Man, we come from far and dare to open your big mouth  
Yeah, let me introduce you to my Dirty Suburb Music, Capital of Crime  

[Couplet 2]  
Yeah, yeah  
Veni, vidi, vici  
I came, I fell, and I came back out  
Innocent, incarcerated, case closed without follow-up  
Never put off until tomorrow what you can blow up right now  
Yeah, my rap isn’t a disposable razor  
Dirty Suburb, send your crew if they’re good  
Swag on the cap, Louis on the vest  
Rap is like McDonald's, you have no choice, I’m the filet  
Yeah, it’s Dirty Suburb on the track  
My DJ’s car costs more than their artist’s promo  
Yeah, French rap is going crazy  
Capital of crime, thugs featuring accountants  
I’m so happy we scratched my ride, but no hard feelings  
I’m one of the few MCs who actually has one, haha!  
You tried, you leave disappointed  
In Trappes, when the cat’s away, the mice shoot each other!

[Couplet 3]  
Yeah, yeah  
Veni, vidi, vici  
I came in Gucci, in Louis  
You were supposed to drop in June, but now you’re coming out in autumn  
You listened to my record and pushed back your album  
Yeah, we’ll forget them all like Danny Glover  
For us, it’s Range Rover, for them, it’s game over  
Yeah, sold-out concert, don’t act dumb  
Man, we blocked the street while you were blocking the toilets  
Yeah, shotgun on the beat, Rise-E  
2000-2011, too many MCs have been shaved, shaved  
Shaving the walls is what you have left to do  
We’ll do like your father: we’ll give you a little brother  
Yeah, my white girl sells like Lady Gaga  
If I get busted, I’ll end up in the shadows like You
