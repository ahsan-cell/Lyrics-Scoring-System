**Translated Lyrics:**

You’re in my head  
You haunt my thoughts  
I won’t come out unscathed  
'Cause you have your boyfriend  
And it’s clear you care for him  
But girl, listen to this  
To say I don’t want to sway you  
Would be dishonest  
So much that you control my reactions  
Like a puppet on a string  
Why does it turn out this way?  
(Oh Woah)  
Let me be the one  
Who shares your life  
Yes, the one you confide in  
No one will understand you better than I do  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  
At worst, I’ll be the one who shares your night  
Spending a few hours with you in this bed  
I’ll know how to take care of you  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  

But you can’t even imagine what I feel for you  
Something crazy, I can’t even put it into words  
I never thought I’d get to this point  
No, the romantic type is really not me  
But I can’t help it  
I need to express it  
A sincere love in a world where sex reigns  
So I express myself  
My texts shine, my esteem girl  
You’ll be my Sylvia  
And I’ll be your Mesrine*  

Let me be the one  
Who shares your life  
Yes, the one you confide in  
No one will understand you better than I do  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  
At worst, I’ll be the one who shares your night  
Spending a few hours with you in this bed  
I’ll know how to take care of you  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  

With your exotic charm  
I melt like Kim  
Sensually ultimate  
Almost naughty  
Girlfriend  
Enjoying life is the doctrine  
Doctor, in my spare time according to the timing  
Doc Reyel, not Gynéco  
Dial problems  
Yeah, I’m not a pro  
I studied this at my school  
The one for Guadeloupeans from the great era  

Let me be the one  
Who shares your life  
Yes, the one you confide in  
No one will understand you better than I do  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  
At worst, I’ll be the one who shares your night  
Spending a few hours with you in this bed  
I’ll know how to take care of you  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  

I want to be the one who accompanies you  
For you to be my partner  
That we take pure trips together  
Don’t worry, it won’t be the countryside  
With low-key vibes in a sarong  
We’ll pop the champagne  
In Miami, Brazil, Morocco  
Or Spain  
The rest I’ll spare you  
Yeah, I’ll spare you  
Two or three kisses, a hug under the covers and BAM  
(Oou)  

I need to come back down to earth  
I don’t even have your number yet  
Let me be the one  
Who shares your life  
Yes, the one who defies your taboos  
No one will understand you better than I do  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  
At worst, I’ll be the one who shares your night  
Spending a few hours with you is enough for me  
I’ll know how to take care of you  
Give me my chance, you’ll see  

You’ll see, you’ll see  
I’ll be that one  
(Oh, no)  
I’m telling you, I’m telling you  
I’ll be that one  
You’ll see my girl  
And you’ll see my girl  
No, I’m telling you, I’m telling you  
I’ll be that one
