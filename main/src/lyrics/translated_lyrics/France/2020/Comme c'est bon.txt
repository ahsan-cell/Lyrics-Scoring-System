**Translated Lyrics:**

And taste again the salt resting on your lips, there  
Believe me or not, I’ll take you to see the sky again  
To sing you "In the Sun" (in the sun)  
Afraid of disappointing you  
You who are my mirror  
I’ll make myself pretty  
And I’ll light up the dark  
Just to see you better  
Thousands of candles  

If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to talk to you, to touch you  
If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to hold you, and kiss you  

After a few years away from you, if our hearts remember  
The warmth of being human, your hand resting right there  
Believe me or not, we could start all over  
Without looking back  

Afraid of disappointing you  
You who are my mirror  
I’ll make myself pretty  
And I’ll light up the dark  
Just to see you better  
Thousands of candles  

If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to talk to you, to touch you  
If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to hold you, and kiss you  

If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to talk to you, to touch you  
If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to hold you, and kiss you  

If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to talk to you, to touch you  
If you only knew how good it feels  
To be able to see you again  
To be able to hold you, and kiss you
