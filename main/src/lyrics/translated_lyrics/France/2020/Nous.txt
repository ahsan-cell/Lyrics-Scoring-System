**Translated Lyrics:**

We, we’ll go see the sea  
To see if people are proud  
Imagining the water rising  
Even though we don’t know how to do anything  
We have nothing left to lose  
A bit of belly and ego  
And a few tongues to untie  
To see them enjoy themselves again  

**[Chorus]**  
We, we, we  
We don’t care about you  
You can take it all  
As long as we’re tender, we  

We, we, we  
We don’t care about you  
You can take it all  
As long as we’re tender, we  

**[Verse 2]**  
We, we’ll go see the sea  
To see if the moon lights up  
A few heads above the water  
A world where everything is lost  
Tomorrow is just yesterday  
A little left on our backs  
A bit hurt by the stones  
That we didn’t want to lose  

**[Chorus]**  
We, we, we  
We don’t care about you  
You can take it all  
As long as we’re tender, we  

We, we, we  
We don’t care about you  
You can take it all  
As long as we’re tender, we  

**[Outro]**  
We, we, we  
(We!)  
We, we, we  
(We!)
