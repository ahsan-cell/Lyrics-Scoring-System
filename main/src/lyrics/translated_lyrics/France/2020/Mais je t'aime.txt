**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Camille Lellouche]**  
Don't tell me stories  
You know well, things aren't quite right  
With me, don't ask too much  
You know well, the cracks run deep  
Within me, don't hold on so tight  
If you doubt, don't hold on so tight  
If it costs you, don't let me go  
When I'm sure of myself  
I give you all I have, so try to see in me that  

**[Chorus: Camille Lellouche]**  
I love you  
But I love you  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
I love you, as strong as I can  
I love you, and I do my best  

**[Verse 2: Grand Corps Malade]**  
They told me: "Wait, you'll see, love is a great fire. It crackles, it lights up, it shines, it warms, it stings the eyes. It sends hundreds of fireflies up there, to the heavens. It ignites suddenly and lights up the world and life differently."  
We struck the match for the spark of our beginnings  
We fed this fire with all our excesses, our abuses  
We loved each other more than anything, alone in our bubble  
These flames drove us crazy, we forgot that in the end, fire burns

**[Chorus: Camille Lellouche & Ensemble]**  
But I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
But I love you, I love you  
I love you, as strong as I can  
I love you, and I do my best  

**[Verse 3: Grand Corps Malade]**  
I get close to our fire and I sweat with bitterness  
I see these yellow and blue flames dance, and the passion that consumes  
Why when love is strong does it make us vulnerable and fragile?  
I think of us and I waver, why has nothing been easy since?  
I love you in flames, I love you in gold  
I love you worried, I love you too strong  
I love you for two, I love you wrongly  
It's perilous, I still love you  
So it's true, it pierces me  
I love you heavy, I love you unsteady  
Of course, it devours me  
I know so well that I love you, badly  

**[Verse 4: Camille Lellouche]**  
If I move forward, with you  
It's because I see myself dancing in your arms  
I have no expectations  
You give me so much love, so much strength  
That I can no longer do without you  
If my words hurt you, it's not your fault  
My wounds are from yesterday  
There are days harder than others  
If my words weigh on you  
I'm not to blame  
I'm not to blame, nothing  

**[Chorus: Camille Lellouche & Ensemble]**  
But I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you  
I love you, I love you  
I love you, as strong as I can  
I love you, and I do my best / You love me, and you do your best  

**[Outro: Camille Lellouche & Ensemble]**  
But, I love you
