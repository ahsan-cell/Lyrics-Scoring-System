**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Despite the passing time, I hope  
Why do I win and then I lose?  
Like a child who’s told a story  
I must believe it  
Through the ups and downs, I know  
To give myself one last try  
I see life giving me a sign  
I’ve fought hard to be worthy of it  

[Chorus]  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
Left by a heart that's unsure  
Feels like there’s no shortcut  
The race is over, I’m regaining my mind  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
Left by a heart that's unsure  
Feels like there’s no shortcut  
The race is over, I’m regaining my mind (I’m regaining my mind)  

[Verse 2]  
When I’m sure, I make the effort, no matter who’s at fault  
We eventually come to an agreement  
Sometimes I go a bit too far, I’m wary of still waters  
And what if it was just fate?  
Despite the doubts, I hold on  
You know, I don’t feel the blows  
I get back up, I don’t tremble  
I live, I see, don’t worry about me  

[Chorus]  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
Left by a heart that's unsure  
Feels like there’s no shortcut  
The race is over, I’m regaining my mind  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
Left by a heart that's unsure  
Feels like there’s no shortcut  
The race is over, I’m regaining my mind (I’m regaining my mind)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  

[Bridge]  
Despite the doubts, I hold on  
You know, I don’t feel the blows  
I get back up, I don’t tremble  
I live, I see, don’t worry about me  

[Chorus]  
I believe that everything's fine so far (so far)  
Left by a heart that's unsure (oh oh)  
Feels like there’s no shortcut  
The race is over, I’m regaining my mind  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
Left by a heart that's unsure  
Feels like there’s no shortcut  
The race is over, I’m regaining my mind (I’m regaining my mind)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  
Follow me, follow me, oh, oh, oh  

[Outro]  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
I’m regaining my mind  
I believe that everything's fine so far  
I’m regaining my mind
