**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I knew you before hell  
I knew you when you were the king  
Long before the dark circles and shadows  
Of children of the night who do anything  
Remember when you made the girls laugh  
Remember how handsome and proud you were  
Before a needle came to visit  
See what it did to my brother  

[Chorus]  
At the end of the world  
On the edge of the void, I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me  
At the end of the world  
On the edge of the void, I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me  

[Verse 2]  
You can lie to the whole world  
But against me, you’re no match  
I’m not afraid of your secrets  
Of your wounds, of your scars  
Look at us in the photo  
When we toasted to friendship  
No tricks, no, nothing false  
Come, let’s go back to the past  

[Chorus]  
At the end of the world  
On the edge of the void, I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me  
At the end of the world  
On the edge of the void, I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me  
I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me  

[Bridge]  
And on your damaged skin  
I will erase your wounds, it’s my battle  
And I will walk by your side  
Wherever you are, wherever you go  

[Chorus]  
At the end of the world  
On the edge of the void, I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me  
At the end of the world  
On the edge of the void, I will reach out my arms to you  
And all my seconds  
I’ll give them to you if you need me
