**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Give me your heart, your hand, and the rest  
Give me what you are  
What you are  
Tell me your fears, sorrows, and the rest  
Tell me who you are  
Who you are  
I imagine a world, a heavenly world  
Where no one goes out, no  
Where no one stays  
I imagine a scream (I imagine a scream)  
Your cries in the night (Your cries in the night)  
I imagine so many things about you (About you)  
Maybe it's you that I am sometimes (Sometimes)  

[Verse 2]  
I imagine a nest of sad stories  
I imagine a bed, a complicit insomnia  
I imagine a me drowning in your vices  
Without faith or law, I slip through the meshes  
I imagine a man, a woman, a caregiver  
Who sees only a clone of me in my records  
A big racket in my novice soul  
I’ll come home late because I no longer see the risks  

[Chorus]  
Please, give me your heart  
Give me what you are (What you are, what you are)  
What you are (What you are)  
Tell me your fears  
Tell me who you are (Who you are, who you are)  
Who you are (Who you are)  

[Bridge]  
I want to see the world of another time  
The one the world doesn’t know  
I want to see the shadow of another you  
The one the world doesn’t know  
I want to see the world of another time  
The one the world doesn’t know  
I want to see in you all that I’m not  
Tell me who you love and above all  

[Chorus]  
Please, give me your heart  
Give me what you are (What you are, what you are)  
What you are  
Tell me your fears  
Tell me who you are (Who you are, who you are)  
Who you are (Who you are)  
Please, give me your heart  
Give me what you are  
What you are  
Tell me your fears  
Tell me who you are  
Who you are
