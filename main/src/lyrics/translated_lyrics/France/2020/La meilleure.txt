**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Hatik]  
I know you by heart, as if I've always known you  
You're my best friend, my soulmate, with you, I'm in the bonus  
Between us, it's physical, like the streets, you attract me like a magnet  
You're the most beautiful of all my songs, you're the brick and you're the cement  

[Chorus: Hatik]  
Come on, let’s escape, let’s see elsewhere, we’ll live another life, forget our sorrows  
Come on, let’s escape, let’s see elsewhere, we’ll live another life, forget our sorrows  
Come on, let’s escape  

[Verse 2: Jok'Air]  
Come on, let’s escape, come on, let’s run from here, too much jealousy from Juvisy to Vélizy  
Too much fantasy, their love is fake like a fugazi*  
Come on, let’s get away, once we’re far from all this, we’ll indulge  
Let’s not look back  

[Chorus: Hatik]  
Come on, let’s escape, let’s see elsewhere, we’ll live another life, forget our sorrows  
Come on, let’s escape, let’s see elsewhere, we’ll live another life, forget our sorrows  
Come on, let’s escape  
Come on, let’s escape  

[Bridge: Hatik]  
Love, love, love, you’re the best, best, best, best  
Love, love, love, you’re the best, best, best, best  

[Chorus: Hatik]  
Come on, let’s escape, let’s see elsewhere, we’ll live another life, forget our sorrows  
Come on, let’s escape, let’s see elsewhere, we’ll live another life, forget our sorrows  
Come on, let’s escape
