**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
They told me ready-made phrases  
So many things and their opposites  
But I didn’t listen  
They say to me: "Don’t just follow your own head"  
I won’t let myself be pushed around  
I don’t want to hear them  

[Pre-Chorus: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
I want to be heard  
I live the way it sings to me  

[Chorus: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
Hold back time if everything stops  
Make my head spin  
Alive down to my fingertips  
Hold on to summer when it halts  
My heart is in celebration  
Alive down to the end (to the end), to the tips of my fingers (to the end)  
To the tips of my fingers (to the end)  

[Verse 2: Imen Es, Amel Bent]  
I’ve understood the truth  
In life, we reap what we deserve  
Deep down, we all want to exist  
Young and impatient, I won’t hesitate  
Often life makes you reflect  
There are things you can’t avoid  
Too many ambitions to stop me  
Only for my girls can I give it all up  

[Pre-Chorus: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
I want to be heard  
I live the way it sings to me  

[Chorus: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
Hold back time if everything stops  
Make my head spin  
Alive down to my fingertips  
Hold on to summer when it halts  
My heart is in celebration  
Alive down to the end (to the end), to the tips of my fingers (to the end)  
To the tips of my fingers (to the end)  

[Bridge: Imen Es, Amel Bent]  
How to stand tall? You, tell me how to do it  
What’s the point of counting the blows, I never look back  
How to stand tall? You, tell me how to do it  
What’s the point of counting the blows, I never look back  

[Chorus: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
Hold back time if everything stops  
Make my head spin  
Alive down to my fingertips (to the tips of my fingers)  
Hold on to summer when it halts (when it halts)  
My heart is in celebration  
Alive down to the end (to the end), to the tips of my fingers  
Hold back time if everything stops (if everything stops)  
Make my head spin  
Alive down to my fingertips (to the tips of my fingers)  
Hold on to summer when it halts (when it halts)  
My heart is in celebration  
Alive down to the end (to the end), to the tips of my fingers (to the end)  
To the tips of my fingers (to the end)  

[Outro: Amel Bent, Imen Es]  
To the tips of my fingers  
To the end, to the tips of my fingers  
To the end
