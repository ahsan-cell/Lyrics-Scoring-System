**Translated Lyrics:**

There was no image, there was no color  
There was no story, my soulmate  
There were no parties, there was no heart  
No smiles at all, my soulmate  

[Pre-Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
You know, the world wasn’t turning right  
I had the words but not the song  
You know love, you know passion  
Yes, it’s written, it was said  
Yes, that’s life  

[Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Before you, I had nothing  
Before you, no one showed me the way  
I know, Heaven doesn’t hold it against me  
For laying my eyes on you  
Before you, no one showed me the way  

[Verse 2: Vitaa]  
There was no home, there was no happiness  
I had no reason, my soulmate  
There was no laughter, but there were no tears  
I was alone here, my soulmate  

[Pre-Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
You know, the world wasn’t turning right  
I had the words but not the song  
You know love in every way  
Yes, it’s written, it was said  
Yes, that’s life  

[Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Before you, I had nothing  
Before you, no one showed me the way  
I know, Heaven doesn’t hold it against me  
For laying my eyes on you  
Before you, no one showed me the way  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh  

[Bridge: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Before you, I had nothing  
Before you, no one showed me the way  

[Chorus: Vitaa & Slimane]  
Before you, I had nothing  
Before you, no one showed me the way  
I know, Heaven doesn’t hold it against me  
For laying my eyes on you  
Before you, no one showed me the way  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh  
Ooh ooh, ooh ooh
