**Translated Lyrics:**

Dreaming of us  
Telling you about life  
Like we were crazy  
I've sung, oh so many words  
But never for you  
It sounded wrong, yeah  
A little piece of me  

It's like a world without sky  
Love without her  
A man without passion  
It's emptiness at home  
It's like a beginning without an end  
Never taking a hand  
Giving it all  
Without ever gaining anything  

If you're not, not, not  
If you're not, not here  
If you're not, not, not  
If you're not here  

If you're not, not, not  
If you're not, not here  
If you're not, not, not  
If you're not here  

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
If you're not here  

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
If you're not here  

I want to wake up  
Knowing why  
Seeing that everything has changed  
Little one in my arms  
I want to cry with love  
And become fragile  
Tremble like a leaf  
And live on a thread  

It's like a world without sky  
Love without her  
A man without passion  
It's emptiness at home  
It's like a beginning without an end  
Never taking a hand  
Giving it all  
Without ever gaining anything  

If you're not, not, not  
If you're not, not here  
If you're not, not, not  
If you're not here  

If you're not, not, not  
If you're not, not here  
If you're not, not, not  
If you're not here  

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
If you're not here  

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
If you're not here  

To you  
Who doesn't hear me  
To you  
Who still isn't here  
To you  
Who makes my heart dance  
For you  
I'll never be afraid again  

If you're not, not, not  
If you're not, not here  
If you're not, not, not  
If you're not here  

If you're not, not, not  
If you're not, not here  
If you're not, not, not  
If you're not here  

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
If you're not here  

Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh-oh-oh  
If you're not here  

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh) If you're not here  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh) If you're not here  
(Oh-oh-oh) If you're not here  
If you're not here  

(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh) If you're not here  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh) If you're not here  
(Oh-oh-oh) If you're not here  
Not, not
