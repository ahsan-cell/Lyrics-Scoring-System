**Translated Lyrics:**

But the world has changed, it has shifted a few vertebrae  
But the world has changed, it has shifted a few vertebrae  

**[Verse 1]**  
I don’t want to write about the pains that femininity has caused me  
Tell Jacquie and Michel to come and get me  
I just want to be like everyone else, I just want to doubt a little  
I believe the Earth is round, but I prefer to conspire  
We can’t change the shadows, we can only illuminate them  
Until the sun falls, tired of warming us  
And in our desires for beaches, UV-A and UV-B  
I see some swimming towards what we’ve already sunk  
But if the times have fleas, it’s because they don’t have the right collar  
Beauty, you know, wears out, it’s like your first kiss  

**[Chorus]**  
But the world has changed, it has shifted a few vertebrae  
Where was the osteopath, hiding in his back waiting for the fever?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Hell isn’t other people, it’s those who make you dream  
And who sell their underwear for a bit of TV  
And all my big family has their hearts all mixed up  
As long as there are some shares and emptiness to drain  
They’ll go to the ice floe, spend a few summer months  
Photographing some beaches for a little money  

**[Chorus]** (x3)  
But the world has changed, it has shifted a few vertebrae  
Where was the osteopath, hiding in his back waiting for the fever?  

**[Outro]**  
But the world has changed, the world has changed  
But the world has changed, the world has changed
