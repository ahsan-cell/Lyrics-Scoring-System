**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's a cursed Monday morning  
What I'm doing doesn't please me  
I've decided by tomorrow  
It won't be me anymore  
Love has gone far away  
I've cried for centuries  
I've decided by tomorrow  
I will stop

[Pre-Chorus]  
I make life my flag  
I see life as a gift  
We don't have time to get bored  
We don't have time to feel small  
We don't have time to languish (oh, oh, oh)  
We don't have time but years  
We don't have time, no, but peace  
We don't have time to languish (oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]  
Let's not wait to live  
Let's not wait to live  

[Verse 2]  
The friend never came  
The friend who promised the moon  
Tomorrow, I'll reach for it without him  
Saturn  
The train never arrived  
The train that leads to paradise  
Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll find my own way  
Without him

[Pre-Chorus]  
I make life my flag  
I see life as a gift  
We don't have time to get bored  
We don't have time to feel small  
We don't have time to languish (oh, oh, oh)  
We don't have time but years  
We don't have time, no, but peace  
We don't have time to languish (oh, oh, oh)

[Chorus]  
Let's not wait to live  
Let's not wait to live  
Let's not wait, no, to live  
Let's not wait to live, no  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I make life my flag  
I see life as a gift  
We don't have time to get bored  
We don't have time to feel small  
We don't have time to languish  
We don't have time but years  
We don't have time, no, but peace  
We don't have time to languish  

[Chorus]  
Let's not wait (oh, oh, oh) to live  
Let's not wait (oh, oh, oh)  
Let's not (oh, oh, oh) wait to live  
Let's not wait, oh, oh, oh  
Let's not wait
