**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I never planned to adopt one day  
My child, I had to learn to adapt  
It’s not just genes that make a family  
Just humans who love each other is enough  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And if the downpour hits us, you and me  
We’ll get through it together, two or three  
And if the downpour hits us, you and me  
Take my hand as your stepdad  

[Chorus]  
I wasn’t expecting you  
I won’t let you go  
Even without the same blood, we’ll love each other  

[Verse 2]  
No, I will never take the place of the first one who said: "I love you"  
On your face, we see his face, and that’s how you are beautiful  
Between you and me, it’s me, I admit, who invited myself  
Into her life, there, into the life she never asked for  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And if the downpour hits us, you and me  
We’ll get through it together, two or three  
And if the downpour hits us, you and me  
Take my hand as your stepdad  

[Chorus]  
I wasn’t expecting you  
I won’t let you go  
Even without the same blood, we’ll love each other  
We’ll love each other  

[Verse 3]  
I never planned to adopt one day  
In naked truth, it’s you who made it happen  
It’s not just genes that make a family  
As long as we love each other  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And if the downpour hits us, you and me  
We’ll get through it together, two or three  
And if the downpour hits us, you and me  
Take my hand as your stepdad  

[Chorus]  
I wasn’t expecting you  
I won’t let you go  
Even without the same blood, we’ll love each other  
Even without the same blood, we’ll love each other
