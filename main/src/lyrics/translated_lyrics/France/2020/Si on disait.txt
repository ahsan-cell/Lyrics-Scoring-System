**Translated Lyrics:**

This morning, I have no words, it’s hard  
The answers to your questions, I don’t have them  
I’m also afraid of time, the time that slips away  
And the past doesn’t help us  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
So many nights we don’t talk  
We forget everything, we start again here  

**[Chorus]**  
What if we said we have the time  
That we still dream  
Not like the grown-ups  
What if we thought like children  
That we are stronger  
To really say it  
I’d do anything to keep you near  
If you fall, to support you  
I’ve seen the best and the worst  
I won’t play games  
What if we said we have the time  
To meet again without pretending  
Like before  

**[Verse 2]**  
Images blending in my head  
The clouds passing by, you don’t see them (you don’t see them)  
I see you at night, sitting by the window  
When I call you, you don’t answer (you don’t answer)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
So many nights we don’t talk  
We forget everything, we start again here  

**[Chorus]**  
What if we said we have the time  
That we still dream, not like the grown-ups  
What if we thought like children  
That we are stronger, to really say it  
I’d do anything to keep you near  
If you fall, to support you  
I’ve seen the best and the worst  
I won’t play games  
What if we said we have the time  
To meet again without pretending  
Like before  
Like before  

**[Outro]**  
This morning, I have no words, it’s hard  
The answers to your questions, I don’t have them
