**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I am like a story  
That will never end  
I archive the lost paradise  
Will it continue?  
And who made us believe  
That we wouldn't make it?  
I wouldn’t bet much on my skin  
I didn’t think much of myself  
Will you remember?  
Will you want?  
Like yesterday, letting it happen  
Under the moon and the horses  
I will be your chaos  
Oh oh oh oh  

[Chorus]  
To life, to believing  
To our celebrations  
Saving our skin, saving this name  
Only keeping the beautiful  
I am the girl, I am the boy  
These are our celebrations  

[Verse 2]  
I had left before  
All alone but losing  
The whole world against me  
Dreaming only of you  
So, I decided to see only the good  
There will certainly be someone  
To listen to me somewhere  
But they won’t succeed  
In degrading us  
I will love you still  
Still and until my death  
I will be your chaos, oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  

[Chorus]  
To life, to believing  
To our celebrations  
Saving our skin, saving this name  
Only keeping the beautiful  
I am the girl, I am the boy  
These are our celebrations  
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh  

[Outro]  
To life, to believing  
To our celebrations  
Saving our skin, saving this name  
Only keeping the beautiful  
I am the girl, I am the boy  
These are our celebrations  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh
