**[Verse 1]**  
In the closet, my feelings  
Especially not saying anything and pretending  
Being apart, a little off-balance  
At the end of the ship, I’m sinking slowly  
Mom, I’m sorry, I won’t lie to you  
It’s hard to erase everything that attracts me  
A bit overwhelmed by all my desires  
Dad, it’s true I’ve gone astray  
I’m a flower fighting between two stones  
I have a heart messed up by good manners  

**[Bridge]**  
Will we ever put an end  
To the hate and the insults?  
Will someone come to tell them  
That we love each other and it’s not impure?  
So I don’t think about ending it all  
Your blows have given me style  
For better or for worse  
I’ll take your hand one day, that’s for sure  

**[Chorus]**  
There’s no love censorship  
There’s only sincere love  
There’s no love censorship  
There’s only sincere love  

**[Verse 2]**  
Disguising who I really am  
Silencing the rumors  
Words are sharp  
Lying to tear out our teeth  
They’re looking for a doctor  
We suffer without being in pain  
Mom, I’m sorry, I took your pills  
It’s not that I wanted to leave, but it’s violent  
I just wanted to sleep a little longer  
Dad, don’t worry, I’ve learned to run  
I also want a family to feed  
I don’t care who I’ll fall asleep next to  

**[Bridge]**  
Will we ever put an end  
To the hate and the insults?  
Will someone come to tell them  
That we love each other and it’s not impure?  
So I don’t think about ending it all  
Your blows have given me style  
For better or for worse  
I’ll take your hand one day, that’s for sure  
Will we ever put an end  
To the hate and the insults?  
Will someone come to tell them  
That we love each other and it’s not impure?  
So I don’t think about ending it all  
Your blows have given me style  
For better or for worse  
I’ll take your hand one day, that’s for sure  

**[Chorus]**  
There’s no love censorship  
There’s only sincere love (children are for a man and a woman)  
There’s no love censorship (it’s absolutely not for homosexuals)  
There’s only sincere love (more and more gays on TV, so people are questioning themselves; it spreads, in fact, like a disease)  
(and then, with dogs, then with cats, monkeys, and what next?)  
(so let’s say it’s part of the evil because it doesn’t align with the love given by God between a man and a woman)
