**Translated Lyrics:**

Nothing has any flavor  
You shouldn’t have left, leaving me at my wit's end, baby  
There’s like a flaw, in my head it spins around  
And you don’t care  
That’s life, it’s goodbye, nothing stands upright anymore  

And just like that, you see, each day follows endlessly  
Is it really necessary for time to be like before?  
Oh, oh, oh  

Since you’ve been gone, I’m losing it, baby you shouldn’t have left  
Since you’ve been gone, I’m going crazy  
Since you’ve been gone, I count the days one by one  
They say that those who run away are followed  
Baby, you shouldn’t have left  
Since you’ve been gone, I’m going crazy  
Since you’ve been gone, I count the days one by one  

It’s nice outside, but outside it’s not yet  
That we feel better  
It would have been better to move, to move slowly, baby  
There’s like a spring, ringing loudly in my head  
And you don’t care  
It’s not worse, it’s not better, but somewhere in between  

And just like that, you see, each day finds its way  
Is it really necessary for time to be like before?  
Oh, oh, oh  

Since you’ve been gone, I’m losing it, baby you shouldn’t have left  
Since you’ve been gone, I’m going crazy  
Since you’ve been gone, I count the days one by one  
They say that those who run away are followed  
Baby, you shouldn’t have left  
Since you’ve been gone, I’m going crazy  
Since you’ve been gone, I count the days one by one  

And just like that, you see  
Each day continues on its path, oh, eh, eh  
And just like that, you see  
Each day continues on its path, oh, baby, eh  

And just like that, you see  
Each day continues on its path  
And just like that, you see  
Each day follows endlessly  
Is it really necessary for time to be like before?  
Oh, oh, oh  

Since you’ve been gone, I’m losing it, baby you shouldn’t have left  
Since you’ve been gone, I’m going crazy  
Since you’ve been gone, I count the days one by one  
They say that those who run away are followed  
Baby, you shouldn’t have left  
Since you’ve been gone, I’m going crazy  
Since you’ve been gone, I count the days one by one
