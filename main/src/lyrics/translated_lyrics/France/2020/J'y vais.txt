**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Patrick Fiori & Florent Pagny]  
If I must walk a whole lifetime  
To see my childhood in your eyes  
I will go  
If I must find my light again  
When the candle is worth the game  
I will go  
Like a first glance anew  
The beginning of my story  

[Chorus: Florent Pagny & Patrick Fiori]  
And in each of our steps  
We carry like a shadow  
From here to the ends of the earth  
No matter where time will take us  
He is there, he is the voice that sings to us  
Pretty ghost that haunts us  
That child who never leaves us  

[Bridge: Florent Pagny & ensemble]  
All my life comes from his  
All his life flows in my veins  

[Verse 2: Patrick Fiori & Florent Pagny]  
If I had to cross the seas  
To ignite the lands of fire  
I would go  
To reclaim my dreams of yesterday  
To give them a better world  
I will go  
When the past distances me  
I hear it laughing in silence  

[Chorus: ensemble]  
And in each of our steps  
We carry like a shadow  
From here to the ends of the earth  
No matter where time will take us  
He is there, he is the voice that sings to us  
Pretty ghost that haunts us  
That child who never leaves us  

[Outro: Florent Pagny, Patrick Fiori & ensemble]  
In the songs, the prayers  
All our secrets lost in time  
Oh, oh, I will go  
In these springs without winter  
In all the mirrors reflecting the past  
I will go  
Itâ€™s in each of our steps  
In each of our steps  
I will go  
In each of our steps  
In each of our steps  
I will go
