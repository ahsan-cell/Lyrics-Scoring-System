**Translated Lyrics:**

The air is deaf to our feelings  
The air is short, and my longing for you  
You, my other self  
You see, my soul is in the water  
If dreams have doors  
Let them lead me there, by your side  
The dark wave I had to cross  
To the pains, for no one knows  
My soul is in the water  

Blessed be my refuge  
Blessed be the gold of my home  
Sweet the breath, our hands that brush  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  

The air is heavy with your absence  
The air is deaf to my feelings  
The angel in heaven whispers, I love you  
In an ultimate essential  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  

The air is heavy with your absence  
The air is deaf to our feelings  
Love's air sometimes eludes us  
I see the dawn that drowns  
My soul is in the water  
But dreams have doors  
That lead me where I could stand  
Despair, the present sweeps me away  
Must I believe that I am dead?  
My soul is in the water  

Blessed be your presence  
Blessed be the gold of all worlds  
My soul is in the water  
My soul is in the water  

The air is heavy with your absence  
The air is deaf to our feelings  
The air is short, and my longing for you  
You, my other self  
You see, my soul is in the water
