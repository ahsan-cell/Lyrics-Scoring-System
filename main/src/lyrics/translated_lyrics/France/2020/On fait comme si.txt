**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s a strange silence coming from the street  
Like an unexpected Sunday  
A man sings over there, on a balcony  
His neighbor accompanies him on the violin  
We told the children reassuring words  
It felt like an adventure  
We stuck their drawing on the fridge  
We turned off the news channels  

**[Chorus]**  
We act as if it’s all just a game  
We act as if we’re doing what we can  
When night falls, closing our eyes  
We act as if this world were still happy  
We act as if we weren’t here  
Parents, friends, we’ll meet again  
And even if this spring fades away  
I swear, I promise, the world will start anew  

**[Verse 2]**  
Despite the fears, there are laughs that cling on  
Being so far brings us closer  
Even to talk about nothing, the blue of the sky  
Above all, give me some news  

**[Chorus]**  
We act as if it’s all just a game  
We act as if we’re doing what we can  
When night falls, closing our eyes  
We act as if this world were still happy  
We act as if we weren’t here  
Parents, friends, we’ll meet again  
And even if this spring fades away  
I swear, I promise, the world will start anew  

**[Outro]**  
It’s a strange silence coming from the street  
Just a Sunday and more  
Sure that our lives afterward will be more beautiful  
Above all, give me some news
