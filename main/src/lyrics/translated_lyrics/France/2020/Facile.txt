**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I let go, I take it easy  
I sing, I sing  
It's just my life in peril  
Nights, they haunt me  
When it sways from high to low  
With my eyes closed, I move forward  
All in ignorance, when I think about it  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You think I shine, that I lie  
Open your eyes wide  

[Chorus]  
But don’t look at me as if it’s easy  
You know well that I’m not so docile  
If you only knew how much it costs me  
Not to show you my doubts  
I call upon my wisdom, S.O.S  
But don’t look at me as if it’s easy  
You know well that I’m not so docile  
If you only knew how much it costs me  
Not to show you my doubts  
I call upon my wisdom, S.O.S  

[Verse 2]  
It’s okay, I’m fragile  
Almost defenseless  
Don’t think it’s futile  
This is where it all begins  
When inside it flutters  
When it stirs, when it pounds  
I slip away and I’m surprised  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You think I shine, that I lie  
Open your eyes wide  

[Chorus]  
But don’t look at me as if it’s easy  
You know well that I’m not so docile  
If you only knew how much it costs me  
Not to show you my doubts  
I call upon my wisdom, S.O.S  
But don’t look at me as if it’s easy  
You know well that I’m not so docile  
If you only knew how much it costs me  
Not to show you my doubts  
I call upon my wisdom, S.O.S  

[Bridge]  
You think I shine, that I lie  
Open your eyes wide  
Yes, you think I shine, that I lie  
Open your eyes wide  

[Chorus]  
But don’t look at me as if it’s easy  
You know well that I’m not so docile  
If you only knew how much it costs me  
Not to show you my doubts  
I call upon my wisdom, S.O.S  
But don’t look at me as if it’s easy  
You know well that I’m not so docile  
If you only knew how much it costs me  
Not to show you my doubts  
I call upon my wisdom, S.O.S  

[Outro]  
Don’t look at me  
If you only knew, if you only knew  
Don’t look at me  
If you only knew, if you only knew  
If you only knew
