**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Nicky Jam]  
That day I saw you and felt your energy  
Since then, I don’t want you far from me (Far from me)  
I know you don’t know about me (About me)  
And I can’t lie to you  
What they say on the street about me (About me)  

[Chorus: Nicky Jam & J Balvin]  
And I won’t deny it  
We’re clear on that (On that, on that)  
I won’t deny it (Haha, I can’t deny it)  
We’re clear on that (Haha, we’re clear, we’re clear)  

[Verse 1: J Balvin & Nicky Jam]  
Just let me hold you, baby  
Kisses on your neck to quench the thirst  
My hand on your waist to start it off  
We’re never going to slow down, mama (No)  
Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Dance  
Plakata, plakata  
The way she moves, non-stop, non-stop  
The desire to have you is now stronger  
I want to have you  

[Chorus: Nicky Jam & J Balvin]  
And I won’t deny it (Come over here)  
We’re clear on that  
I won’t deny it  
We’re clear on that  

[Verse 2: Nicky Jam]  
What I’ve seen from you, babe, isn’t normal (Normal)  
But don’t worry, I’m not normal (-normal)  
I know your friends probably don’t like me, eh  
But go and tell them piece by piece  
How we have sex and I take away your stress  
Let’s do it again  

[Chorus: Nicky Jam]  
And I won’t deny it (I’m going to deny, going to deny)  
We’re clear on that (On that, on that)  
I won’t deny it (To deny, deny)  
We’re clear on that (On that, on that)  

[Bridge: Nicky Jam & J Balvin]  
No!  
Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Dance  
Plakata, plakata  
The way she moves, non-stop, non-stop  
The desire to have you is now stronger  
I want to have you  
And I won’t deny it (Ah, ah)  

[Outro: Nicky Jam, J Balvin, Nicky Jam & J Balvin]  
N-I-C-K (Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-Dance, plakata, plakata)  
J Balvin, man (The way she moves, non-stop, non-stop)  
Nicky-Nicky-Nicky Jam (Hahaha)  
La Industria Inc  
J Balvin  
I won’t talk much  
Let the beat keep r-r-r-breaking  
Yeah! (Yeah)  
Wuh! (Wuh, wuh)
