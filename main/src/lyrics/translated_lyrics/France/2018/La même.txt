**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Maître Gims]  
My friends, hear the life I've had  
Where people waited for me, but I never showed  
If I confuse them, if I disturb  
It's because I'm a jumble, a mix-up  

[Bridge: Maître Gims]  
I'm too complicated, I'll never choose  
Just one side, don’t ask me  
Where I want to go, even monkeys mimic the wise  
And all these wise men built cages where they keep us confined  

[Chorus: Maître Gims & Vianney]  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  

[Verse 2: Vianney & Maître Gims]  
We take boxes, we put people in them that we never truly understand  
Like man is made of a thousand boxes, these boxes we take are never big enough  
I've walked a thousand paths and shaken ten thousand hands  
We can love Brel and Meugui, even love our enemies  

[Bridge: Maître Gims]  
I'm too complicated, I’ll never fit  
Into your little boxes, I live day by day  
So I always zigzag with these dark glasses  
I hear people wondering: "When will the mask fall?"  

[Chorus: Maître Gims & Vianney]  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  

[Bridge: Vianney & Maître Gims]  
You entered my life, oh my cherished freedom  
Life is about desires, desire before opinions  
You entered my life, oh my cherished freedom  
Life is about desires, desire before opinions  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  

[Chorus: Maître Gims & Vianney]  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
Eh, eh, aye, aye, aye, aye  
Aye, aye, aye  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same  
If I bother you, well, it’s the same
