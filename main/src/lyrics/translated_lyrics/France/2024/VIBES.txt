**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Bellek track  
Baby wants to ride in the car  
I don't really answer calls anymore  

[Verse 1]  
Now I'm stepping into her life, she didn't expect me to know her  
I'm in the game, making money for a while now, it had to start somewhere  
I write rhymes, didn’t even know I might end up like this  
But hey, I’m gone, no turning back, baby, I’ve already begun  
Already begun, yeah, I’ve already begun  
I’m embedding myself in your mind as if we’ve known each other for years  
I might hurt you, but I don’t want to leave you behind  
We got along well, but I chose to break my ties  

[Chorus]  
She wants CDG, Balenciaga on her body  
I can’t tell her what I feel, my heart's too heavy  
I know I make you doubt, I’m knee-deep in the mess  
You knew my life but didn’t imagine this  
You thought it was us, but I was only working for me  
A little love, I didn’t just want to be your band-aid  
She wants CDG, Balenciaga on her body  
I can’t tell her what I feel, my heart's too heavy  

[Verse 2]  
Fatigue hits, I don’t understand my feelings anymore  
4MATIC, I’m ready for long distances  
I’m in the mix, baby, I understand everything that’s happening  
And in their minds, I already know what they think  
I want my sounds, my vibe to spread everywhere  
I could have given what I didn’t have for you  
Babe, you know I had plans for us  
But my tickets didn’t want us to meet, hey  
Baby wants to ride in the car, I get it, which one do you want?  
I’m in the passenger seat, got too many ideas in my head  
I don’t really answer calls anymore, slept too much, need to wake up  
She wants to know my business, doesn’t know if I just want to hook up  

[Chorus]  
She wants CDG, Balenciaga on her body  
I can’t tell her what I feel, my heart's too heavy  
I know I make you doubt, I’m knee-deep in the mess  
You knew my life but didn’t imagine this  
You thought it was us, but I was only working for me  
A little love, I didn’t just want to be your band-aid  
She wants CDG, Balenciaga on her body  
I can’t tell her what I feel, my heart's too heavy  

[Outro]  
She wants CDG, Balenciaga on her body  
I can’t tell her what I feel, my heart's too heavy  
I know I make you doubt, I’m knee-deep in the mess  
You knew my life but didn’t imagine this
