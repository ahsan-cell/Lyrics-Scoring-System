**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Zola & Koba LaD]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
It's the B.A, the BMF  
SHK  
Money, drugs, euros  
Ouh, ouh, ouh  
Narcos  
Ouh, ouh, ouh, ouh  

[Verse 1: Koba LaD]  
Only bad vibes, bad ideas (It's annoying), I no longer trust with my eyes closed (It's not even worth it)  
So send back the papers, I'm going to check (Ouh), send back the papers, I'm going to check (You resend them to my email)  
When I see her face, I have the demon, Iâ€™ll drag her but I have to wait for my stacks (A bill)  
I'm still waiting for judgment (Oh damn), so I can't afford to fall back for nothing (Oh damn)  
It stinks of weed on your landing (Gotta dose it), it's a "Goodbye" but I said: "See you later" (Forever)  
I'm almost sure I won't hit it again (The bimbo) and the gold Rollie, it doesn't tell the time (It's not even set)  
Zola, roll a joint of weed, do P2 (P2), I take two or three hits quickly on the blunt (Blunt)  
She asks why I drive with the seat low (The whore), baby, I'm just too laid-back on the road  

[Chorus: Zola & Koba LaD]  
I saw them leave (I saw them go) but never return (Never come back)  
In my binks, the stairs (In the bendo), it's not the right emergency exit (Right emergency exit)  
On the Rolex in ro'-ro' (Rolex in ro'-ro'), it's the countdown (The countdown)  
She's never on time (She's never on time), I forget she's made for (I forget she's made for)  
She likes to call me: "Big Daddy" (Yeah), LOL, my nephew plays the tough guy (Yeah)  
He tells me what he wants to be when he grows up, he wants a ten-dollar bill, he wants to sell the OG  
So, I pull out a bill for that little brat (That little brat), so, I pull out a bill for that little brat (That brat)  
So, I pull out a bill for that little brat (That little brat), so, I pull out a bill for that little brat  

[Verse 2: Zola]  
Because of people like me, the cops think their instincts don't lie (I'm burned)  
I can't stay in the hood, my girl wonders why I don't call (Hello?)  
I don't feel this plan (Nah), but I'm going anyway, I don't care (Don't give a damn)  
I lean back the seat in the car, while my baby takes off her stockings (Nasty)  
The bimbo, she wants a caramel daddy and a chocolate daddy (Aye, aye, aye, nasty)  
I found the keys to a Fe'-Fe' in my Lambo', it belonged to Koba LaD (Aye, aye, aye, I got you)  
A Glock on me, I'm going to stroll, in my garden, I want a pond where I can't touch the bottom (Aye, aye, aye)  
One, two, three, four, five shovels where I bury my stash (Aye, aye, aye)  
Knock, knock, knock, knock at my door, the cops on the landing, a Glock on me when I go for a stroll (I got you)  

[Bridge: Zola & Koba LaD]  
Yeah, you want my cash, my love but not my life (Aye, aye, aye)  
I've done dirty work, gotta put my crowbar on the gates of paradise (Aye, aye, aye)  
I admit, I've done too much dirt (Yeah, yeah, yeah), I've done too much dirt (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Stop fantasizing about her, I've already hit it, it's broken, it's trash  

[Chorus: Zola & Koba LaD]  
I saw them leave (I saw them go) but never return (Never come back)  
In my binks, the stairs (In the bendo), it's not the right emergency exit (Right emergency exit)  
On the Rolex in ro'-ro' (Rolex in ro'-ro'), it's the countdown (The countdown)  
She's never on time (She's never on time), I forget she's made for (I forget she's made for)  
She likes to call me: "Big Daddy" (Yeah), LOL, my nephew plays the tough guy (Yeah)  
He tells me what he wants
