Hailing from the Ursynów district of Warsaw, Włodkowski became fascinated with hip-hop in the mid-90s. "I went to the same elementary school as Vienio. We founded Mistic Molesta together, and then Kaczy joined us, and with the help of his cousin, we made our first beats on an Atari," recalls the rapper. The results came quite quickly, as by 1997, both Mistic Molesta's track "Osiedlowe akcje" and Włodi's solo recording "Nie dla sławy i nie dla pieniędzy" appeared on the iconic compilation "Smak B.E.A.T. Records." Both tracks encapsulate the essence of the artist's style at the time, where he described daily poverty, emphasized his attachment to Warsaw and Ursynów, and expressed an artistic manifesto, placing art above aspirations for fame, popularity, and money. At that time, no one imagined that through home-recorded hip-hop, one could break through and achieve success. "I never saw music as a chance to go far. I didn't think of it as a trampoline to success; it was just pure teenage passion, and that was it," Włodkowski confirms. However, it turned out that this passion could yield something more. Over the next three years, Molesta released three albums that sold very well and made the group one of the most important youth bands in Poland. Particularly, their debut album "Skandal" from 1998 brought the rappers not only a nomination for a Fryderyk award but also immense respect. It was a very tumultuous, emotional period in Włodi's life, which ultimately led to a mental transformation. From a cheeky, aggressive person, he became a responsible husband and father, and he also converted to Islam. Echoes of these transformations could be found in the rapper's debut solo material titled "...Jak nowonarodzony" (…Like a Newborn) from 2003. The immense anticipation for this longplay was evident in the popularity of the title single and the album reaching sixth place on the list of best-selling Polish albums. Włodi decided to pursue solo material as the first member of Molesta, but this had nothing to do with internal conflicts within the group. "I never felt restricted by the band. We are individualists who like to work together, but we also enjoy doing solo projects; there’s no problem with that," emphasizes Włodi. The rapper confirmed his potential with his second solo release "W..." (2005). The album featured unexpected guest appearances from esteemed young rappers Eisa and Tego Typ Mesa. They often mentioned later that it was a great opportunity for them to confront styles and experiences with a pioneer of the hip-hop scene, while for Włodi, it was a chance to refresh his perspective on rap. Both fans and journalists, as well as other artists, received "W..." very positively.

Another successful step in Włodi's career was the return to collaboration with Vienio, Pelson, and Wilk within Molesta. Two albums released in this lineup ("Nigdy nie mów nigdy" - Never Say Never from 2006 and "Molesta i kumple" - Molesta and Friends released two years later) went gold and reminded younger audiences of the group, who had already forgotten about the pioneers of the Warsaw rap scene. In 2009, Włodi, Eldo, and Pelson founded the anti-establishment project Parias. Initially, the group gained notoriety for a loud, albeit short-lived conflict with Peja, which resulted in the track "Hip-hop vs Peja" from Parias and two responses from the representative of the Poznań scene. Finally, in the spring of 2011, the trio's self-titled album was released, quickly climbing to third place on the OLiS chart, but it received moderately positive reviews from the press and fans. In 2013, Włodi signed with Step Records, under which his third solo album "Wszystko z dymem" (Everything with Smoke) was set to be released. The album was announced with the single "T&T," produced by Evidence, a respected figure among independent hip-hop fans and a member of the group Dilated Peoples. The longplay's premiere was planned for spring 2014. With a discography totaling nearly ten releases, Włodi is one of the most active figures in the hip-hop scene. The rapper has also made numerous guest appearances on other artists' albums, including WWO, Peja, Wzgórze Ya-Pa 3, Pono, Hemp Gru, Zipera, Pjus, Grammatik, and 2cztery7. Włodkowski enjoys immense respect among both veterans of the scene
