**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Tag]  
Young Bouba's got the sauce

[Pre-Chorus: Gims]  
Fake friendships (Fake friendships), yeah, it drives me loco loco  
All this wasted time, yeah, it drives me loco loco  
All of this for nothing (For nothing), yeah, it drives me loco loco  
All of this for nothing (For nothing), yeah, it drives me loco loco (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: Together]  
My darling drives me loco, baby drives me loco  
My darling drives me loco oh oh loco  
My darling drives me loco, baby drives me loco  
My darling drives me loco loco

[Verse 1: Lossa]  
Loco, the most beautiful in the picture (Oh, oh, in the picture)  
The jealous ones by my side, tell me "let's go" if you follow me (Go ahead, tell me)  
Oh oh Môkô, right now I feel something  
Traveling on the coast, baby I'll pay the price if needed  
Ah if needed, for you  
You'll have Chanel Coco, eh  
Diamond in five months, it's done  
You'll have the same on your finger

[Pre-Chorus: Gims & Lossa]  
Fake friendships (Fake friendships), yeah, it drives me loco loco  
All this wasted time, yeah, it drives me loco loco  
All of this for nothing (For nothing), yeah, it drives me loco loco  
All of this for nothing (For nothing), yeah, it drives me loco loco (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: Together]  
My darling drives me loco (Loco), baby drives me loco (Baby drives me loco)  
My darling drives me loco (Loco, oh, oh, oh), loco (Loco)  
My darling drives me loco (Drives me loco), baby drives me loco (Drives me loco)  
My darling drives me loco (Loco, loco)

[Verse 2: Gims & Lossa]  
I arrive like a firecracker with an unusual view  
I'm in a building across from Bill Gates with Masonic logos  
We’re chaining sleepless nights, I reach supersonic speed  
Ten points on the contract, concerts in Qatar, follow me if you’re strong enough  
Put in some gasolina (Gasoline), some gasolina (Gasoline)  
Live or survive, here it’s Warsaw (Ah, ah)

[Pre-Chorus: Gims & Lossa]  
Fake friendships (Fake friendships), yeah, it drives me loco, loco  
All this wasted time, yeah, it drives me loco, loco  
All of this for nothing (For nothing), yeah, it drives me loco, loco  
All of this for nothing (For nothing), yeah, it drives me loco, loco (Oh, oh)

[Chorus: Together]  
My darling drives me loco (Loco), baby drives me loco (Baby drives me loco)  
My darling drives me loco (Loco, oh, oh, oh), loco (Loco)  
My darling drives me loco (Drives me loco), baby drives me loco (Drives me loco)  
My darling drives me loco (Loco, loco)

[Outro: Gims]  
I have visions in the night, I have visions in the night  
I see midnight demons, oh, midnight demons (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
