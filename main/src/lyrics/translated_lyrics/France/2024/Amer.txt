**Translated Lyrics:**

I saw you, you caught my eye from the very first glance

I remember we’d hang out late at night

Barely parting ways, we already wanted to meet again

We swept our problems under the rug

We laughed all night long

In your pool or at the park

I let you believe you were the love of my life

But you wanted more than that

You expected more from me

But I wasn’t ready for that

It was too serious for me

But you wanted more than that

You expected more from me

But I wasn’t ready for that

It was too serious for me

I wanted to play with you, in the end, I lost you

I had your heart in my hands

You know I did the best I could

Another story we’ll never live

Another story we’ll never live

I let time separate us

Now there’s nothing left to fix

Sometimes I dreamed of seeing you return

I never did anything to keep you here

I’ll never be the one to make you smile

You and I are just a memory now

I think I ruined everything

Your heart in my hands, I think I let it go

Sometimes I showed cowardice

Thinking of you leaves me with a taste of unfinished business

I think of the past, I sleep poorly

I see myself waiting for you at your gate

On my regrets, I could write too many lines

First love, I shed too many tears

I wanted to play with you, in the end, I lost you

I had your heart in my hands

You know I did the best I could

Another story we’ll never live

Another story we’ll never live

I let time separate us

Now there’s nothing left to fix
