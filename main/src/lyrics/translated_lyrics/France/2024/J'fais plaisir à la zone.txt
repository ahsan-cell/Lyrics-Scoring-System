**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: SDM]  
You may know how to box, but we’ll take you down, your dead ones  
Boumi'  
You know, I don't like to do that!

[Verse 1: SDM]  
You're from Marseille like SD', I'm from the '92 like Jul, doomed to stay, money makes me go around  
It's not talent that pays, man, it's a whole package, I count fifty blue bills before I even step in  
When you talk to us, weigh your words, you may know how to box, but we’ll take you down, your dead ones  
Golden ball of the people, I'm like Benzema, tinted visor, gloved up on the T-MAX (Ah-ah)  
You taste the sole, you've left some holes, I count all week, living like Verratti  
They wait for my fall, they insulted me as a failure, we end up in a G-Class, fully loaded Maserati  
I'm in the city, in a little spot with the girls next door, all cute like Kanté but watch out if I'm on your side  
Eh, eh, I'm on a yacht, on the coast, there's too much latency on the coast, she loves it when I take the lead on the tip

[Chorus: Jul & SDM]  
I work all year (I work all year), I please the neighborhood (the neighborhood)  
Too many condemned (too many condemned), there are too many people who complain  
I work all year (I work all year), I please the neighborhood (the neighborhood)  
Too many condemned (too many condemned), there are too many people who complain  
I work all year (I work all year), I please the neighborhood (the neighborhood)  
Too many condemned, there are too many people who complain  
I work all year, I please the neighborhood  
Too many condemned, there are too many people who complain  

[Verse 2: Jul]  
I put on the hood so they don’t burn me on the T-MAX  
The kids are hungry, don’t show off too much with the Rolex  
We don’t forget those who haven’t forgotten you when you’re at your peak  
I don’t pay attention to traitors anymore, a bit like my ex  
Step out in the hood, and it clears out  
I break the count at the register and it lights up  
Selling the S1000 all week  
Some don’t look like much, but they have arsenals  
In the Audi with my OGs, free like Joe Pesci  
Don’t act crazy when you want a shout-out, ambitious since I was little  
Chameleon, I can switch from Stunt to Ferrari  
I get hurt, I come back strong like Amine Harit  
Electric like a Tesla  
Class C, plated 13, [?] the derbies and the cross  
RS6, Russian weapon, all masked up like a Corsican [?]  
We follow no one, we don’t mix, you break, you know the saying  
In front of the block, no halftime, pull out the guitar, I scare the residents  

[Chorus: Jul & SDM]  
I work all year (I work all year), I please the neighborhood (the neighborhood)  
Too many condemned (too many condemned), there are too many people who complain  
I work all year (I work all year), I please the neighborhood (the neighborhood)  
Too many condemned (too many condemned), there are too many people who complain  
I work all year (I work all year), I please the neighborhood (the neighborhood)  
Too many condemned, there are too many people who complain  
I work all year, I please the neighborhood  
Too many condemned, there are too many people who complain
