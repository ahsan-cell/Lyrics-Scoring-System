**Translated Lyrics:**

Baby, baby saw me passing in the Benz

[Chorus: Digba]  
I roll in a Merc Benz, Merc ew 500 gang (yeah)  
500, 500 bang, big theme, big theme, the crew just entered the room  
I roll in a Merc (Merc), Merc Benz (yeah)  
I roll in a Merc, yeah, I roll in a Merc Benz  

[Verse 1: MNKS]  
We’ve gotten used to walking with gloves on  
Drugs move quickly through the city (baw)  
If tomorrow works out, I’ll never boast (kakabaw)  
And don’t forget where we came from to end up here (eh)  
Still the same, I’m sitting on the chair (sku)  
I don’t like repeating things 25 times (sku)  
We’d come back from parties, stealing cars S  
Now it’s the driver who drops us off (nioon)  
Baby, get in the ride, we’re going for a spin (nioon)  
Driving around Paris to sell all the powder (nioon)  
So many years spent in the game, we’ve bled in the oven  
We all want a peaceful life at the end of the road  
The cops are circling around the building  
They’re too hungry, they want to bust the weed  
The young ones all enter the building  
To smoke their stuff, 20 bucks for weed, for hash  

[Pre-Chorus: Digba]  
Baby, baby saw me passing in the Benz  

[Chorus: Digba]  
I roll in a Merc Benz, Merc ew 500 gang (yeah)  
500, 500 bang, big theme, big theme, the crew just entered the room  
I roll in a Merc (Merc), Merc Benz (yeah)  
I roll in a Merc, yeah, I roll in a Merc Benz  

[Verse 2: Digba]  
Eh, eh, what are you talking about? (brrr)  
We’ve got the cash, the big deals  
What are you talking about? (cru)  
The sellers from my place sell more than yours  
What are you talking about?  
Tell them we’re kings, or that we will be kings  
In any case (gang freeze)  
Tell them (tell them), tell them we’re the dealers  
Tell them that in the morning at eleven o'clock (eleven o'clock)  
It’s us placing the workers (workers)  
You gotta work to be able to eat  
To fill your pockets  
Never empty them (shee-sheesh)  
Avoid all the losses you can  

[Pre-Chorus: Digba]  
Baby, baby saw me passing in the Benz  

[Chorus: Digba]  
I roll in a Merc Benz, Merc ew 500 gang (yeah)  
500, 500 bang, big theme, big theme, the crew just entered the room  
I roll in a Merc (Merc), Merc Benz (yeah)  
I roll in a Merc, yeah, I roll in a Merc Benz
