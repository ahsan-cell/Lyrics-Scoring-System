**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Dystinct]  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  
Maximum Beats  

[Refrain: Gims & Dystinct]  
Okay, eh, eh, baby, I admit I'm excessive  
For short trips, I take out the Fé'Fé'  
I prefer this over the Audi TT, so Spider for this summer  
I'm always stuck at Cartier  
Kelly bag to shock them  
Tonight, you're my trophy (Eh, eh, eh, eh)  
Ah, you're my life  
Ah, my love, ah  
I've only seen you, oh my darling  
Let's go  

[Post-refrain: Dystinct]  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, eh, eh)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé  

[Verse 1: Gims]  
Full concert in Düsseldorf  
Pumped up like Usain Bolt  
I'm in the ride, crossing eras  
Shopping on a day off  
The jet lands in Lausanne (Lausanne)  
And I'm dressed like Muzan (Muzan)  
With dark glasses when I see them (Ah)  
And mysterious like Oda (One Piece)  

[Refrain: Gims & Dystinct]  
Okay, eh, eh, baby, I admit I'm excessive  
For short trips, I take out the Fé'Fé'  
I prefer this over the Audi TT, so Spider for this summer  
I'm always stuck at Cartier  
Kelly bag to shock them  
Tonight, you're my trophy (Eh, eh, eh, eh)  
Ah, you're my life  
Ah, my love, ah  
I've only seen you, oh my darling  
Let's go  

[Post-refrain: Dystinct]  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, eh, eh)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé  

[Verse 2: Dystinct]  
Atay ne3ne3, Marrakech (Marrakech)  
Now mama's settled with a Rolex (Rolex)  
Relaxed, I'm in business class (Mmh)  
Showcase in Dubai, Bottega bag full of cash  
They're shocked, millions of dollars  
It doesn't shock me, I'm from the neighborhood  
We forgot everything, all in memory  
I drop thousands at LV Paris  
Oh my heart, oh my heart  
There's love and there's money  
Oh my heart, oh my heart  
Welcome to my world  

[Refrain: Gims & Dystinct]  
Okay, eh, eh, baby, I admit I'm excessive  
For short trips, I take out the Fé'Fé'  
I prefer this over the Audi TT, so Spider for this summer  
I'm always stuck at Cartier  
Kelly bag to shock them  
Tonight, you're my trophy (Eh, eh, eh, eh)  
Ah, you're my life  
Ah, my love, ah  
I've only seen you, oh my darling  
Let's go  

[Post-refrain: Dystinct & Gims]  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, eh, eh)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé (Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé)  
Ah, lé, lé, lé, lé, lé  
Excess of love, I think I'm going to pass my turn  
We have everything to gain, but it depends on us  
I left the towers, but my heart is in the oven  
My feelings in a sequential box  
Oh, oh, don’t invite her to the neighborhood, she’ll shake up the routine (Yeah)  
Shake up the routine, shake up the routine  
Oh, oh, don’t invite her to the neighborhood, she’ll shake up the routine (Yeah)  
Shake up the routine, oh, oh, shake up the routine (Mmh-mmh)
