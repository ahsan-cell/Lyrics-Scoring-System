**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: La Fève & Roje]  
Darling, we were meant to be  
Goodbye, my love  
Baby, bluebirds flying free (Eh, yeah)  
I just wanted to conquer the game, I just wanted to conquer the game (Oh, so high above)  
I just wanted to conquer the game, I just wanted to conquer the game (But you flew south in the spring)  
I just wanted to conquer the game, I just wanted to conquer the game (So I'll save my love for the one)  
Yes, 7, Walone, let's go  

[Verse 1]  
Tonight, my mind is clear, I call my brother  
You know, I wanted to conquer the game and I can't do it without my crew  
I'm up there, I've kept my momentum, tell me who can stop me?  
I've given too much, my friend, you know me, if you're my blood, I want you at the top, yeah (Yeah)  
Let's be honest, what's the point of being your friend?  
I can make the effort, but God knows, every time I do, it only brings me pain  
Darling, I have only my circle, they're there even in defeat  
Darling, I have only my circle, they're there even in defeat, yes  
I had to carve my path, break my routine, take the risks  
And my sadness, I confess, I thought about it since I left the Ritz  
You pull me down, I quickly realized it wasn't the same target we aimed for  
I had love for them, but they had no ambition, no missions  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Too loyal, I blind myself, yeah  
You know, I'd like to believe you  
But I've known too many setbacks, I'm not done seeing them  
Why trust you? It's too much suffering and too often, I lose  
Forgive me if I prefer to stay solitary  

[Chorus]  
All my life, I've given to others  
All my life, I've given to others, it's my weakness  
All my life, I've given to others  
All my life, I've given to others, it's my weakness  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time)  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time for yourself)  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time for yourself)  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time for yourself)  

[Verse 2]  
Fev 7, Walone, let's go, less  
The city is ghostly, there's not a soul on the street, I hear every step  
I tell myself we need to leave and I retrace my steps every time  
I'm full of sweat every night, I'm unlucky and I blame him  
Thank goodness we're blessed, I had to build my nest, chase the money  
It's worn me out, too many fake friends, they need to be eradicated  
No, cutting ties, I can't hesitate  
I know it's my jewel that attracted him  
So don't act crazy if you're not going to shoot  
I've grown up, best friends don't exist anymore  
The kids no longer know respect  
Before, no one dared to test me  
I just wanted to motivate my circle, inspire the nephews, the nieces  
I stopped hanging around, now I'm on the grind and you think I'm joking  
The stories the old-timer tells look like a movie, but this stuff is real  
I rubbed my eyes, they really boosted my streams, it wasn't a dream  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Too loyal, I blind myself, yeah  
You know, I'd like to believe you  
But I've known too many setbacks, I'm not done seeing them  
Why trust you? It's too much suffering and too often, I lose  
Forgive me if I prefer to stay solitary  

[Chorus: La Fève & Tiakola]  
All my life, I've given to others  
All my life, I've given to others, it's my weakness  
All my life, I've given to others  
All my life, I've given to others, it's my weakness  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time)  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time)  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time)  
All my life, I've given to others  
(You need to take your time, you need to take your time for yourself)
