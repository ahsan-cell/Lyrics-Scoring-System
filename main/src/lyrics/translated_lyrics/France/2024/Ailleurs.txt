**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Wow  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Wow  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere (Yeah)  
Yeah, wow  
Yeah, yeah  
Wow  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere (Elsewhere), mom wants to know what's wrong  
A lot of questions and debates, but hey, we all have our ups and downs  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere (Elsewhere)  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  

[Chorus]  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere (Elsewhere), mom wants to know what's wrong  
A lot of questions and debates, but hey, we all have our ups and downs  

[Verse 1]  
I don't know, I hate the cops and the state, I'm like the lookout, I shout it from the rooftops (Arah)  
I've got both middle fingers up, I feel a bit cramped when I give them the finger  
I liked the girl and her friend, come on, let’s do it all three together  
I'm taking some well-deserved rest, sauna, jacuzzi, Swedish massage  
I've made good and bad choices, but I've always stayed true  
I didn't grow up in velvet or silk, so I dreamed of the throne, I had to sit on it at least once  
It goes without saying, we've done some dirty work, we need to clean ourselves up (We need to clean ourselves up)  
How many times have I wrecked my voice, my lungs, and my liver?  
I'm tearing away to L.A., up high, the pool overflows onto the buildings  
I looked up at the stars because Earth has lost its charm (Nah)  
I've sinned a lot easily, I repent, I’m wary of punishment (Oh really?)  
With me, it's all or nothing, zero or a hundred percent, I don’t like "Almost"  

[Chorus]  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere (Elsewhere), mom wants to know what's wrong  
A lot of questions and debates, but hey, we all have our ups and downs (Downs)  
The future doesn't look bright (Oh, no), the future doesn't look bright (Oh no)  
Eyes towards the skies, I leave it to God, I try to do my best  

[Verse 2]  
Oh yeah, he wants to make trouble, he wants to size me up, brother (Size me up, brother)  
One way or another, I'll come back to face you, we’ll clash (We’ll clash)  
I just left Louis Vuitton, the little voice in my head says, "It's a bit pricey"  
The second one says, "We've come a long way, I'm not ashamed of it"  
I haven't always been honest (Never) but I’ve always been straightforward (Oh really?)  
Since the days of little schoolboys, since the days of little schoolboys  
Since the days of little schoolboys, I want oil money, bosses, and big shots  
But to get there, a lot of equations and points to connect  
I smoke that good stuff, it’s my thing, check out my sweater, it’s Prada  
I already know they’ll do nothing (Nothing), I already know they’ll do nothing (Nothing)  
I don’t know who will let me down, I also don’t know who will stop me  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere, it worries the one who nursed me  

[Chorus]  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere (Elsewhere), mom wants to know what's wrong  
A lot of questions and debates, but hey, we all have our ups and downs (All)  
The future doesn't look bright (Oh, no), the future doesn't look bright (Oh no)  
Eyes towards the skies, I leave it to God, I try to do my best (Yeah, wow, wow, wow)  

[Outro]  
Yeah  
Right now, I'm a bit elsewhere  
Yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
