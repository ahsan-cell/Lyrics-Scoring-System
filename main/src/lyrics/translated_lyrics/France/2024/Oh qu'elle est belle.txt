[Intro]  
Unleaded

[Refrain: JuL & DYSTINCT]  
Your heart, I’ve taken it  
Baby, I’m your guy  
From Marrakech to Marseille, baby, it’s JuL and Dystinct, oh my  
If needed, for you, I’d leave everything  
In my heart, I felt the sting  
Long hair, eyes like hazelnuts  
We’re in GS in Marrakech  
Oh, how beautiful she is, oh, how beautiful  
Oh, how beautiful she is, oh, how beautiful  
Oh, how beautiful she is, beautiful, beautiful  
Oh, how beautiful she is, oh, beautiful, beautiful  
She’s stunning, stunning, she’s magnificent  
The most beautiful of women, she’s my lovely  
She’s stunning, stunning, she’s magnificent  
The most beautiful of women, she’s my lovely  

[Verse 1: DYSTINCT]  
Local vibes, Tropicana juice, chillin’ in a Panamera  
My eyes are on fire, without you, what am I worth?  
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow  
Oh beauty, I’m losing my mind sometimes  
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow  
Make some tea, and let’s live the vida  
See JuL Live

[Verse 2: JuL]  
I’m on vacation with my lovely  
Far from everyone, I rented a boat and a car  
I’m on vacation with my lovely  
Far from everyone, I rented a boat and a car  
I love you, mama, mamacita, she’s waiting for my heart too  
I’m careful, mama, things move fast, health and sickness  
I’ve wasted my time, in the chaos, the emotions of life  
I want to break free, but I hesitate, sometimes we love well, sometimes we avoid  
Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah, pah-pah-pah-pah-pah  
Pah-pah-pah-pah-pah, pah-pah-pah-pah-pah
