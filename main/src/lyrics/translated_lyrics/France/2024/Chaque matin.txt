**Translated Lyrics: Key Largo, LEDG**

**[Chorus: Digba]**  
Every morning, the cricket wakes me  
I’m lacking sleep  
Selling everything, hero, weed, coke, I’ve  
Got a kind of cocktail  
Change the channel, so I change my neck  
Hanging with my wolves, it drives me mad  
When they talk about the streets while they don’t make cash  
How? (CRU!)  
We sell (CRU!)  
Take back (CRU!)  
Nothing to prove, make your money (Sheesh)  
You hear (CRU!)  
You feel (CRU!)  
The jealousy of all these people (Here)  
And if we have to do it again tomorrow, you do it (Sheesh)  
We’re all looking for cash, so we gotta hustle (Haan)  
Go get everything because no one will give you anything  
No charity here, you know it!

**[Verse 1: JRM]**  
This bitch is Lyca, the phone is PGP  
These sons of bitches want to control me  
JRM, what’s in your backpack?  
The selra, some gold, some mikados  
If I show my face, it’s not for nothing  
If we come in threes, it won’t be for laughs  
The phone, the gun, and me  
No point in running (fleeing)  
We grind until it pays  
Bro, that’s the theme  
Bitch, that’s what you love  
Ask Papo, at 14 years old  
A hoodie, a pair of gloves, and a crowbar  
That’s what we used to do  
But the hunger hasn’t changed  
Cutting up 100Gs, without shame  
Bring your string thong  
Give a good blow job (give a good one, give a good one)  
Give a good one, give a good one

**[Verse 2: MNKS]**  
I make money and I want more  
Enjoy life by reselling death  
He spends all his cash at Louboutin and Dior  
But the fridge at home is empty, my friend, oh  
Her thighs are open all year round  
As many passes as the weed in Nador  
She’s sucked dicks, she’ll suck more  
And her dad still thinks she’ll get her dowry  
Turn up the bass, let the chop drop  
If there are packs on the bench, it’s gotta go  
And if those bitches fuss, they gotta jump  
Emergency stop band on the A1, let’s go  
Hey man, how about stopping the smoke?  
Come take the illicit stuff from the trunk  
And if you like it, you take your subscription  
If you don’t like it, you still take it, you fool

**[Verse 3: Nahir]**  
Hole in the bullet on the joggo tech pack  
Don’t worry, I’m back, I won’t stop  
You remember when we sold the rette-ba  
Made ti-par with the coke in the vespa  
Gone are the days when they were all wasted under Despe’  
I attract the tasps, I lose it like Despo (Rutti)  
It smells like trouble in front of the shop, check the (Gucci)  
Before crossing, analyze them  
Too bad for the featuring, I’m not available  
Go tell Macron I’m going to legalize  
Chocolate shaped like Balisto  
You wait in front of the club since you’re not listed  
At Porte d’Italie, I’m going to screw  
From Boboch’, speeding up to gyCer  
Hoping there are no speed bumps  
Watch your sister  
If I enter the circle  
It’s not in Fianso’s circle, you see the story  
But where does he come from?  
Is he sah?  
Yeah, I’m sah  
Check my bags  
If your crew thinks of rolling up  
Make sure they come masked  
Hoping there’s no mess  
Otherwise, don’t worry, we’ll be back right away  
Rolled

**[Verse 4: Digba]**  
It’s the law of the strongest  
With or without weapons, my old friend  
There are heads that no one touches  
Because of reprisals, my God  
Every day I get up from my bed  
I try to make 100 bucks in my pocket  
To the sound, the chick clings  
Because she wants to get in the Porsche (CRU!)  
400 bucks retail on a glass table (CRU!)  
The state every day, we turn it upside down (Sheesh)  
He’s downing a pe-pom, off in a flash  
To make money, we don’t need tall towers (CRU!)  
Just bad seeds trying not to grow in Fleury  
There are hundreds like me
