**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Gazo & Tiakola]  
The melody is gangx (Hum, hum)  
SHK  
Your guy Sherko is the engineer (Hum, hum)  
Hey (Hey, hey)  

[Chorus: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Parisian, I was with another girl (With another girl), torn apart, I was in a different state (In a different state)  
I admit, I messed up, it was stronger than me (Stronger than me), hey but I'm your number one (But I'm your number one)  
I'm too hot, just know I'm strapped wherever I go (Wherever I go), I'd be lying if I said I'm ready to die (That I'm ready to die, hum, hum)  
But to make it up to you, I'll take you high (I'll take you high, hum, hum), 'cause you're my number one ('Cause you're my number one)  

[Post-Chorus: Gazo]  
With another girl, baby (Baby), in a different state, baby, in a sorry state  
I admit, I really messed up (Really messed up) but you're my number one (Bae)  

[Verse 1: Gazo & Tiakola]  
I don't even have time to see my girl and you want us to talk on the phone  
Instead of asking me: "Who’s that girl?", just tell me which hotel we’re breaking into  
Just let me know if you're open and after the promo, I'll call you back ('call you back)  
I've been drinking mixes, bad vibes, if you want to know which one I'm in  
I should've told you it wasn't so simple being my babe, nah, nah, being my bae, nah, nah, being my bae, nah, nah  
I wouldn't be here if you answer, then we gotta pay but no, we gotta pay but no, we gotta pay but no (Oh, oh)  

[Chorus: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Parisian, I was with another girl (Parisian, I was with another girl)  
Torn apart, I was in a different state (Torn apart, I was in a bad state)  
I admit, I messed up, it was stronger than me (It was stronger than me)  
But I'm your number one (But I'm your number one, hum, hum)  
I'm too hot, just know I'm strapped wherever I go (I'm strapped wherever I go)  
I'd be lying if I said I'm ready to die (That I'm ready to die, hum, hum)  
But to make it up to you, I'll take you high (I'll take you high), 'cause you're my number one (Hum, hum)  

[Verse 2: Tiakola & Gazo]  
And I had too much weight on my shoulders and too many voices in my head  
We've seen each other a few times but you know, I don’t have two like you in my life  
I dreamed of Audemars and Rollies, I saw myself somewhere else than the city  
If I see the road without you (Yeah), don’t worry, I’ll make you understand (Han)  
If our eyes lose contact (Eh), one of us will be happier (Eh, Eh)  
Many tell me you seem innocent (Grah) but you could be in sins and lies  
Not the type to snoop through your messages, may God forgive you in the best way  

[Bridge: Tiakola & Gazo]  
No time to play, I have too many dreams ahead of me, I can't run after you, no, no  
But without you, I feel more dangerous (Dangerous), it's either selling kilograms or singing: "Oh-oh-ah"  
No time to play, I have all my dreams ahead of me, I can't run after you  
Yeah, without you, I feel more dangerous, it's either selling kilograms or singing: "Oh-oh-ah"  

[Chorus: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Parisian, I was with another girl (With another girl), torn apart, I was in a different state (In a different state)  
I admit, I messed up, it was stronger than me (It was stronger than me), eh but I'm your number one (But I'm your number one)  
I'm too hot, just know I'm strapped wherever I go (I'm strapped wherever I go)  
I'd be lying if I said I'm ready to die (That I'm ready to die, hum, hum)  
But to make it up to you, I'll take you high (I'll take you high), 'cause you're my number one (Mm-hmm)  

[Outro: Tiakola & Gazo]  
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
