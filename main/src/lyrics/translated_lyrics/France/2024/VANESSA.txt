**Translated Lyrics:**

(Totally bare, in a bikini, totally bare, in a bikini)

Tonight it’s dark  
We won’t leave anything to chance  
In the Goyard bag  
I’ve got what it takes to shut down the whole club (I’ve got what it takes to shut down the whole club)

Her name is Vanessa  
She loves the night, I’m gonna work that  
She wants my attention  
I’ve lost count of the nights in this scene (ahhhh ahhhh ahhh)  
It’s all set  
She wants to caress me with a bottle  
I’m not counting what I’ll spend  
But tonight she’s gonna cash in (ahhhh ahhhh ahhhh)

She’s heating up your mind (Mind)  
For Chanel Coco (Coco)  
At night on the phone  
She doesn’t hide the curve of her back

She’s heating up your mind (Mind)  
For Chanel Coco (Coco)  
At night on the phone  
She doesn’t hide the curve of her back

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

Yes, we’re living it up for life  
Living it up for the night  
This girl is having fun in Paris at night  
Phone connected to 4 Matic  
When she dances on me, everything’s magic  
Everything’s so magical  
She’s got the handsome guys lined up  
Every night new faces in her bed  
Tonight it’s totally bare  
Caribbean party vibes (ahhhh ahhhh)  
I’m leaving in the morning  
G63 cruising through the city (ahhhh ahhhh)  
She looks so cute  
She makes everyone swoon (ahhhh ahhhh)  
With a unique sway  
She’s turned the street upside down (ahhhh ahhhh)

She’s heating up your mind (Mind)  
For Chanel Coco (Coco)  
At night on the phone  
She doesn’t hide the curve of her back

She’s heating up your mind (Mind)  
For Chanel Coco (Coco)  
At night on the phone  
She doesn’t hide the curve of her back

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini

She’s totally bare  
In a bikini  
Totally bare  
In a bikini
