**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
- How many children do you have? Twenty-three! Twenty-two baby mothers  
Real badman  

[Refrain: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Deserve that I’d call you: "My Love" (Pah, pah), I have time for a little body-to-body (Pah, pah)  
But mamacita wants more than just a fling (Mamacita wants more than just a fling), she wants a baby to bloom (Ouh-ouh)  
I have to give it back right away, I caress down low and kiss her on the neck (Mal)  
Even when I'm asleep, she wakes me up again (Yeah, she wakes me up again), she wants a baby to bloom (Ouh-ouh, yeah, yeah)  
Hum, hum, how to sing about her body? Her water? (Eh), I’m informed, I think her name is: "Mami Wata"  
How to sing about her body? Her water? I’m informed, I think her name is: "Mami Wata"  

[Verse 1: Tiakola & Gazo]  
And her empty words that didn’t enter my heart, and her empty words that didn’t enter my heart  
I just wanted some info, but it only increased my fear (Originally, she was natural, she must have transformed her body)  
So I have to keep all my strength to protect my own, I know, I’m one of the few who hasn’t touched her curves  
Because I know the power of Mami Wata, she always gets what she wants  
I don’t know what move she’s preparing, when she walks into the room, her body goes: "Boom" (Boom)  
I don’t know what move she’s preparing, when she walks into the room, her body goes: "Boom" (Boom)  
I don’t know what move she’s preparing, when she walks into the room, her body goes: "Boom" (Boom)  
I don’t know what move she’s preparing, what move, what move (Boom)  

[Refrain: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Deserve that I’d call you: "My Love" (Pah, pah), I have time for a little body-to-body (Eh)  
But mamacita wants more than just a fling (Mamacita wants more than just a fling), she wants a baby to bloom (Ouh-ouh)  
I have to give it back right away, I caress down low and kiss her on the neck (Mal)  
Even when I'm asleep, she wakes me up again (Yeah, she wakes me up again), she wants a baby to bloom (Ouh-ouh, yeah, yeah)  
Hum, hum, how to sing about her body? Her water? (Eh), I’m informed, I think her name is: "Mami Wata"  
How to sing about her body? Her water? I’m informed, I think her name is: "Mami Wata"  

[Verse 2: Gazo]  
Feels like she wants to enchant me, unlock my little sealed heart  
Really focused on wanting to try, sorry, don’t mind me now  
Bae, in the heat of the moment, I couldn’t say: "I love you", glad I didn’t fall for it but I almost did (Oh)  
Even if I’ve had a bit to drink, you won’t see me falter for you (Mal)  

[Refrain: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Deserve that I’d call you: "My Love", I have time for a little body-to-body (Oh, oh)  
But mamacita wants more than just a fling (Mamacita wants more than just a fling), she wants a baby to bloom (She wants a baby, ouh-ouh)  
I have to give it back right away, I caress down low and kiss her on the neck (Mal)  
Even when I'm asleep, she wakes me up again (Yeah, she wakes me up again), she wants a baby to bloom (She wants a baby, yeah, yeah, ouh-ouh)  
Hum, hum, how to sing about her body? Her water? (Eh), I’m informed, I think her name is: "Mami Wata"  
How to sing about her body? Her water? I’m informed, I think her name is: "Mami Wata"
