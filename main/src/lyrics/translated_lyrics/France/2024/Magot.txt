**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Werenoi]  
2K On The Track  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Hook  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
Ouh-ouh-ouh-ouh  

[Verse 1: Werenoi]  
I have a heart that's hard to find like a cyborg, slide, you're looking for a needle in cement (In cement)  
You want to wage war with ten bullets? It's dead, like Russian roulette with six rounds  
I’m not talking about a barber when I say you don’t have the right cut  
God knows I'm not here to be number one, but I know it's the right path  
Beret like a Peaky Blinder (Blinders), I don't call out the crews of fakers  
They think I don’t know they’re liars, I talk to the manager, not the seller  
You're tough but you'll get nothing without the nine, you're heated but man, you lack cold blood  
She saw love in a sixty-nine, I saw death in a sixty-three  

[Bridge: Werenoi]  
We’re sixty-four when there are sixty cops, we’re not angels, not choir boys  
We climb, we descend like the CAC 40, you get lifted for less than 60K  
We want the sum with the decimal, the Kala' raises the decibels  
They come back at two on a black T-Max, when life leaves you, it’s so beautiful (So beautiful, so beautiful)  

[Chorus: Werenoi & SCH]  
Too many horses ('vaux), more than at the races (Races), I’m in the vessel (Vessel), I have no blood to spill (Spill)  
It’s us the rude boys (Boys), four rings, RS6 (Six), we take the stash (Yes) without saying: "Thank you" (Thank you)  
Under the porch (Oh), I dreamed of breaking through ('cer), all for the stash (Oh) and the sirens rocked me ('cé)  
Thirty and I attach two (Two) to reload ('ger), I don’t wait for the cash to drop (Drop), man, I’m going to get it  

[Verse 2: SCH & Werenoi]  
I’m what love owes to hate, I’m what day owes to night (Night)  
I’m going to make a terrible racket coming out with the iron, remind you what silence owes to noise (Noise)  
Black eyes, raised by widows, posted in a Macan S (Yes)  
My head and my heart are sulking, so I look at them as if they had my coin  
A black oven deep in my belly (Yes), I have more dead friends than seasons (Oh)  
A few reasons to take some gas and start a war near the house (House)  
The scars hurt as much as their gaze, lethal phrasing, mathafack  
I know how to drive a gun, since I’m tall enough to reach the pedals (It’s solid)  
In front since I was little, full of shit for ten or fifteen years (Years)  
High beams, I overtake on the right, dirty money without sweaty hands  
Thumbs up, I’ve counted too much cash, I know how to assemble it, disassemble it (Dee-s', dee-s')  
The wind turns, the last become first, I listen to neither the: "They say," nor the: "Wess Wess"  

[Chorus: Werenoi & SCH]  
Too many horses ('vaux), more than at the races (Races), I’m in the vessel (Vessel), I have no blood to spill (Spill)  
It’s us the rude boys (Boys), four rings, RS6 (Six), we take the stash (Yes) without saying: "Thank you" (Thank you)  
Under the porch (Oh), I dreamed of breaking through ('cer), all for the stash (Oh) and the sirens rocked me ('cé)  
Thirty and I attach two (Two) to reload ('ger), I don’t wait for the cash to drop (Drop), man, I’m going to get it  

[Outro: Werenoi]  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  
Ouh-ouh-ouh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  
Ouh-ouh-ouh  
Ouh-ouh-ouh-ouh
