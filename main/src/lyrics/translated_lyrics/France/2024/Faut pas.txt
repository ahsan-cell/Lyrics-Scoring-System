**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: JuL]  
Ouch, ouch, ouch-ouch-ouch (Boumi')  
Ouch, ouch, ouch-ouch-ouch (You know I don't like to do this)  
Ouch, ouch, ouch-ouch-ouch  
Ouch, ouch, ouch-ouch-ouch  

[Verse 1: JuL]  
My head is full (My head is full)  
Leave me alone, yeah  
So many problems (So many problems)  
They don’t know me, they hold a grudge  
Let them come see what I live (I live)  
Trial after trial  
Right now Marseille feels sad  
Only bullets are falling  
I think I’ll wear khapta tonight*  
On my grandpa, I’m on edge  
It’s just disappointment, they don’t look at me for who I am  
They look at me because I sell records  
Just her drives me crazy, I tell her I’m in the studio, she thinks I’m playing games (Yeah, yeah, playing games)  

[Chorus: JuL & PLK]  
Don’t (Don’t, ah, ah)  
Tell me you’re my friend if you don’t love me (If you don’t love me, ah, ah)  
You’re full of “I’ll come later” but you never show up (But you never show up, ah, ah)  
I did good for you and you don’t remember  
I’ve been wandering solo in the city, didn’t move all summer  
I shared a few struggles with some fake friends, those bastards repeated everything  
I’m questioning myself, solo, at home  
Mom was right, friends change like the seasons  

[Verse 2: PLK]  
Yeah, I’m solid like Malcolm’s father (De-Dewey)  
United like a brother from the Daltons  
This year, I didn’t release albums, I made plenty of tracks, but kept them all for myself (So I smile)  
Doing wrong or right, it’s a big dilemma  
Twenty-one, the knife, masked like Osimhen  
My buddy will pay for everything out of pocket, he thought he saw the cops, he tossed the bag (Oh, yes)  
Ambitious like Barksdale  
I need plots, rivers, bridges (Rivers, bridges)  
You’re bland like a dish without salt  
A rapper without stages, a seller without cash (Eh, eh)  
You’re lying, saying I’m the bad guy, in life there are things we know but don’t say (Huh)  
We’ve known each other since the Kipsta cleats, you make me jealous, hateful, tell me what’s going on  

[Pre-Chorus: PLK]  
I can’t stop thinking  
I smoked that green weed, my blood’s high, I’m stoned  
I’m not waiting for your news anymore, the train just keeps moving  
To the sound of the Kalash, the devil just keeps dancing (Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta)  

[Chorus: JuL & PLK]  
Don’t (Don’t, ah, ah)  
Tell me you’re my friend if you don’t love me (If you don’t love me, ah, ah)  
You’re full of “I’ll come later” but you never show up (But you never show up, ah, ah)  
I did good for you and you don’t remember  
I’ve been wandering solo in the city, didn’t move all summer  
I shared a few struggles with some fake friends, those bastards repeated everything  
I’m questioning myself, solo, at home  
Mom was right, friends change like the seasons
