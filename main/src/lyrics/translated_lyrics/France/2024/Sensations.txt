**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I’m rediscovering sensations  
My heart, it’s a sun  
Boumi  
Baby, you’re my passion fruit  
You’re beautiful even when you wake up  

[Verse 1]  
I’ve turned too much, I don’t know what to do  
From the Zodiac, I’m doing backflips  
They ask me for photos, yeah, even my mom  
I need to keep my feet on the ground  
On my mother’s life, a cross for those who act all high and mighty  
You lose people when you come out of hardship  
Look at our faces, we’ve suffered  
With all the problems, we’ve learned to cope  
I see all of Corsica from the air  
We didn’t take the most expensive flight  
At the airport, I exit from the back  
Armored SUV, that picks me up  

[Chorus]  
I’m rediscovering sensations  
My heart, it’s a sun  
Baby, you’re my passion fruit  
You’re beautiful even when you wake up  
I’m rediscovering sensations  
My heart, it’s a sun  
Baby, you’re my passion fruit  
You’re beautiful even when you wake up  

[Verse 2]  
I’m with the crew on a little ride, we stop by the village bar  
When you come out of the mess, it’s to mama you go for the villa  
They ask me, “What’s your perfume?” I say, “It’s Prada, mixed with the scent of Meuda”  
With life, I’m just fighting, I need a back massage  
They ask me, “What’s your perfume?” I say, “It’s Prada, mixed with the scent of Meuda”  
With life, I’m just fighting, I want to mess things up  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Ouh, oh-oh-oh  
It’s been a long time since I felt khapta, stylish  
It’s been a long time since I dressed well  

[Chorus]  
I’m rediscovering sensations  
My heart, it’s a sun  
Baby, you’re my passion fruit  
You’re beautiful even when you wake up  
I’m rediscovering sensations  
My heart, it’s a sun  
Baby, you’re my passion fruit  
You’re beautiful even when you wake up  

[Verse 3]  
Calm down, we’ll get through the winter, with a hat and a warm coat  
Mistakes, there are degrees for me to tolerate  
We don’t forgive when we’re angry  
How can I not be disappointed?  
They see Jul, they think about getting noticed  
Why is it that every time I like someone, we have to say “Goodbye”?  
Be careful with your circle  
I’m so paranoid that I don’t even trust my neighborhood  
To the gardening society  
I want to make myself even rarer since I’ve gotten older, since I’ve gotten older  
And if I pull out the gun, I’m off with the crew like Pablo in Narcos  
Don’t waste your time running, even money rots  
For that, some want to rob  
Run  
Or mug tourists  

[Chorus]  
I’m rediscovering sensations  
My heart, it’s a sun  
Baby, you’re my passion fruit  
You’re beautiful even when you wake up  

[Bridge]  
Let’s live hidden, let’s live happy  
I can say I’d leave as a hero  
I love seeing my niece, my nephew  
They grow up too fast, it’s too much  

[Outro]  
I’ve gone so fast on the highway of life that I see no one in the rearview  
Originally, I’m like everyone else, I take the bus and the metro
