**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: tags]  
So lazy  
Junior Alaprod, my friend  

[Verse 1: Guy2Bezbar]  
Who’s this shot like Rooney?  
Who’s this shot like Rooney?  
I take her up in the ride  
Tequila Sunrise every day, every day, every day  
A little shot on the side, that’s how I roll  
Tequila Sunrise every day  

[Chorus: Guy2Bezbar & JEY BROWNIE]  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello"  
I’ve got yellow bills on me  
She tells me her name is Élodie  
I take her with me to the penthouse  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello"  
I’ve got yellow bills on me  
She tells me her name is Élodie  
I take her with me to the penthouse  
Looks like she’s in the mood, oh yeah  
I think she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah  
Looks like she’s in the mood, oh yeah  
I believe she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah  

[Verse 2: JEY BROWNIE]  
When I see her, my head goes ra-pa-pa-pa-pa  
I’ve got purple bills that go ra-pa-pa-pa-pa  
I keep her close like a Glock ra-pa-pa-pa-pa  
I’ve got purple bills that go ra-pa-pa-pa-pa  
Time feels limitless  
In you, I’ve uncovered the mystery  
We’ll surely meet again  
I think she’s caught the vibe  

[Chorus: Guy2Bezbar & JEY BROWNIE]  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello"  
I’ve got yellow bills on me  
She tells me her name is Élodie  
I take her with me to the penthouse  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello"  
I’ve got yellow bills on me  
She tells me her name is Élodie  
I take her with me to the penthouse  
Looks like she’s in the mood, oh yeah  
I think she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah  
Looks like she’s in the mood, oh yeah  
I believe she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah  

[Verse 3: Josman]  
The shot like Samuel Eto'o  
The shot like Samuel Eto'o  
I wanted the world, so I woke up very early  
I still have brothers in the ghetto  
The cash, the precious metals (metals)  
The silver, the network  
She wants the good life, the gifts (gifts)  
Baby wants to taste the cake  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello" (hello)  
Kisses on the phone (phone)  
Breakfast in bed on a tray  
Then I light up the gelato  
I step into your memories  
Your smiles and your sighs  
You and me on the boat  
The cherry on top of the cake  

[Chorus: Guy2Bezbar & JEY BROWNIE]  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello"  
I’ve got yellow bills on me  
She tells me her name is Élodie  
I take her with me to the penthouse  
She speaks English, I reply "Hello"  
I’ve got yellow bills on me  
She tells me her name is Élodie  
I take her with me to the penthouse  
Looks like she’s in the mood, oh yeah  
I think she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah  
Looks like she’s in the mood, oh yeah  
I believe she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah  
I think she’s caught the vibe, oh yeah
