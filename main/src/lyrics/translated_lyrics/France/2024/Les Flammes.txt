**[Intro]**  
Young and stubborn, I hang out on the corner, I feel dizzy every day  
I watch time and the wheel turn, my little voice tells me to go back  
I looked the sky in the eyes, asked for forgiveness, but will it grant me?  
The flames in my eyes burn my cornea  

**[Verse 1]**  
I have so many regrets, so many secrets, the walls are surprised  
I've made so many efforts, my heart weighs tons  
Many times, I had to leave, screw the borders of men  
Exactly noon, I step out of the sauna, midnight hits, I heal my traumas  
Time flies, I hit a coma, I'm tired of this life  
The leaves that die and fall, too many tears melting away  
Because the flames in my eyes ignite when I'm solo at night (At night, oh-ah, I'm solo at night)  

**[Chorus]**  
In my eyes, I have flames, flames, flames, flames, flames  
I can't declare my flame to you, baby, I've lost the flame  
I try to avoid the flames, the flames, the flames, yeah  
If I hurt you, I'm sorry, it wasn't intentional  
It's not personal, no, you know I have so many flaws  
I'm just trying to stay honest and rational, no  
Sparkles in my eyes, sparkles in my eyes  

**[Bridge]**  
Young and stubborn, I hang out on the corner, I feel dizzy every day  
I watch time and the wheel turn, my little voice tells me to go back  
I looked the sky in the eyes, asked for forgiveness, but will it grant me?  
The flames in my eyes burn my cornea  

**[Verse 2]**  
The flames in my eyes burn my cornea, I asked for forgiveness, will it grant me?  
Despite the discordant path, we were the last in line  
I wanted to see my mom adorned with diamonds, I wasn't even born yet, I was already stubborn  
I worked hard, I worked hard, I did chores  
Ask those close to me, they were there when it got tough  
Now I'm overwhelmed, now I'm overwhelmed, time doesn't let go for a second  
I wait for the gong, I probe, the moribund waves  
Leaves that die and fall, a lot of tears melting away  
Because of the heat from bullets and bombs (bullets and bombs)  
I hear the thunder rumbling, the cries of pain from the world  
The flames in my eyes burn my cornea, my iris, and my retina  
I see only fire, I see only flames, I see only flames  
I have burns in my soul, body, heart, and eyes  
Time won't let me go, the blood no longer flows  
I feel the ants, I smoke and feel dizzy all day  
How many times was I on the ground and my little voice told me to go back?  
How many times did I doubt, doubt, doubt myself, doubt you?  
In what state, I wonder, in what state will I find myself at the end of the road?  
Oh, how much does it cost? Oh, be careful of the return of flame or stick  
We pay the price of our actions, I think back to this marathon, alone on the balcony  
Of the boss's suite  

**[Bridge]**  
Young and stubborn, I hang out on the corner, I feel dizzy every day  
I watch time and the wheel turn, my little voice tells me to go back  
I looked the sky in the eyes, asked for forgiveness, but will it grant me?  
The flames in my eyes burn my cornea  

**[Chorus]**  
In my eyes, I have flames, flames, flames, flames, flames  
I can't declare my flame to you, baby, I've lost the flame  
I try to avoid the flames, the flames, the flames  
In my eyes, I have flames, flames, flames, flames, flames (Flame)  
I can't declare my flame to you, baby, I've lost the flame  
I try to avoid the flames, the flames, the flames
