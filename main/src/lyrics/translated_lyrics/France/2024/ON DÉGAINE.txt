**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Wait, wait, wait, cut the sound, cut the sound, let all my shooters in  
Jojo, it’s strong  

[Chorus]  
You draw, we draw (You draw, we draw)  
You draw, we draw (It’s strong, it’s strong)  
You draw, we draw (Okay, okay)  
You draw, we draw (Jojo)  
You draw, we draw  
You draw, we draw (Ouh)  

[Verse 1]  
Operation, opé-, dragon operation, call me, I’m ready, war, I don’t say no  
The guys told me "Okay, we need to load the cannons," I keep leading, star on the medallion  
It’s the Attack on Titan, I control the battalion, dark is the melody, play softly on the piano  
You draw, we draw, we get back in the Viano, call me G2B, Adriano’s firecracker  
Call me G2B, Adriano’s firecracker, for all the real OGs, the ride is fully black  
Remember when I didn’t have my place in the game, I came back stronger in dragon operation  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  

[Chorus]  
You draw, we draw (You draw, we draw)  
You draw, we draw (You draw, we draw)  
You draw, we draw (You draw, we draw)  
You draw, we draw (It’s strong, it’s strong)  
You draw, we draw (Okay, okay)  
You draw, we draw (Jojo)  
You draw, we draw  
You draw, we draw (Ouh)  

[Verse 2]  
You draw, (We draw), you draw, (We draw)  
They didn’t want us, they judged our style  
All my life they told me "work for the next one"  
I can’t manage my emotions like Eren  
My hatred intensifies, my tears flow like a fountain  
Ambition, I don’t stop, day and night I train  
Working to succeed, come let’s help each other  
Even at the top, I’d never see my retirement  
Even at the top, I’d never see my retirement  
I stand by my words while many regret (It’s shooting)  
Cutting off heads, effortlessly, with a machete  
Impacting the world, pulling the trigger  

[Outro]  
Operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation, opé-operation  
Opé-o'
