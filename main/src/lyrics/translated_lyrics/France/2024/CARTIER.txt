**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Gazo]  
SHK  
Ready, ready, ready  
Hey, hey, hey  

[Refrain: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Full VVS on my Cartier (Eh), even your girl arrives with wide eyes (Eh)  
Watch over the hustle like we watch over the cash (Eh), gunshot to see them scatter (Gunshot, gunshot, han)  
I have memories from before, when I looked at the price, it’s the trials that made me who I am  
Today, I’m getting closer to the Bugatti (Han, han), I watch over family and the cash  

[Bridge: Tiakola & Gazo]  
We’re gonna lift them up, we’re gonna lift them up (We gotta lift them), Gazo forever, Tiako' forever (The melody is gangx)  
We’re gonna lift them up, we’re gonna lift them up (We gotta lift them), Gazo forever, Tiako' forever (The melody is gangx)  

[Verse 1: Gazo]  
Angry like Vegé', gotta smoke the Piccolo, big veggie tea, I’ve got eco-friendly substance  
Acting crazy, he’s under dolo, "pah-pah" in his polo, drop the melody like Holon, I’m too iced to roll  
I’m not in elementary, who are my complementary guys? Many scammed me like Hush Puppy, I was down, they left but there’s R  
R on my life, my Gaz', my balls, who wants to come back, I dare you, when there are dirty sheets, it’ll want to slip away without a return  

[Refrain: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Full VVS on my Cartier (Eh), even your girl arrives with wide eyes (Eh)  
Watch over the hustle like we watch over the cash (Eh), gunshot to see them scatter (Gunshot, gunshot, han)  
I have memories from before, when I looked at the price, it’s the trials that made me who I am  
Today, I’m getting closer to the Bugatti (Han-han-han), I watch over family and the cash (It’s, it’s too violent)  

[Verse 2: Tiakola]  
I didn’t plan to give it but that was all I had to offer, money, we take, it’s too violent but that was all I had to offer  
I did things fully so they wouldn’t cry rivers, past relationships ended like Djibril on a stretcher  
From Monday to Monday, demons want to sabotage my prayers but I don’t hear them, I’m like the people down below (I’m like the people down below)  
Daring to please the opps, you’ll learn if you fail, many want to make noise as if they’re the ones shooting (Shoot, shoot, shoot)  
In discussions, it’s talking in millions, it’s hot, I’m here to take my share, I leave no trace, without saying: "Nice to meet you"  
I protect my cash, my family, I ice with Eastern weapons, in the company of my bro, the best  
Jinga air from West Africa, RDC, it’s my fortress, just in case, you can get informed  

[Bridge: Tiakola]  
It’s too violent yet I didn’t want to do it, I didn’t want to give it but that was all I had to offer, yeah  
As a kid, I dreamed of bringing in thousands, now that I have some, it’s hard to stay among them  

[Refrain: Gazo & Tiakola]  
Full VVS on my Cartier (Eh), even your girl arrives with wide eyes (Eh)  
Watch over the hustle like we watch over the cash (Eh), gunshot to see them scatter (Gunshot, gunshot, han)  
I have memories from before, when I looked at the price, it’s the trials that made me who I am  
Today, I’m getting closer to the Bugatti (Han, han), I watch over family and the cash  

[Outro: Tiakola & Gazo]  
We’re gonna lift them up, we’re gonna lift them up (We gotta lift them), Gazo forever, Tiako' forever (The melody is gangx)  
We’re gonna lift them up, we’re gonna lift them up (We gotta lift them), Gazo forever, Tiako' forever (The melody is gangx)
