**Translated Lyrics:**

I spin the wheel to hit the jackpot  
I see three sevens light up, a transaction I’m in  
Full ascent  
The elevator goes down, like truth I take the stairs (I just keep climbing)  
I’m not in the mood to party, I’m chasing success  

No more time, no more themes, I won’t fit into their system  
If I fall, only my mother will be there to assist me  
I observe, it’s only under Cartier that I see their true face  
Triple seven in twenty-one, savage like in Blackjack  
Tick tock tick tock, I see time passing  
Too many grams  
I’ll sell it all with Mendoza  
I’m hustling before falling for Vanessa  
On the corner, I’m in cartel mode for the dollars  

It’s not all rosy in the ghetto  
I need the machine to give me some Yellow  
Shooting star, I’ll do it solo  
For cash, I rely on my melody  
It’s not all rosy in the ghetto  
I need the machine to give me some Yellow  
Shooting star, I’ll do it solo (solo)  
For cash, I rely on my melody

Cautious, heart sealed, to free it will take sums  
I take the right path and change the game  
Mean, it’s not who I was but this life hasn’t given me gifts  
Loaded, I’m heading to Key Largo  

I’m watching the plan, I stay focused (I’m focused)  
Involved like Scofield, I slip through the net  
Sometimes I tell myself stop the music, Velas tells me don’t do that (Don’t do that, no)  
Face to face with myself, I say RS what’s up (No te preocupes Corazón)  
I’m not in the mood to party, I’m chasing success  

We want the cash to splurge in the VIP suite  
An OG life with VVS like Sheef G (Sheef G)  
I’m in the Audi, leaving the past behind  
I’ve taken risks (I’ve taken risks)  
I’ve taken risks (I’ve taken risks)  
In the crosshairs, I’m chasing the Dayton (Dayton)  
I haven’t been washed clean, I deserve more than anyone (anyone)  
I’d like to settle down but there’s too much temptation (temptation)  
They want to catch me but I’m in motion  

It’s not all rosy in the ghetto  
I need the machine to give me some Yellow  
Shooting star, I’ll do it solo  
For cash, I rely on my melody  
It’s not all rosy in the ghetto (ghetto)  
I need the machine to give me some Yellow (yellow)  
Shooting star, I’ll do it solo (solo)  
For cash, I rely on my melody  

Cautious (cautious)  
Heart sealed (heart sealed)  
To free it will take sums (nah nah...)  
I take the right path and change the game  
Mean (mean)  
It’s not who I was (not who I was)  
But this life hasn’t given me gifts  
Loaded, I’m heading to Key Largo (to Key Largo)
