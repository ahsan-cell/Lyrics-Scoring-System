**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Christophe Maé]  
Love makes people dream,  
It gives life, a dizzying rush, little boys running around.  
Love lifts people up,  
It makes you blush, it makes you lie, it simply feels good.  
Love makes people cry,  
It brings smiles, it brings moans, it spreads joy all around.  
Love changes people,  
It sparks conversations, it empties the space around.  
It turns us into happy souls,  
It makes us lonely souls too.  
It makes you lovers,  
And us, your soulmates.

[Chorus: Amadou & Mariam]  
We are well, my love,  
Love, love, love.  
Everything is fine, my love,  
Love, love, love.

[Verse 2: Christophe Maé]  
Love can ruin people,  
It blinds you, it makes you foolish, it deafens you.  
Love gives wings to people,  
It makes you float, it empties the space around.  
It turns us into happy souls,  
It makes us lonely souls too.  
It makes you lovers,  
And us, your soulmates.

[Chorus: Amadou & Mariam]  
We are well, my love,  
Love, love, love.  
Everything is fine, my love,  
Love, love, love.

[Verse 3: Christophe Maé]  
Love makes you travel miles,  
It makes you turn off lampshades.  
It makes you smoke a cigarette, love,  
It slims down silhouettes,  
It breaks lampshades,  
It makes you stop smoking, love.

[Chorus: Amadou & Mariam]  
We are well, my love,  
Love, love, love.  
Everything is fine, my love,  
Love, love, love.  
We are well, my love,  
Love, love, love.  
Everything is fine, my love,  
Love, love, love.
