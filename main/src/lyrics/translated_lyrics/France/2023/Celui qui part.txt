**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
And if I had just one word left  
I’d say there’s nothing more beautiful  
Than a final goodbye  
And even if we truly believed it  
I’ll wait for your return for a long time  
And if I had just one word left  
I’d say it’s not the fault of the one who leaves  
But of the one who foolishly waits  
Without understanding they’ll have to live without

[Chorus]  
I’ll be everywhere you want  
If you’ll have me  
And if you find someone better  
I want to see them with you  
I’ll be everywhere, where you want  
If you’ll have me  
And if you find someone better  
I want to see them with you

[Verse 2]  
And if I had just one word left  
I’d thank the other  
For what I could believe  
And wherever the wind takes them  
I’ll be a little bit there at the same time  
And if I had just one word left  
I’d say it’s not the fault of the one who leaves  
But of the one who foolishly waits  
Without understanding they’ll have to live without

[Chorus]  
I’ll be everywhere you want  
If you’ll have me  
And if you find someone better  
I want to see them with you  
I’ll be everywhere, where you want  
If you’ll have me  
And if you find someone better  
I want to see them with you

[Bridge]  
And I’ll be there if life sweeps you away  
If your heart feels cold  
If you ever seek a place  
I’ll watch over it for you

[Chorus]  
I’ll be everywhere you want  
If you’ll have me  
And if you find someone better  
I want to see them with you  
I’ll be everywhere, where you want  
If you’ll have me  
And if you find someone better  
I want to see them with you

[Outro]  
And if I had just one word left  
I’d say there’s nothing more beautiful  
Than a final goodbye
