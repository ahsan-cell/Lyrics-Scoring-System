**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Bigflo]  
Maybe in ten years, there'll be no more forests  
Maybe the sea will have evaporated  
Maybe we'll try to change the air  
Maybe it's already too late to do that  

[Verse 2: Oli]  
Maybe we've already lost the fight  
Maybe we'll all have a chip in our arm  
Maybe no one will say the word "thank you"  
Maybe water will be bought at the pharmacy  

[Pre-Chorus: Bigflo & Oli]  
Seconds feel longer  
When your head's underwater  
Is it the end of the world?  
Or the start of something new?  

[Chorus: Bigflo & Oli]  
No  
It can't be the last one  
Last, last, last one  
Last, last, last, last  
It can't be the last one  
Last, last, last one  
Last, last, last, last  
It can't be the last one  
It can't be the last one  

[Verse 3: Bigflo]  
One last smoke for one last worry  
One last birthday for one last candle  
One last time together, one last with you  
One last novelty, one last first time  

[Verse 4: Oli]  
Did you see on TV they say the world is doomed?  
That's what I heard, but the ad cut in  
We just have to sign, everything's already filled out  
Tell me who to believe if even hope doesn't believe in itself  
Everything looks small from the top floor  
We're the future they imagined in the Middle Ages  
I want a multicolored flag in this violent reality  
From the last dinosaur to the first flying car  

[Pre-Chorus: Bigflo & Oli]  
Seconds feel longer  
When your head's underwater  
Is it the end of the world?  
Or the start of something new?  

[Chorus: Bigflo & Oli]  
No  
It can't be the last one  
Last, last, last one  
Last, last, last, last  
It can't be the last one  
Last, last, last one  
Last, last, last, last  
It can't be the last one  
It can't be the last one  

[Bridge: Bigflo & Oli, Jean-Pierre Jeunet]  
You don't have glass bones  
You can bump into life  
Where is the world taking us?  
We're going to live anyway  
Are we arriving soon? (soon)  
Where is the world taking us?  
We're going to live anyway  
Are we arriving soon? (soon)  
Where is the world taking us?  
We're going to live anyway  
Are we arriving soon? (soon)  
Where is the world taking us?  
We're going to live anyway  
Are we arriving soon?  

[Chorus: Bigflo & Oli]  
It can't be the last one  
Last, last, last one (the last one)  
Last, last, last, last  
It can't be the last one  
Last, last, last one (na-na-na)  
Last, last, last, last  
It can't be the last one  
It can't be the last one
