**Translated Lyrics:**

I could play the false hero in the midst of flames  
Start over for a little extra soul  
I could look you in the eyes  
Tell you that everything will be alright  
I’ll turn up the music louder to drown out the outside noise  

**[Chorus]**  
Come on, let’s go  
I’ll take you far away to watch the world collapse  
There’ll be salty popcorn  
There’ll be a new world at our feet  

**[Verse 2]**  
I could speak sweet words among the women  
The first domino of your heart that starts to race  
I could look you in the eyes  
Tell you that things were better before  
Turn the music up louder to drown out our regrets  
I’ll hear the applause smothering the flames  
I’ll extinguish the chaos, you’ll be my wife  
And we’ll look into each other’s eyes  
Saying that tomorrow will be better  
I’ll sing even louder so they can hear me outside  

**[Chorus]**  
Come on, let’s go  
I’ll take you far away to watch the world collapse  
There’ll be salty popcorn  
There’ll be a new world at our feet  
Come on, let’s go  
I’ll take you far away to watch the world collapse  
There’ll be salty popcorn  
There’ll be a new world at our feet  
Come on, let’s go  
I’ll take you far away to watch the world collapse  
There’ll be salty popcorn  
There’ll be a new world at our feet
