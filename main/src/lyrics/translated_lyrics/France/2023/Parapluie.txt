**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Winter morning on the landing, you come back home  
Your cold gaze, wet hair, you won't explain it  
I've embraced all your flaws, I’ve come to find them beautiful  
The cry of your heart sounded false, like my very first songs  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tell me it’s really us who have wrinkled the sheets  
Tell me it’s you and me  

[Chorus]  
She tells me she’s faithful but she goes out in the rain  
I think I saw her at the hotel Monday night with him  
She spends hours getting pretty but is eager to escape  
Madame goes out every night, without her umbrella oh-oh-oh  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
She goes out without her umbrella  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
She goes out without her umbrella  

[Verse 2]  
Winter garden, the flower has wilted, I wouldn’t know  
How to please you or how to love you, I don’t recognize you  
Why all these mysteries? But tell me what game you’re playing  
I live under the same roof as a stranger who drifts away day by day  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tell me it’s really us who have wrinkled the sheets  
Tell me it’s you and me  

[Chorus]  
She tells me she’s faithful but she goes out in the rain  
I think I saw her at the hotel Monday night with him  
She spends hours getting pretty but is eager to escape  
Madame goes out every night, without her umbrella oh-oh-oh  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
She goes out without her umbrella  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
She goes out without her umbrella  

[Bridge]  
Madame doesn’t care (doesn’t care) about anything (about anything) the rain on her neck  
She goes from rendezvous to rendezvous  
Madame doesn’t care (doesn’t care) about anything (about anything) the rain on her neck  
She goes from rendezvous to rendezvous  

[Chorus]  
She tells me she’s faithful but she goes out in the rain  
I think I saw her at the hotel Monday night with him  
She spends hours getting pretty but is eager to escape  
Madame goes out every night, without her umbrella  
She tells me she’s faithful but she goes out in the rain  
I think I saw her at the hotel Monday night with him  
She spends hours getting pretty but is eager to escape  
Madame goes out every night, without her umbrella oh-oh-oh  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
She goes out without her umbrella  
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh  
She goes out without her umbrella  

[Outro]  
She goes out without her umbrella  
She goes out without her umbrella
