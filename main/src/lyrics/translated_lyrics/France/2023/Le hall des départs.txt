**Translated Lyrics:**

Those who stay are always sad  
It's like being here  
Watching you leave  

The protagonist is the hall of goodbyes  
I know you have to go  
But wait a little longer  
So we can look at each other in detail  

In the arrivals hall  
Something sacred unfolds  
We hear the beating heart  
As footsteps draw near  

It's the hall of reunions  
Where time stands still  
Where desires run wild  
I never quite know where I stand  

[Chorus]  

Soon we'll be close (the arrival of departure)  
Soon we'll be far away (that's why we're always late)  
Soon we'll be near or far  
But it's only temporary!  

[Instrumental]  

In the departures hall  
I always wear a sad smile  
I can't wait to see you again  
My dear protagonist  

It's the hall of handkerchiefs  
We always think a bit of the worst  
More than just goodbyes  
These are "I love you no matter what"  

In these halls too vast  
I see only you  
And I hope as I leave  
That you decide to stay here  

I'll be on time for your flight  
Your hand in mine, we'll laugh  
So we won't miss any  
Of our Hollywood hugs  

[Chorus]  

Soon we'll be close (the arrival of departure)  
Soon we'll be far away (that's why we're always late)  
Soon we'll be near or far  
But it's only temporary!  

Soon we'll be close (to the arrival or the departure)  
Soon we'll be far away (that's why we're always late)  
Soon we'll be far away, yes far  
But it's only temporary!  

Soon we'll be close (to the arrival or the departure)  
Soon we'll be far away (that's why we're always late)  
Soon we'll be far away, yes far  
But it's only temporary!  

Temporary
