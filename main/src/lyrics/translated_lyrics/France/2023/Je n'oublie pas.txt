**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Here (here)  
On a piece of paper  
A few words erased from you  
Me (me)  
I’ll never be the same again  
I’ll try anyway, and you?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So that’s it, in memory  
We don’t invite it, it doesn’t want to leave  
I want to stop it (I want to stop it)  
It needs to be stopped  

[Chorus]  
I forgive you but I won’t forget  
I cope with it but I won’t forget  
What we lived through can’t be forgotten  
I left you my heart, don’t forget it  
We live with it but we won’t forget  
We pretend but we won’t forget  
And this song, will you forget it?  
I left you my heart, don’t forget it  

[Post-Chorus]  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten  

[Verse 2]  
Let go (let go)  
They say time heals  
That it’s never too late, as if that were true  
I’m still clinging to the past  
It’s so outdated, it’s nonsense  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So that’s it, in memory  
We don’t invite it, it doesn’t want to leave  
I want to stop it (I want to stop it)  
It needs to be stopped  

[Chorus]  
I forgive you but I won’t forget (I won’t forget)  
I cope with it but I won’t forget  
What we lived through can’t be forgotten  
I left you my heart, don’t forget it  
We live with it but we won’t forget (we won’t forget)  
We pretend but we won’t forget  
And this song, will you forget it?  
I left you my heart, don’t forget it  

[Post-Chorus]  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten (I haven’t forgotten)  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten  

[Chorus]  
I forgive you but I won’t forget  
I cope with it but I won’t forget  
What we lived through can’t be forgotten  
I left you my heart, don’t forget it  
We live with it but we won’t forget  
We pretend but we won’t forget  
And this song, will you forget it?  
Will you forget me?  

[Post-Chorus]  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten  
I haven’t forgotten, I haven’t forgotten
