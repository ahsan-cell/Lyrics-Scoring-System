**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
That's just how life goes  
Why did you do this to me?  

[Verse 1]  
Like a piece of glass that time has polished  
We go through the trials that the sky chooses for us  
On the school benches, memories linger  
A smile, a scent, a scar, a gesture  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I hesitate, I doubt, I fall, I learn  
But nothing ever truly erases  
The things we've done for far too long  

[Chorus]  
That's just how life goes (That's just how life goes)  
We'll never agree  
How will it end?  
Why did you do this to me? (Why did you do this to me?)  
We're tearing apart again  
We don't even know why anymore  

[Post-Chorus]  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, yeah (It's crazy what we do)  
You see the things we do, yeah (The things we do)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, it's crazy what we do  
You see the things we do (You see the things we do, yeah)  

[Verse 2]  
There's like a taste of error in the hallways of the past (We were wrong)  
What we admit in half-words, we avoid thinking about  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I hesitate, I doubt, I fall, I learn  
But nothing ever truly erases  
The things we've done for far too long  

[Chorus]  
That's just how life goes (That's just how life goes)  
We'll never agree  
How will it end?  
Why did you do this to me? (Why did you do this to me?)  
We're tearing apart again  
We don't even know why anymore  

[Post-Chorus]  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, yeah (It's crazy what we do)  
You see the things we do, yeah (The things we do)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, it's crazy what we do  
You see the things we do (You see the things we do, yeah)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, yeah (It's crazy what we do)  
You see the things we do, yeah (The things we do)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, it's crazy what we do  
You see the things we do (You see the things we do, yeah)  

[Bridge]  
This wasn't planned, all the harm we've done to each other  
If it all started here, we erase, we redo  

[Chorus]  
That's just how life goes (That's just how life goes)  
We'll never agree  
How will it end?  
Why did you do this to me? (Why did you do this to me?)  
We're tearing apart again  
We don't even know why anymore  

[Post-Chorus]  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, yeah (Tell me it's crazy what we do)  
You see the things we do, yeah (You see the things we do)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, it's crazy what we do  
You see the things we do (You see the things we do)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, yeah (It's crazy what we do, yeah)  
You see the things we do, yeah (You see the things we do, yeah)  
Tell me it's crazy what we do, it's crazy what we do  
You see the things we do (You see the things we do, yeah)
