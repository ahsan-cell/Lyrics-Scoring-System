**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I need to get some air  

[Verse 1]  
Dark gaze into the void  
I stare at what's left of my future  
My memories turn liquid  
I wish to leave this ship  
And in the end, I'm wasting my time  
How can I lose myself so much?  
The wind rises, I'll try to be a survivor  
At the tip of my lips, the words await me  
They tighten but never fall  
Deep inside, I'm made of catacombs  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I have the stopwatch in my head  
How many dreams will it take for the hours to stop?  

[Chorus]  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I no longer think like before  
I need to get some air  
I want to reach the light  
I feed on distance  
To feel my existence  
I need to distract myself  
But I'm at the bottom of hell  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I need to get some air  
I want to reach the light  

[Verse 2]  
Delaying tears is a solution  
I become the enemy of my reason  
I become the friend of my impulses  
I'll hide among the shadows  
I'm seduced by the pits  
Seduced like Faust  
I draw closer to my flaws  
I no longer have sleep  
I no longer have awakening  
And yet the night no longer offers me advice  
I no longer have sleep  
I no longer have awakening  
It's complex to exist, but at least I try  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I have the stopwatch in my head  
How many dreams will it take for the hours to stop?  

[Chorus]  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I no longer think like before  
I need to get some air  
I want to reach the light  
I feed on distance  
To feel my existence  
I need to distract myself  
But I'm at the bottom of hell  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I need to get some air  
I want to reach the light  

[Bridge]  
Since when did I go astray?  
Because I feel so off-center  
I'm not the same anymore  
I'm not the same  
I no longer know the theme  
I chase the Sun  

[Chorus]  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I no longer think like before  
I need to get some air  
I want to reach the light  
I feed on distance  
To feel my existence  
I need to distract myself  
But I'm at the bottom of hell  
I'm overwhelmed by time  
I need to get some air  
I want to reach the light
