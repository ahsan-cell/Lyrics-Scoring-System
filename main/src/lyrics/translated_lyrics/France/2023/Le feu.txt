**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Vianney]  
I don't have the words to soak up your pain  
I only have my hands to share my own  
I've worked tirelessly, counting no weeks  
I didn't steal the life that I bring you  
I never wanted it to smother ours  
I did everything for "us" to prevail  

[Verse 2: Kendji Girac]  
I knew you were simple, but I saw you alone  
You were all dimmed, yet so young  
Oh, why? (Oh, why?)  
Tell me, why? (Oh)  
So, I had to row harder to bring you back  
Deep in my eyes, I lit a fire  
Oh, for you (Oh, for you)  
Just for you  

[Chorus: Kendji Girac & Vianney]  
I make you the promise  
Of the best of myself  
And let the downpour come  
I’ll protect the embers  
I make you the promise  
Of a life full of light  
And let the snow fall  
I’ll protect the embers  

[Post-Chorus: Together & Kendji Girac]  
The fire (Oh-oh)  
The fire (Oh-oh, eh)  

[Verse 3: Kendji Girac]  
I can't fight against the wind  
And hold back what I feel  
I want you to know my desire  
I can't move the clouds  
But I can be your warmth  
Whenever you want  
Just ask me  

[Verse 4: Vianney]  
You were solitary  
Thoughtful  
I thought of you as strong  
I didn't understand  
Oh, why? (Oh, why?)  
Tell me why  
Take my heart  
I give you my song  
For when it gets cold  
It has made a fire  
Burning  
Burning  

[Chorus: Kendji Girac & Vianney]  
I make you the promise  
Of the best of myself  
And let the downpour come  
I’ll protect the embers  
I make you the promise  
Of a life full of light  
And let the snow fall  
I’ll protect the embers  

[Post-Chorus: Together & Kendji Girac]  
The fire, oh-oh  
The fire (Oh-oh, eh)  

[Bridge: Kendji Girac, Vianney & Together]  
My musical promise  
For your hellish days  
When you cry  
I promise to be there  
I promise you a blazing fire  
A thousand flames  
Deep in my eyes  
I lit a fire  
Deep in my eyes  
I lit a fire  

[Chorus: Kendji Girac & Vianney]  
I make you the promise  
Of the best of myself  
And let the downpour come  
I’ll protect the embers  
I make you the promise  
Of a life full of light  
And let the snow fall  
I’ll protect the embers  

[Post-Chorus: Kendji Girac & Vianney]  
The fire (Oh-oh)  
The fire (Oh-oh, eh)
