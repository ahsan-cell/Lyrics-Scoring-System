**Translated Lyrics:**

Was it a dream  
Or a bad movie  
An Italian woman  

He was her man  
Her essential one  
She loved him naïvely  
Her bohemian  

She was awkward  
She was right, above all  
The debauchery  
God, what disgust  

That word in her pocket  
She understood in an instant  

Mamma Mia  
How foolish I was  
He wasn’t clumsy  
But dishonest  

Mamma Mia  
How foolish I was  
But here I am free  
I will be the queen without a king  
I will be the queen without a king  
And I don’t care about you  
And I don’t care about you  

Did she dress up?  
Two years pass by  
Was she blind  
Or just foolish?  

Is every man an animal?  
Was it really not so bad after all?  
She still thinks of it  
When she falls asleep  

She was awkward  
She was right, above all  
How ugly it is  
When suddenly  

Mamma Mia  
How foolish I was  
He wasn’t clumsy  
But dishonest  

Mamma Mia  
How foolish I was  
But here I am free  
I will be the queen without a king  
I will be the queen without a king  
And I don’t care about you  
And I don’t care about you  

Is every man an animal?  
Was it really not so bad after all?  
I stack up piles of questions  
So very mundane  

The problem, I wonder if it’s me  
Let the cuckold understand who can  
I’ll burn everything, even your house  
Poor you  

Mamma Mia  
How foolish I was  
He wasn’t clumsy  
But dishonest  

I said Mamma Mia  
How foolish I was  
But here I am free  
I will be the queen without a king  
I will be the queen without a king  
And I don’t care about you  
And I don’t care about you
