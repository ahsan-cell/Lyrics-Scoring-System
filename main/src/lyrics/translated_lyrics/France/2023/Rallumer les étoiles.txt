**Translated Lyrics:**

Water is rare  
And to descend  
To the deepest part of oneself  
The structure is solid  
I can see it  

Giving life back to the years  
Also rekindling the taste for love  
Learning to write oneâ€™s wounds  
In the sand  
That whispers  

I feel it  
I feel it  
I feel it  
I feel love  

God made us in His image  
And to better turn the page  
No regrets for the past  
I feel love  

Reignite the stars  
Reignite the stars  
Reignite the stars  
Reignite the stars  

Counting the hours  
Even late  
Realizing  
That we no longer fear the dark  
Welcoming within our depths  
Our flaws  

Just a detail  
No longer hurting ourselves  
Just a detail  
The flood after me  

I feel it  
I feel it  
I feel it  
I feel love  

God made us in His image  
And to better turn the page  
No regrets for the past  
I feel love
