**Translated Lyrics:**

My father loves football  
He shouts, "Go the Reds!"  
In his mind,  
Shh, he's asleep  
Let's not wake him up  
My mother, without a doubt,  
Dreams of a boy scout,  
Captain aboard the Santa Maria  

**[Chorus]**  
I would like to know the law of feelings  
Hearts on fire burn in winter  
It's hard to understand, love is fascinating  
It turns the world upside down  
Oooh  
I am the child of the toreador and Saint Mary  
Oooh  
Will you give me death, or meaning to my life?  

**[Verse 2]**  
My mother has taken up football, for her captain  
Who, in return, shines on stage  
My father on a riverboat  
Dreams away, saying nothing, cradled by the sky  
So  

**[Chorus]**  
I would like to know the law of feelings  
Hearts on fire burn in winter  
It's hard to understand, love is fascinating  
It turns the world upside down  
Oooh  
I am the child of the toreador and Saint Mary  
Oooh  
Will you give me death, or meaning to my life?  
Oooh  
I am the child of the toreador and Saint Mary  
Oooh  
Will you give me death, death, death, death...  

**[Bridge]**  
I'm looking for a girl from another galaxy  
Who could make me love everything and its opposite  
I'm looking for a girl from another galaxy  
Who could make me love everything and its opposite  

**[Chorus]**  
I am the child of the toreador and Saint Mary  
Will you give me death, or meaning to my life?  
I'm looking for a girl from another galaxy  
I am the child of the toreador and Saint Mary  
I'm looking for a girl from another galaxy  
Will you give me death, death, death, death...  

**[Outro]**  
I'm looking for a girl from another galaxy  
Who could make me love everything and its opposite  
I'm looking for a girl from another galaxy  
Who could make me love everything and its opposite
