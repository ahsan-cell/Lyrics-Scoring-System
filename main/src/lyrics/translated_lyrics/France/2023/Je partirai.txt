**Translated Lyrics:**

Tell me if I'm asleep or if I'm really here  
I close the blinds, searching for the light within me  
In my body, there must be something like that  
Tell me if they don't love me as much anymore  
Here, hatred kills, damn, I don't understand  
Why do I serve as bait for them?

**[Chorus]**  
I will leave  
When the party's over  
When the stars have lost their shine  
To remain eternal  
I will leave  
In the midst of the storm  
I blaze like a comet  
You know, nothing stops me  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)

**[Verse 2]**  
Look at me  
I'm collapsing, get your cameras out  
In the crowd, I throw myself into your arms  
And above all, keep a piece of me  
Don't hold it against me if I create a film or a drama  
I'm walking on a thread that unravels beneath my feet  
I'm looking for a place to be myself  

**[Chorus]**  
I will leave  
When the party's over  
When the stars have lost their shine  
To remain eternal  
I will leave  
In the midst of the storm  
I blaze like a comet  
You know, nothing stops me  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I will leave (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
