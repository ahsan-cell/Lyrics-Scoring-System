**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Vianney]  
Some thought they were alone  
Abandoned, there, on the threshold  
We want to change all that, but oh dear  
Oh dear  
Some would like us to tear each other apart  
For tickets, for an empire  
We want to change all that, but oh dear (oh dear)  
Oh dear  

[Chorus: Vianney, Kendji Girac & Soprano]  
And you who traded "I" for "we"  
Who would give the world to the needy  
Down here, you are crazy (eh, yeah)  
And you (and you) who reaches out to the one who has nothing  
Without holding a grudge against the one who has it all  
If for that, you are crazy (you are crazy, crazy)  
I am crazy (laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï)  
I am crazy (laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï, laï)  
I am crazy  

[Verse 2: Kendji Girac]  
Some thought they were disturbing (they were disturbing)  
Too different, too out of place (too out of place)  
We want to change all that, but oh dear (oh dear)  
Oh dear  

[Verse 3: Soprano]  
And forget the people who divide us  
It's time we heal ourselves  
Let all the crazy ones get ready  
At the starting line  
Don't talk about conspiracy  
And the other, and the other, he has a good excuse  
Let's start by changing ourselves  
Oh dear  

[Chorus: Kendji Girac, Soprano]  
And you (and you) who traded "I" for "we" (oh, oh)  
Who would give the world to the needy (to the needy)  
Down here, you are crazy (eh, yeah)  
And you who reaches out to the one who has nothing  
Without holding a grudge against the one who has it all  
If for that, you are crazy  
I am crazy  
I am crazy  
I am crazy  

[Bridge: Vianney]  
We will change ourselves  
We will change  
We will change ourselves  
We will change  
We will change ourselves  
We will change  
We will change ourselves  
We will change  

[Chorus: Vianney, Kendji Girac, Soprano]  
And you (and you) who traded "I" for "we" (for "we")  
Who would give the world to the needy  
Down here, you are crazy (you are crazy, eh, yeah)  
And you who reaches out to the one who has nothing (who has nothing)  
Without holding a grudge against the one who has it all (who has it all)  
If for that, you are crazy  
I am crazy  
I am crazy  
I am crazy  

[Outro: Vianney, Kendji Girac, Soprano]  
We will change ourselves  
We will change  
We will change ourselves  
We will change (I am crazy)  
We will change ourselves  
We will change  
I am crazy
