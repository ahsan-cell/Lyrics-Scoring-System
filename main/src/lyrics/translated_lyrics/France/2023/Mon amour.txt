**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
My love  
Tell me what you're thinking  
Does all of this make sense?  
Sorry if I'm bothering you  
My love  
Do you remember us?  
Our first date?  
It was beautiful, it was crazy  

[Chorus]  
I love you, I don't know why  
I replay the scene  
But it's always the same ending that starts again  
You don't hear  
What about my pain?  
Do you love me, or not?  

[Verse 2]  
My love  
I'll do everything I can  
An ocean in the fire  
The impossible if you want it  
Oh, my love  
Come back to Paris  
Do it for us, I beg you  
I promise, I've understood  

[Chorus]  
I love you, I don't know why  
I replay the scene  
But it's always the same ending that starts again  
You don't hear  
What about my pain?  
Do you love me, or not?  

[Bridge]  
Tell me the place, I'll wait for you  
And if you don't come, I'll wait for you  
It's silly, I know, but I'll do it  
Filled with hope, I'll wait for you  

[Chorus]  
I love you, I don't know why  
I replay the scene  
But it's always the same ending that starts again  
You don't hear  
What about my pain?  
Do you love me?  

[Outro]  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me, or not?
