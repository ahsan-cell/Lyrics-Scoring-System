**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Since people saw each other differently  
It's different from what I chose to be  
Blood ties fade away with time  
By the great one, where the stars are born  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Desert of sand swept away by the wind  
Where the snow eventually appears  
I read fables that lied to children  
Even as a kid, I knew how to recognize it  

[Chorus]  
I’m not made for the crowd, that’s what I thought  
Since this world is crazy, why mix in?  
I took a plunge into the crowd to clear my mind  
Since I’m crazy for you, we might as well blend in  

[Post-Chorus]  
Blend in, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh  
Blend in  
Blend in, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh  
Blend in  

[Verse 2]  
From laughter to tears, I’ve seen the feelings  
Come and go, escaping through the window  
Even weapons don’t hurt as much  
As a wounded man who has lost his mind  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Desert of sand swept away by the wind  
Where the snow eventually appears  
I read fables that lied to children  
Even as a kid, I knew how to recognize it  

[Chorus]  
I’m not made for the crowd, that’s what I thought  
Since this world is crazy, why mix in?  
I took a plunge into the crowd to clear my mind  
Since I’m crazy for you, we might as well blend in  

[Post-Chorus]  
Blend in, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh  
Blend in  
Blend in, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Eh-eh-eh  
Blend in  

[Outro]  
Desert of sand swept away by the wind  
Where the snow eventually appears  
I read fables that lied to children  
Even as a kid, I knew how to recognize it
