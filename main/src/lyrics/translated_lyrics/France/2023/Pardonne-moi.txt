**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's eight o'clock in the evening  
And tears are rising up  
I wonder if I've lost your gaze  
Anyway, I'm the only one that matters  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You have sad eyes even when you smile  
That's what reminds me that I'm wrong  
And I wish I could tell you it's over  
But I start again  

[Chorus]  
So I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if I make a big deal out of it  
I don't know how this works  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much  
I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if sometimes I mess up  
Even though I know nothing surprises you anymore  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much  

[Verse 2]  
My heart stops  
I didn't see it coming  
Did I ruin the party?  
I don't know, I'm writing without thinking  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You have sad eyes even when you smile  
That's what reminds me that I'm wrong  
And I wish I could tell you it's over  
But I start again  

[Chorus]  
So I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if I make a big deal out of it  
I don't know how this works  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much  
I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if sometimes I mess up  
Even though I know nothing surprises you anymore  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much  

[Bridge]  
And if you forgive me  
All I can give you  
Is what I have beneath my skin  

[Chorus]  
So I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if I make a big deal out of it  
I don't know how this works  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much  
I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if sometimes I mess up  
Even though I know nothing surprises you anymore  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much  

[Outro]  
I wish you would forgive me  
Forgive me if sometimes I mess up  
Even though I know nothing surprises you anymore  
I have tears flowing every day, just a bit too much
