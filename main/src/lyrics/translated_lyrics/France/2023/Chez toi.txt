**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Slimane and Claudio Capéo]  
I sang my sorrows, on the city bench  
I dreamed of Paris and making it my trade  
And when summer came, I crossed the sea  
"You must know where you come from, my son," as my father used to say  
I sang in my room, I had closed the door  
I screamed my demons, may the devil take them away  
And when summer came, I crossed the sea  
"Andiamo in macchina," as my mother would say  

[Chorus: Slimane and Claudio Capéo]  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother  

[Verse 2: Slimane and Claudio Capéo]  
The frightening boulevards, the cobblestones of Clichy  
The little carpenter accompanied by his friends  
And if it were over there, that I would scream my demons  
That we would find each other, acting foolish together  
It was the last chance, a final meeting  
Dreams are exhausting, but I held on  
And if it were over there that my sorrows were heard  
And if that's how life is more beautiful  

[Chorus: Slimane and Claudio Capéo]  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother  

[Bridge: Slimane and Claudio Capéo]  
Everything separated us, they'll say it's not true  
But I love you anyway  
Everything separated us, they'll say it's not true  
But I love you  

[Chorus: Slimane and Claudio Capéo]  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother  
What's it like where you are, my brother?  
Not so different, my brother  
I love you, even if I don't show it  
But it's better when you're here  
Much better when you're here  
My brother
