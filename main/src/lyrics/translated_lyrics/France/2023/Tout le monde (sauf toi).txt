**[Verse 1]**  
Everyone says the same thing  
In the same gloomy language  
Everyone loves to talk about themselves  
Everyone kisses under the arches  
Everyone craves exoticism  
But everyone stays in the same place  

**[Chorus]**  
Everyone looks the same except for you  
You don’t do any of that  
And it makes me love you like no one else  
Everyone looks the same except for you  
You don’t do any of that  
And it makes me love you like no one else  

**[Verse 2]**  
Everyone knows each other a little  
Then everyone forgets in the midst  
Of a life without stories and without fire  
Everyone lies without batting an eye  
Everyone carries their secrets  
To the grave, everyone falls  

**[Chorus]**  
Everyone looks the same except for you  
You don’t do any of that  
And it makes me love you like no one else  
Everyone looks the same except for you  
You don’t do any of that  
And it makes me love you like no one else  

**[Verse 3]**  
You have your style and your ways  
And you always seem to arrive  
From a long journey at sea  
You have your shadows and your mysteries  
You go, heart slung over your shoulder  
And I just want to watch you do it  

**[Chorus]**  
Everyone looks the same except for you  
You don’t do any of that  
And it makes me love you like no one else  
Everyone looks the same except for you  
You don’t do any of that  
And it makes me love you like no one else
