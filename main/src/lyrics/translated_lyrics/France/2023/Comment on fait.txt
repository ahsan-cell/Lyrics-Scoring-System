**Translated Lyrics:**

Take it lightly  
How do you do it?

From this vague feeling  
I’d like to break free  
How do you do it?

It’s just an attitude  
I improvise my faith  
Just a habit,  
Believe me.

It’s just an attitude  
I don’t have the final word  
On life, at the pace it’s going.

How do we cope  
When we take hits?  
How do we cope?  
I don’t know at all.  
How do we cope?  
In fact, we don’t care.

Dancing in this chaos  
When everything goes wrong  
How do you do it?  
Of these lows and highs  
With our hearts turned upside down  
How do you do it?

It’s just an attitude  
Sometimes I pretend  
Just a habit,  
Believe me.

It’s just an attitude  
I don’t have the resolution  
The harder it gets, the more I believe.

How do we cope  
When we take hits?  
How do we cope?  
I don’t know at all.  
How do we cope?  
In fact, we don’t care.

Give it all, give it all  
Even if I fall again  
Give it all, give it all  
And too bad if I’m wrong.  
To us, the great tides  
To us, the strong winds  
Give it all, give it all  
Even if I fall again  
Give it all, give it all  
And too bad if I’m wrong.  
After all, what does it matter?  
We’ll get through.

How do we cope  
When we take hits?  
How do we cope?  
I don’t know at all.  
How do we cope?  
In fact, we don’t care.

Dancing in this drama  
Taking it lightly  
How do you do it?

From this vague feeling  
I’d like to break free  
How do you do it?
