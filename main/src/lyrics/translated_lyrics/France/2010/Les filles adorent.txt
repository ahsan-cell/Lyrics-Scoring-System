**Translated Lyrics:**

Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn

[Verse 1: JLB]  
Girls love to stroll, oiled bodies on the beach  
They’re sensitive, chatting away by the seashells  
They adore sweet words, kisses here and there  
That we’re tender with them and tell them they’re beautiful  
Girls love to please, love to pout  
Love their veggies and say, "No, I’m not ready"  
They enjoy getting dolled up, needing reassurance all the time  
Hearing that they’re well-dressed, knowing they’re safe and fine

[Chorus]  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn

[Verse 2: OLF and Djouzy Djouz]  
They love shy guys, machos, or romantics  
When you flatter them, they blush, think they’re ugly, fat, or too thin  
When they’re actually perfect, "Hey girl,  
I may not have my head on straight, but I’m between your legs"  
In fashion magazines, they learn it all, they cook like queens  
Chef recipes, they love to hear "I love you"  
They prefer "I’ll make love to you" over "I’ll sleep with you," those two girls are nice  
But something’s off, one’s cool and the other’s not so nice

[Chorus]  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn

[Bridge: KBC]  
Yeah, they love cool stuff  
And some not-so-cool things  
Yeah, you know girls are complicated, but so are guys  
Without them, we’d all be gay, without us, they’d be too, but yeah, you know

[Chorus]  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn  
Girls love to be on top  
Of their game for us, you know  
We men, we play sports  
And make love until dawn
