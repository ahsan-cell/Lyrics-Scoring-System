**Translated Lyrics:**

To fall into your footsteps  
If it's in the city where I was born  
Or just close to my home  
I can't guess  
What your voice sounds like  
And I've wanted to hear it more than once  

But when we see each other  
One day or another  
But when you are there  
That day or another  
I'll know it's you  
Among so many others  
Even without saying a word  
Without saying a word  

I don't know what to touch  
To fall into your fingers  
Bare, we sometimes find  
Our hands in the same place  
I don't know where to look  
But I've understood at times  
That I should have looked ahead  

But when we see each other  
One day or another  
But when you are there  
That day or another  
I'll know it's you  
Among so many others  
Even without saying a word  
Without saying a word  
Without saying a word  
Without saying a word  

But when we see each other  
One day or another  
But when you are there  
That day or another  
I'll know it's you  
Among so many others  
Even without saying a word  
Without saying a word  

I'll know it's you  
Among so many others  
Even without saying a word  
Without saying a word
