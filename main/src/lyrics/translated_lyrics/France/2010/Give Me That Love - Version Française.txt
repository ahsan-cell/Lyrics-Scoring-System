**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Another gray day, I lack the attitude, the will  
Lying on my bed, I know I need to think about getting up  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But I listen to the rain and watch people rush by  
I’d wait for you my whole life if I had to, if I had to  

[Chorus]  
That love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love  

[Verse 2]  
Go that way! Don’t say this, don’t do that  
I couldn’t when I said it, yet I tried a thousand times  
Tried the city’s vibe, the daily grind that rolls on  
I breathe when my sweet Caribbean finally takes shape  
So I seize the moment that passes  
And take the time to see it unfold  
Never giving up, never giving up, never  

[Bridge]  
Keep on walkin’, yeah  
(I keep on walkin’)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But I listen to the rain and watch people rush by  
I’d wait for you my whole life if I had to, if I had to  

[Chorus]  
That love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love  

[Bridge]  
Keep on walkin’, yeah  
(I keep on walkin’)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But I listen to the rain and watch people rush by  
I’d wait for you my whole life if I had to, if I had to  

[Chorus]  
That love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love  
Give me that love, give me that love  
Give me that love
