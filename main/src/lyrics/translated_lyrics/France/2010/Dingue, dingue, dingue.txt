**Translated Lyrics:**

I know we can't go back  
And that you won't come back either  
But if you changed your mind anyway  
I swear you wouldn't be disappointed  
I'd make an effort with my clothes  
I'd come home at the right time  
We'd spend Sundays by the sea  
Like we did in the very beginning  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So let yourself go  
And let me do it  
Yes, let me do it  
I know how to do it, oh  

[Chorus]  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad, tell me where I'm going with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad to have messed everything up with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  

[Verse 2]  
I'll tell my friends how lucky I am  
The ones you don't like, I won't see anymore  
You'll see this time I'll change  
Even if you never really believed me  
I wear my heart on my sleeve  
And my body is lost in things  
I'd rather mess everything up  
Than be sure that it's all over  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So let yourself go (Let yourself go)  
And let me do it (Oh no)  
Yes, let me do it (Let me do it)  
I know how to do it, oh  

[Chorus]  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad, tell me where I'm going with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad to have messed everything up with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  

[Bridge]  
And I'm running after you  
Even if it's late  
And I'm shouting from the rooftops  
The desire to see you again  
It's never too late, oh  

[Chorus]  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad, tell me where I'm going with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad to have messed everything up with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad, tell me where I'm going with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over heels, crazy for you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
It drives me mad to have messed everything up with you  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
'Cause I'm head over, head over crazy for you  

[Outro]  
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)  
(I'm crazy about, about you)  
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)  
(Crazy about, about you)  
Mm, it drives me crazy  
I'm crazy about you  
I'm crazy, crazy about, about you, no  
Oh  
(Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy)  
(Crazy about, about you)
