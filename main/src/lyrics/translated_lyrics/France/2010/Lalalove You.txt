**Translated Lyrics:**

My noisy clamor  
Has not opened the eye of the night  
Cuddled against your body  

I feel as if in a bed  
Of swirls and gold  
My northern winds, my do, re, mi  
From now on are dead  

She tells me she only loves slow songs in English  
And I breathe out a very French Shakespeare  
If my speech stumbles, the intention is there  
When I say: "I love you"  

In a single flower vase, I placed  
My most beautiful bloom  
I carry it to my enamored heart  
And watch this love blossom  

Yesterday, I was like a gray wolf  
Howling at the Moon and dead  
My life, this little hummingbird  
Colors with pleasure  

She tells me she only loves slow songs in English  
And I breathe out a very French Shakespeare  
If my speech stumbles, the intention reigns  
When I say: "I love you"  

She tells me she only loves sweet words in English  
That I breathe out a very French Shakespeare  
If my speech stumbles, donâ€™t hold it against me, Lady  
When I say: "I love you"  

Symphony of sweetness  
Arcadia of splendor
