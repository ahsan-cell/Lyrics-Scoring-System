**Translated Lyrics:**

She fascinates me as much as she disturbs  
I shiver, stabbed by beauty  
It’s like a knife in the soul  
The wound pierces my heart  
And I find joy in the pain  
I intoxicate myself with this poison  
To the point of losing my mind  

**[Chorus]**  
It’s the good that hurts  
When you love, it’s perfectly normal  
Your hatred takes pleasure  
It feels so good to suffer  
Succumb to the charm  
Give your tears  

It’s the good that hurts (It hurts)  
When you love, it’s quite mundane (This good that hurts)  
Your sorrow, the true delights  
Come through the torment  
Lower your weapons  
Give your tears  

I feel violent urges  
I feel like I’m slipping to the bottom  
If I ignore where this plague comes from  
I love having it in my skin  
Enchanted by crazy ideas  
Suddenly my desires take flight  
Desire becomes my prison  
To the point of losing my mind  

**[Chorus]**  
It’s the good that hurts  
When you love, it’s perfectly normal  
Your hatred takes pleasure  
It feels so good to suffer  
Succumb to the charm  
Give your tears  

It’s the good that hurts (It hurts)  
When you love, it’s quite mundane (This good that hurts)  
Your sorrow, the true delights  
Come through the torment  
Lower your weapons  
Give your tears  

I feel violent urges  
I feel like I’m slipping to the bottom  

**[Chorus]**  
It’s the good that hurts  
When you love, it’s perfectly normal  
Your hatred takes pleasure  
It feels so good to suffer  
Succumb to the charm  
Give your tears  
It’s the good that hurts (It hurts)  
When you love, it’s quite mundane (This good that hurts)  
Your sorrow, the true delights  
Come through the torment  
Lower your weapons  
Give your tears
