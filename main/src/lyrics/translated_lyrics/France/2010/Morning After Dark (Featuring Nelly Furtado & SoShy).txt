**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Timbaland]**  
When everything is going well, I’ll stay the same  
When everything is going wrong, I’ll stay the same  
I won’t be the first to bloom  
But I’ll be the last to close  
I don’t know if I’ve given you a chance yet  
Beautiful, I’m looking at your style  
Do I think you’re good enough? Yes  
There’s a way to understand this  
Come to me, darling  
You don’t care, you’re not afraid of my wildness  
You want it from head to toe  
The question is - will you let it out?  
Anyway, the hourglass is running  
Either way, I’m not worried  
Why can’t you see where this is going?  
Come on, let’s explore  

**[Timbaland & Nelly Furtado]**  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
(After the dark-)  
Dawn has broken, get lost, find your own way  
(After the dark-)  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
(After the dark-)  
Dawn has broken, get lost, find your own way  
(After the dark morning)  

**[SoShy]**  
I have a little secret for you  
I can never sleep when night falls  
But every time I snap my fingers  
I turn to light  
My moon belongs to your sun  
Your fire burns my mind  
Is this love or just desire?  
It’s something I can’t explain  
Am I the only one for you?  
Because you’re the only one for me  
Waiting for you to come  
Feels like it’s been too long and I felt alone  
It looks bright and early  
I want to close my eyes  
This is an unusual story  

**[Timbaland & Nelly Furtado]**  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
(After the dark-)  
Dawn has broken, get lost, find your own way  
(After the dark-)  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
(After the dark-)  
Dawn has broken, get lost, find your own way  
(After the dark morning)  

**[Nelly Furtado]**  
I need a little R.E.M. but  
I don’t like sleeping alone  
So, just like you turned off the phone  
Come pick me up  
I want to get into trouble  
Then you’ll take me home  
I want to hide  
I just want to shake your bones  
Yeah, I’m the only one  
But I’m not the only one  
So let’s work extra  
And stay up until sunrise on this shift  
Maybe we can create a mess  
Maybe we can burn this city down  
Maybe I’ll become your vampire  
We can explore

**[Timbaland & Nelly Furtado]**  
From the dark, from the dark, from the dark, from the dark, from the dark  
(After the dark morning)  
From the dark, from the dark, from the dark, from the dark, from the dark  
(After the dark morning)  
Please don’t leave me, girl  
(After the dark morning)  
Please don’t leave me, girl  
(After the dark morning)  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
Dawn has broken, get lost, find your own way  
When the cats are out, the bats come out to play  
Dawn has broken, get lost, find your own way
