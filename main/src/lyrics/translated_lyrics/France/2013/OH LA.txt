**Translated Lyrics:**

In my own time, at my ease, just right here  
I took my sleeping pills, my eyes are in the air, believe me  
I said Oh La, hey, oh, in the blue night, Oh La, hey, oh  
I said Oh La, the moon is beautiful when it smiles  
In the blue night, Oh La, hey, oh  

When I see you, when I feel you, when I talk about you, alone  
When I imagine you, when I rewind, when I love you, alone  
I said Oh La, hey, oh, in the blue night, Oh La, hey, oh  
I said Oh La, the moon is beautiful when it smiles  
In the blue night, Oh La, hey, oh  

When I drink hope, my glass is full  
When I dwell in darkness, my glass is full  
I said Oh La, hey, oh, in the blue night, Oh La, hey, oh  
I said Oh La, the moon is beautiful when it smiles  
In the blue night, Oh La, hey, oh, I said Oh La!
