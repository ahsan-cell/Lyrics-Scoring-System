---

I can give you a voice, bred with rhythm and soul  
The heart of a Welsh boy who's lost his home  
Put it in harmony, let the words resonate  
Carry your thoughts in the songs we create  

[Leslie]  
I give you my notes, I give you my words  
When your voice carries them at your own tempo  
A shoulder that's fragile yet strong at the same time  
What I imagine and what I believe  

[Chorus: Leslie & Ivyrise]  
I give you all my differences  
All these flaws that are also chances  
We'll never be 'standards', just people who don't fit the mold  
I give you what I have, what I'm worth  

[Ivyrise]  
I can give you the strength of my ancestral pride  
The will to carry on when I'm hurt deep inside  
Whatever the feeling, whatever the way  
It helps me get through each day  

[Leslie]  
I give you our doubts and our unspoken hope  
The questions that the roads have left in history  
Our girls are dark-haired and we speak a bit loud  
And humor and love are our treasures  

[Chorus]  
I give you all my differences  
All these flaws that are also chances  
We'll never be 'standards', just people who don't fit the mold  
I give you what I have, what I'm worth  
I give you, give you, give you, what I am  

[Ivyrise]  
I can give you my voice, bred with rhythm and soul  
[Leslie]  
I give you my notes, I give you my voice  
[Ivyrise]  
The songs that I love and the stories I've told  
[Leslie]  
What I imagine and what I believe  
[Ivyrise]  
I can make you feel good even when I'm down  
[Leslie]  
The reasons that lift me and this foolish hope  
[Ivyrise]  
My strength is a platform that you can climb on  
[Leslie]  
A shoulder that's fragile yet strong at the same time  

[Chorus: Leslie & Ivyrise]  
I give you, I give you  
All that I'm worth, what I am, my gifts, my flaws  
My greatest chances, my differences  
I give you, I give you  
I give you, I give you  
All that I'm worth, what I am, my gifts, my flaws  
My greatest chances, my differences, I give you
