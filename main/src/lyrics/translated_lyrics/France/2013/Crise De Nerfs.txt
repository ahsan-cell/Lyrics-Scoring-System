**Translated Lyrics:**

"A city that holds one of the highest crime rates in the country  
A city on the brink of a nervous breakdown  
Burglary, settling scores  
Carjacking, drug trafficking  
Cigarette smuggling, robberies  
Marseille is a city under high tension (It's terrible...)"

**[Verse 1: Alonzo]**  
Yeah, it's K.A.S.S.I.M  
In my DNA, there's HLM*  
It smells like death in the afternoon  
The real capital of crime on BFM  
Marseille, there's no more theme  
Feet cracking, it's too hot, it's a sauna  
Khamsa fi ainik, All Eyes On Me!  
The BAC north sells the goods!  
No more men, just zombies!  
Chasing money, 24 hours at Rami  
900,000 euros in cash, Nani's salary  
Yet we know the trashy life of Béné and Many  
Mali, that's life, North District!  
Convenience stores, snacks, consumption, it's dead!  
It's not Vegas, nah! It's more like Baltimore!  
Say hi to my guys from the north  

**[Chorus: Alonzo]**  
Yeah, it's my life, my city  
On the edge of a nervous breakdown  
There's a fire but tell me where are the water bombers?  
It's not the end of the world but everything's speeding up  
And yeah, it's chaos, I swear on my mother's life  
(Hot like in Marseille!)  
Extortion, Kalashnikovs!  
(Hot like in Marseille!)  
Corrupt cops, robberies!  
(Hot like in Marseille!)  
Corruption, unemployment!  
And yeah, it's chaos, I swear on my mother's life!  

**[Verse 2: Vincenzo]**  
OK, start up, press START, or turn the key  
Everyone galloping now, make it purr  
Full beams on the left lane, #A7  
Bomb it, be careful, here it flashes quick!  
Crash tests, we're condemned  
To live for our dreams, without realizing  
Change, #now  
Lie, #Hollande  
We live in fear despite the change in command  
Thanks to Guéant and his politics  
The bidding war here causes too much controversy!  
Too much controversy! (Too much controversy!)  
What to say to parents wondering what the cops are doing?  
Welcome to the southeast, #Mar-West  
Where the sheriffs get caught, #Baumettes  
Too much rain in the networks, but who holds the reins?  
The underground economy is too fast  
Nightlife with my buddies  
4 rings, #S3, we love the big rides  
Kilometers of Go-Fast & Furious!  
To stop hearing the sirens, I play some Notorious  

**[Chorus: Alonzo]**  

**[Verse 3: Soprano]**  
Marcel Pagnol is dead, we found his body in the North District  
The Good Mother cries and floods the Old Port  
Buddy, you're good in Marseille, not in Baltimore  
It's Valérie Kalachnikov redecorating  
Here, the kids have deserted the classrooms  
Buddy, to go wage war at the vault  
Avoid being a Judas  
Here, the hash stories aren't those of Éric Judor  
The crisis has lined the pockets of the biggest dealers  
So since then, the cost of living has lost value  
The fear that a bullet might take a father, a brother, a sister  
Drives you to buy a real weapon of war  
In the midst of the Paoli and Stan Ffields  
Police checks like in The Shield  
I pray for white flags to rise  
On this battlefield that has become my city...  

**[Chorus: Alonzo]**
