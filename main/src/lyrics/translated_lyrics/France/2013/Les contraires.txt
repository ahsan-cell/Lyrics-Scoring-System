**Translated Lyrics:**

Neither of us understands  
Same wind, same desires  
It doesn’t happen to us often  

We wait, we await  
To live the same life  
And yet, and yet  
Only what separates us unites us  

I love, you don’t  
I go out, you stay here  
I rush, you’ve left  
It’s day and it’s night  
I dream that I can fly  
You remain glued to the ground  
What unites us slips away from us...  

The same breath, the same cry  
Why do neither of us understand?  
You pretend, I act as if  
The same blood flows in our veins  

And yet, and yet  
The fights, the unspoken words  
We learn, and the time it takes  
For black and white to marry  

I love, you don’t  
I go out, you stay here  
I rush, you’ve left  
It’s day and it’s night  
You dream that you take off  
I stay glued to the ground  
What unites us slips away from us...  
Catches up with us...  
Pulls us in...  
Inspires us  

And I keep smiling  
And you keep silent  
You fear the worst  
I hope  
Opposites attract  

That I keep smiling  
When you keep silent  
When you sigh  
I hope  
That opposites attract  
Opposites attract
