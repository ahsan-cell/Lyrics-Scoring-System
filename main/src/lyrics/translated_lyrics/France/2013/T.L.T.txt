**[Intro]**  
Back to the Future  
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome  
B2OBA, 92izi, Saddam Hauts-de-Seine  
The Meteorite, Senegal versus Emile Louis Laounizi  
ROH2Hass, TLF disqualified  
You're a liar, pointer... (EMILE!)  
Stay in "Hous'"  
There will be only one left!  
The King remains the King, we’re taking you all down  
I do an intro, outro  
You do intro Outreau  
Dirty pointer!

**[Verse 1]**  
I've been sleeping under the crown for too long, listen to these good-for-nothings complain  
I turned the throne into a California King Bed  
Emile, you are defeated  
Like the tip of your little beard... you're sharp  
What's up, my brother?! What are you planning to do?!  
Your record says you're a pointer, so you are one until proven otherwise  
That other good-for-nothing is doing features with second-rate artists: Jena Lee, Lumidee  
Alert for the checkerboard pointer rapper: Emile Louis Vui'  
You see, I fill Bercy with my fingers up my ass  
Catch your girl on time at school, or Fouiny Babe will take her from you  
You just came out of a Skyrock contest, should I remind you?  
Your name is La Fouine, of course you want to eat at every table  
For you, it will never get better: run, save yourself  
Your little beard helps you tickle the girls  
You are the shame of Yvelines, we should draw and quarter you  
Relentless war like Pyramids against the Tarterêts

**[Chorus]**  
I have no reverse gear, so I can't go back  
The voice of my fathers, of my older brothers tells me "Kill them, kill them!"  
Kill them all, kill them, kill them, kill them all  
Kill them, kill them all, kill them, kill them, kill them!  
I have no reverse gear, so I can't go back  
The voice of my fathers, of my older brothers tells me "Kill them, kill them!"  
Kill them all, kill them, kill them, kill them all  
Kill them, kill them all, kill them, kill them, kill them!

**[Verse 2]**  
In my veins, I have grilled chicken, 47-AK for all the traitors  
Too many girls to sleep with them all, too many sneakers to wear them all  
After this one, will they be able to rise again?  
At the top where I am... In the future where I'm going  
I'm the Boss of the Rap Game, you're just a PDRG*  
Bakel City Gang dreams of derailing you  
Wooden balls, could it even be plywood?  
Heard you’re looking for me, loser, come try to rob me  
L.O.L., Smiley Face'zer  
TLF, Rohff, Emile... Argh! I want to burger  
If you don't protect your back, you should  
B2O, I’m ending careers, for real!  
You want to win back your audience of CPPN students?  
Take off your fake chico, put on your pair of TNs  
Ten years sending jabs, it's time to get smoked foolishly  
I'll do you a favor, I won't even mention your clothing brand

**[Chorus]**  
I have no reverse gear, so I can't go back  
The voice of my fathers, of my older brothers tells me "Kill them, kill them!"  
Kill them all, kill them, kill them, kill them all  
Kill them, kill them all, kill them, kill them, kill them!

**[Bridge]**  
6 in the chamber (They will understand)  
When a white sheet will cover them (They will understand)  
I wonder when it will be… (They will understand)  
Chicos on the ground, careers six feet under, I swear on my mother (They will understand)

**[Verse 3]**  
Instead of violating little ones, sucking dicks, suck my revolver  
In my mind, I'm featuring with little green men  
I make the law in the VIP area, with black guys in the clips  
Fouiny “Pointu-R” Louis, my team sends you greetings  
I only make hits, no need to discuss  
Let’s shoot each other right away, we’re not going to argue  
3.5.7 loaded to send the message  
In our world, happy endings only exist at the massage parlor

**[Chorus]**  
I have no reverse gear, so I can't go back  
The voice of my fathers, of my older brothers tells me "Kill them, kill them!"
