**[Intro]**  
Back to the Future  

**[Verse 1]**  
For them, there's no more hope, red-black  
Kopp A.C. Milan, I'm taking stock  
More violent than MMA  
Like a double strike from Benzema  
What did you think, you could take me down?  
I'm in the future, forget about me now  
But who are you? You interest no one  
Neither LCI nor 92izi  
No one respects you here  
I tell you, I say it again  
I've got a bad bitch on my dick, yeah  
From Friday to Friday, yes-yes  
Attacking me, you never should have tried  
Dethroning the Duke will be something never seen  
Who puts you in a bind? Tall Senegalese with a long sex drive  
R.O.H.2fesses, you can only rob your little hornet  
I strike when you least expect it  
Half-man, half-attack  
TLF, your UFO burns  
Around here, no one loves you, neither man nor woman  
You don't sell any records, don’t even scrape milligrams  
Your lyrics boil down to "pouèt pouèt, prout prout, bam bilibam"  
Welcome to 2013, Kopp A.C. Milan, I'm taking stock  
I'm here to dot the "i"s, feared like Iran  

**[Chorus]**  
Here we do it right, you won't know where it comes from  
Missile, loser, anti-aircraft: it leads to nothing  
There will be only one left, there will be only one left  
There will be only one left, bro, there will be only one at the end  
Izi, izi, cash, izi, izi, cash hey  
There will be only one left  
Izi, izi, beef, izi, izi, beef  

**[Verse 2]**  
They insulted my mother, she who has suffered so much  
I will never forgive them, even when they’re six feet under  
I'm fresh, I'm redefined until the end of the century  
And the real ones know it well, so they know nothing  
Bursting on a Kawasaki, they’ll do nada, klaoui  
Welcome to Tataouine, you're dry, click Sahrawi  
Yes, yes, I win-win, you refuse to step in the ring  
Neither balls nor bling-bling  
We pick your pockets, it just goes "gling-gling"  
FFHOR, you're really in trouble, like Émile Louis Laounizi  
The first rapper pointing fingers, double Uzi for my enemies  
Ikbal, you were in jail, sending me packs of pasta  
Today you talk trash, wallaye bilaye don’t worry  
He speaks French, says nonsense, can we say he’s bilingual?  
In any case, he’s ugly, oh my God, how ugly he is  
Playing criminals, robbing women: oh no!  
La Fouine, aren’t you ashamed? Sexual assault on a child  
Knowledge is a weapon, I’m calibrated, I don’t read books  
I have spikes on my heart like on a pair of Louboutins  
If rap was just you two, it would really just be a big whore  
No diploma, but I’m happy, fuck the zeros on my report card  

**[Chorus]**  
Here we do it right, you won't know where it comes from  
Missile, loser, anti-aircraft: it leads to nothing  
There will be only one left, there will be only one left  
There will be only one left, bro, there will be only one at the end  
Izi, izi, cash, izi, izi, cash hey  
There will be only one left  
Izi, izi, beef, izi, izi, beef, hey  

**[Outro]**  
"- It's Laouni Mouhid, born on the 25th of December '81 in Trappes?  
- Yeah, yeah, he's super famous. And a threat with a weapon, property damage, another theft, extortion. Sexual assault on a minor."  
Well done, Morray!  
"- Outrage against a person on a service mission, sexual assault, two acts of violence."  
Dirty pointer! #ÉmileLouisLaounizi  
R.O.H.2fesses, Housni Wooden-Balls, Zoulette Empire  
Izi, there will be only one left, Morray, you see what I mean or not?  
92izon in the house
