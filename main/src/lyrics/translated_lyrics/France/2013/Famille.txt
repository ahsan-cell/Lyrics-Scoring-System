**Translated Lyrics:**

And break the silence when I think of you  
I’m far from your hands, far from you, far from yours  
But all that doesn’t matter  
I don’t know your home, nor your city, nor your name  
Poor, rich, bastard, white, all black or strange  
I recognize your gaze  

And you’re searching for an image, and you’re searching for a place  
Where I sometimes drift  
You are of my family, of my order and my rank  
The one I’ve chosen, the one I feel  
In this army of simple folks  
You are of my family, much more than blood relations  
A handful of seconds in this strange world  
May it protect you if it hears  

You don’t quite know where you’re going, nor how, nor why  
You don’t believe in much, neither all gray nor all pink  
But what you believe is yours  
You’re part of the losing side, consciously, viscerally  
And you look down but you won’t fall  
As long as we need you  

And you take happiness like grains of grapes  
Little bits of little nothings  
You are of my family, of my order and my rank  
The one I’ve chosen, the one I feel  
In this army of simple folks  
You are of my family, much more than blood relations  
A handful of seconds in this strange world  
May it protect you if it hears  

You are of my family, you are of my family  
Of the same rank, of the same wind  
You are of my family, you are of my family  
Even inhabitants of the same time  
You are of my family, you are of my family  
Let’s cross our lives from time to time  
You are of my family, of my order and my rank  
The one I’ve chosen, the one I feel  
In this army of simple folks  
You are of my family, much more than blood relations  
A handful of seconds in this strange world  
May it protect you if it hears.
