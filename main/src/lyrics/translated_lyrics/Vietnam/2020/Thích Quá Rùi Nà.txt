**Translated Lyrics:**

But when I see you, my heart races (Oh)  
Do you really think we’re meant to be? (Woah)  
Because I say I miss you every time the night falls  
Over this city (Ah)  
At the end of the day (Yea)  
I'm on my way, where are you? I’ll be there soon (Coming through you)  
Baby, call this number (On my phone)  
Send me your location (Or your home)  
I’ll swing by your place, lips brushing your ear (Yia)  
I've got something to say  
Don’t make me feel awkward anymore, because every time I’m near you, it’s like I stop breathing  
And if you’re trying to make me fall for you, don’t get your hopes up  
Because I’m shy, I won’t say it, so I hope you can tell  
This hand wants to touch someone  
This mind only sees one person  
These cheeks of mine are already flushed  
This heart has skipped a few beats  
I know it’s awkward when our eyes meet  
I know my breath stops because someone  
Is standing a little too close for comfort  
And I know I’ve started to like you a bit too much  
How about we meet tomorrow  
And leave love unspoken for now  
So everything feels like it hasn’t begun  
Damn girl, can’t get you out of my mind  
Yo pretty girl, you’ve got style  
Saying I love you  
Then drop the mic  
No need to say much (Woah woah)  
You know your soul has depth, yeah (Woah woah)  
You’re too close, I’m not used to it  
Oh, it’s so awkward, but I like it though, yeah  
Because you don’t know if I should keep pursuing?  
Or take a chance and maybe win you over  
Can you be my girl?  
I just need one sentence that says you know  
This hand wants to touch yours  
This mind only sees us  
These cheeks of ours are already flushed  
This heart has started beating in sync  
I know it’s awkward when our eyes meet  
I know Cupid’s arrow has been shot  
Whether it hits or misses, I’m sure Cupid won’t miss  
And I know we’ve both started to like each other a bit too much.
