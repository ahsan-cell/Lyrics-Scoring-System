Having many connections just makes it wider, huh?  
Relationships in dreams are truly a nightmare.  
But I don’t understand why? On Monday morning, my little brother cried.  
Loneliness has lingered too long; there’s nowhere for these "tears" to flow.

Ahihi  
My ex is such a dog!  
I saw some guy taking you into an alley (Going to lay bricks).  
Fat like a pig, but he’s got money, flaunting chains and riding a SH bike.  
Honestly, if I weren’t in such a mess, that guy wouldn’t stand a chance.

I’m handsome, but I’m in debt quite a bit.  
Some guy invited me to sell crystal meth, but I’m scared it’s too risky.  
Not making much anyway, and with all this stuff, I might end up high.  
There are some older sisters still messaging me, trying to get me to be a sugar baby (Seriously).

But from now until tonight, if I can’t find a way to get money, I’m done for (You’ll see).  
What love at this time? I don’t even have money for food.  
Good friends? How come since morning, all I get are busy signals?  
After 6:30 today, we won’t know who’s better off (Just wait).

Hello, is this Brother Bình Gold?  
I’m Mạnh’s brother; how have you been lately? (Still the same).  
Oh yes, I have something important I need your help with! (Just say it).  
If you can help me this time, I’d really owe you one!

It’s tough!  
I told you to play less.  
When I met you, you were doing services, what did you do to get those lips so chapped?  
Delivering food for birds, but running around like it’s a storm in Hanoi.  
And if you’re not careful, those Buys guys will run you over.

Alright then,  
This afternoon, come here, I’ll take you to Tima.  
You can borrow money on the same day in Hanoi, no need to go far.  
Bring any documents you have; you can borrow as much as you want.  
Just come to get the money, and I’ll handle everything else (Got it?).

Okay, brother!  
Once I get the money, I’ll treat you to some grilled seafood.  
On bridge 361, they’ve just added some new goods, as good as beef.  
White skin, long legs, curves all around, just perfect.  
And if you like, I can call some friends from the countryside to come up.

Forget it, I’m just helping you; I’ve been eating vegetarian lately.  
Back in the day, I’d chase after those cows on the street right away.  
In general, I’m living a healthy life now, no regrets.  
Just invite Mạnh over here for some sweets, and it’ll all go down smoothly.
