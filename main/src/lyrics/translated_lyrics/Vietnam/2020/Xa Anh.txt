**Translated Lyrics:**

I love the sound of my homeland since the day I was born, oh dear
My gentle mother sings distant lullabies
Ah ah oh, the eternal lullaby

[Verse 2: Quỳnh Vi, Nguyệt Anh]
The sound of my homeland, four thousand years of joy and sorrow
Crying and laughing with the fate of the flowing waters, oh water
The sound of my homeland, the voice my mother gave me from the cradle
In a blink of an eye, it became the voice of my heart, oh water

[Verse 3: Mai Thiên Vân]
I love the sounds that fill the sky
The songs of anger and longing that never fade
Forever remembering a distant love
Holding on to dreams of a beautiful tomorrow

[Chorus 1: Female]
I love the song of "Truyện Kiều" (The Tale of Kiều)
As enchanting as the sound of our village's flute
And I love the girl next door
With her sweet words and charming grace, oh how lovely

[Verse 4: Trịnh Lam]
I love my country, lying proudly by the blue sea
Fields waving like the waves of Thái Bình
Looking at the vast ocean singing a song of abundance

[Verse 5: Quang Lê, Trần Thái Hòa]
My country, the Trường Sơn mountains hiding in the sunset
The land of the West waiting for the strength to rise, oh land
My country, the high mountains of the North with sacred fire
Rice in the South waiting for the monsoon, oh rice

[Verse 6: Thế Sơn]
I love the rivers that flow long
Knowing love along the Huong River
Living fully thanks to the Cửu Long (Mekong)
The blood of the Red River flows red with longing

[Chorus 2: Male]
Lovers of the vast world
Embrace with me the fields of Vietnam
How can we spread our wings like birds
Seeing the North, Central, and South united in love

[Verse 7: Như Quỳnh]
I love the farmer, braving the sun and dew by the deep fields
Standing for thousands of years on this poor land
Strong as iron, their colors never fade

[Verse 8: Hương Thủy, Hồ Lệ Thu]
The brown shirt, those mothers of the countryside only know hard work
The children of the countryside play with the buffalo, oh dear
The brown shirt, stretching from the high forest
Leading each other all the way to Cà Mau, oh shirt

[Verse 9: Ngọc Anh]
I love so many people
Lý, Lê, Trần, and who else
The heroes of ancient times
The heroes of a bright tomorrow

[Chorus 3: Female, Male]
Because of love, love for the country, love for the race
In spring, I sing a song, oh what a love song
The green fields of my homeland
My heart blooms like a flower

[Chorus 3: All]
Because of love (Because of love), love for the country (Love for the country), love for the race (Love for the race)
In spring (In spring), I sing (I sing), a song, oh what a love song
The green fields of my homeland
My heart blooms like a flower
