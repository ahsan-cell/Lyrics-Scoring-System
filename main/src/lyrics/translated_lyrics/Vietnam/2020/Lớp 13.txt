**Translated Lyrics:**

Last semester, I wasted my time, leaving school to sit at the internet café  
The worst memory of my life, sitting in a classroom not even 8 meters wide  
I have to spend another 4 years to connect with those dishes from people I hate? (and TAGE!!!)

Put in my eye drops… forget to fold my blanket, slip on socks for soft heels  
Break open my piggy bank like I just entered fifth grade, grab my Air Force Ones from the safe  
Taking shortcuts on my beat-up bike, homework pages all blank because I only care about short skirts, and checking out some curly-haired girls (that’s how I go to school, boy)  
And I hope one day I’ll be the one holding the mic  
Never had the need to sit in class calculating derivatives and square roots  
Forget the pen, instead of doing homework, I turn on YouTube every day  
Watching Dre and Snoop to boost my likes, now's not the time to unsubscribe  
Ey lil bitch! When you have cable TV and watch movies  
When you come home, lie in the air conditioning all afternoon, rapping and feeling high  
Chilling outside on my Dream bike  
While I have to sit in class listening to lectures, waiting for the teacher to write on the board about  
(writing on the board) Marxist-Leninist philosophy  
With-a-head-full-of-rhymes, I feel numb (yo) when the teacher lectures (ey)  
Advanced topics seem simple to me (more than) basic knowledge (ey)  
Those boring exam prep days, open the classroom door, walk out  
Play billiards, then head to the internet café, or play PES or FIFA  
Me and a bunch of country kids go eat pho then sip coffee  
Turn off that K-pop music and listen to white rappers with bleached hair (Marshall, bitch!)  
Strutting confidently, smoking on the principal’s balcony  
Since the day I stepped into class (which class?) since the day I stepped into class (13, EY)  
Just kidding, (wait) I love my teacher the most (hah?)  
Those dizzying numbers make me love advanced math (ah?)  
Grab a few cups of coffee, the school canteen looks like a Starbucks (hah?)  
This is the moment when I (the fuck) This is the moment when I (the fuck you looking at)  
Look for school supplies, (what) sold through Tiki  
Grab a mechanical pencil, no smudges, no 0.85 millimeters  
Silver chain watch, yellow hoodie, baggy jeans  
Brush my teeth, wash my face, have breakfast, then go take the exam (these guys)  
In the exam room, there are all kinds of good folks, even  
There’s a guy dressed like a company director  
A girl with mascara and eyeshadow, a guy who overslept and didn’t show up  
Leaving my homie fuming, there’s a clueless guy, all session just staring down the proctor  
A guy marking answers vertically, drooling on his desk  
Not having earned gold yet, already has the demeanor of royalty  
Guess who it is, the other day you stayed up all night  
Eyes glued to the game until morning, so in the exam, you just write the date and your name  
So what’s the point of studying more, making a living as a rapper  
Rapping until my throat is hoarse, dreaming about the sound of drums at night  
Determined not to give up, ey, if you’re not trying, then just forget it  
Passion since childhood, I gotta be like that white guy in Detroit (Detroit)  
Right now, you keep working on your paper, or step out on the balcony and split a Long Thang bao  
A few letters lined up in a long row, adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing makes my blood pressure rise  
But studying isn’t just you alone, don’t worry, you’ll study with me next year  
I hate studying and don’t need to present, this is the only thing that keeps me interested.
