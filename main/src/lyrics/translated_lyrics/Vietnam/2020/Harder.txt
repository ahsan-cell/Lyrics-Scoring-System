**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Hook]**  
Not a rapper, everyone says I’m really different thanks to  
Jordan Tee, two feet like the Raptors  
Look at my Air, I got double  
You just started going hard, but we’ve been going harder  
Why let yourself be lazy and slack off?  
Don’t say it like I’m someone else?  
Hop on the bass like a trapper  
You just started going hard, but we’ve been going harder  

**[Verse 1]**  
Still a gentleman even though I don’t wear a tie  
Skip over the lame ones because your skills are weak  
You kicked me with those sparkling eyes  
With lashes curled up, but I still won’t follow  
Trying every day to become better year after year  
Get my money, working hard to show my teeth  
Living and working, bank account growing every day  
Don’t try to mess with me, I’m still busy making moves  
No tattoos (Good)  
I step up and it’s fire, no need for a gas tank  
Too bad you guys haven’t been seen, so don’t show off like you’re tough  
Call me the young man from Cau Giay, every time I hit the mic, I know my skills are rising  
Tonight’s a big show, so forget your worries, I’m here to shine  
Pull up on stage with my team, we go harder, locking down this place  
Roll another one, all my brothers in one crew, hands reaching for the sky  
Sippin' the Jei, taking you far away from here, despite the good melodies, I’m flying towards you

Don’t say it like I’m someone else?  
Hop on the bass like a trapper  
You just started going hard, but we’ve been going harder  

**[Verse 2]**  
Repping H-Town, my city  
Keep pretending you wanna be me  
If you want to know what I’m thinking  
Just wait until the music is released  
Bass all day, no matter morning or night  
Melody ringing out again  
Shout out to chewinggeng and youngflames  
The fears I have to try to forget  
Microphone in hand, never stop burning  
Come here and watch, don’t just brag  
Flowing like a machine  
Bringing Wxrdie to a version never seen before  
I’m thrashing around  
Not letting myself settle for just that much  
I’m on my way, get out of my face  
Not a tiger, not a rebel  
No need to flex, no need to check  
Look down to see how the crowd is pushing together  
Then keep rolling all night long even though I know I shouldn’t  
When it’s time to work, I hang out with my gang  
And I have to try to fill the bank, no one bothering in the penthouse
