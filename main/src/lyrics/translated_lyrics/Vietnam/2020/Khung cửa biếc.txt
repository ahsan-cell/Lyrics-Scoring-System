**Translated Lyrics:**

The sun melts into the night, listening to the waves crash ashore  
Wild leaves will fall one day  
The wind hangs high in the late autumn afternoon  

Perhaps it’s too hard to see through  
To look outside at the flowers, the passing train  
Lingering on  
In the azure window frame  

The water sings a sound  
Where does the water flow, for me to seek?  
Don’t regret, the song has been written  
Where does it drift away, as faith fades?  

You are lost in a dream that cannot dim  
When will the bright morning come?  
Who knows where to find, the shade of peace  
To lull the late autumn afternoon  

Perhaps it’s too hard to see through  
To look outside at the buildings, the banyan trees  
A figure passing by  
In the azure window frame  

The water sings a sound  
Where does the water flow, for me to seek?  
Don’t regret, the song has been written  
Where does it drift away, as faith fades?  

Because of longing, the boat hurriedly sailed away  
Because of attachment, the person still stands here  
Yesterday passed by so quickly  
Leaving me here, sitting alone  
Silently gazing through the azure window frame  

The water sings a sound  
Where does the water flow, for me to seek?  
Don’t regret, the song has been written  
Where does it drift away, as faith fades?
