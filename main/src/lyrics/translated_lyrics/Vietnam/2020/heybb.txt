**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Yasin]**  
Bro, I'm on them  
Flexing hard, the whip's chrome  
Time's ticking, the clock's two-tone  
Young ones, they hit, striking your bone, ah  
In love with me  
Gangsta rapper  
In the booth, a real trapper  

**[Verse 1: Yasin]**  
I'm a stamped gangsta rapper  
When I’m in the booth, I’m a true trapper  
No fakers here  
The longer I sit, the colder I get  
Always on top like a striker  
She’s in love with me  
Always finding new ways to show she’s not here for my money, ey, uh  
Please stop being so fucking dramatic  
When I was little, I used to mess with my teacher in preschool  
The guys you hang with are small potatoes  
Go and celebrate, I’m back  
Summertime in Stockholm City  
I overheard some girls say "Yasin plays important"  
Spinning strapped and lit  
You don’t post much when you’re really doing well  
It feels so good to be home  
Airplane mode with a nice flight attendant  
I told her "I’ve rolled a five"  
We’ll have time to smoke before we land in Paris, ey  
Rolled a five  
We’ll have time to smoke before we land in Paris, ey  

**[Verse 2: AB & Faye]**  
Every day’s the same, we like breaking the law  
Free my brother Heybe, he got taken  
Pussy niggas talk but I’m always busy, yeah  
My bro said "Don’t waste energy on these kids," yeah  
My fucking bros leave you speechless  
Lighting Candy Kush in the car  
Sending some letters, free Demon  
Always on us, all the fucking time, yeah  
Yeah, it is what it is, we going lit  
2022, I caught a Henny drip  
Free my bro, isolated, he started tripping  
And he’s my blood, but he’s only banging crips  
Baby’s got a Glock, doesn’t want to dance, dance  
Doesn’t want to take chances, chances  
Meet him face to face, face to face  
If we see them, man, it’s guns, ah, guns, ah  
Ah, can get you lit within a week, sharmuta*  
Nowadays just kids threatening each other  
In the SUV, I’m listening to 2Pac, ey  
Ride on my enemy  
He used to play reckless until this case got him shut down  
You can’t come into the party  
Hit him in the head, forget the vest, yeah (Ah, ah)  
Fixing this Calin without tobacco, brodie  
Two twin Glocks, same as Zack & Cody  
Mac, bro, only money  
Down in the lobby with homies  
Sunset in Nairobi  

**[Verse 3: Yasin]**  
Listen, we’re up here, stop thinking about haters  
Day and night in the studio, trying to get this paper  
Bad behavior, still grinding  
Like a skater, skeleton on my wrist, yah  
Baby, come here, you’ll get a round  
Yeah, in a C-Class in London  
If only I could do it over, over, over  
When I stood and hustled all day long  
Wrote lyrics and stuff with a joint on the balcony  
But I have something new all over the concrete  
Pushing, just met a musht at the platform  
Baby, come here, you’ll get a round  

**[Outro: AB]**  
Bro, I'm on them  
Flexing hard, the whip's chrome  
Time's ticking, the clock's two-tone  
Young ones, they hit, striking your bone, ah  
Free Demon, free—, free Heybe  
E4an, YB and we up
