**Translated Lyrics:**

Home is where my heart finds peace  
And if I'm being honest  
Home is where I'd rather be  

Sometimes, oh how tired I feel  
The crowd and the cars endlessly follow each other  
Sometimes we need tranquility  
Just to go home and find joy  

The feeling from the start that life gives  
Is knowing we're not like other kids, because  
There are days with cool breezes  
And then hot days wrapped in little piles of sand  
I am a house with an empty wooden loft  
No worries about rejection, for peace is in the mind when we sing  
Today I forgot to bring the storm clouds, the rain  
It's time for people to say no to plastic  
Time will tell if we've been waiting long enough  
Life's a bit messy, but music plays in the vacant lot  
Not yet living in style  
I want to see the river fish  
A friend to mess around with  
Blending into Eastern culture, staying out late for mom to worry (wow)  

What comes tomorrow, no one knows  
But there's no place that feels right like home  
They say keep going with the flow  
Here are my roots, here's where I'll grow  
But there's one thing  
I know for sure  
It's in my blood  
It's in my bones  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  

K' (yo) I have a promise to you  
That one day peace will return to this world  
When the sky seems to hesitate about something  
Where human kindness is lacking but the forest is burning  
Black smoke rises high like a helicopter gliding over the frozen lake  
When will humanity understand  
The long speeches about the need to eat  
But more practically, we've killed thousands of species  
To write a menu  
This will be the song I listen to while driving or for my daughter to hear?  
This planet is our home  
Where I've found shelter (Yeah)  

Home is where it started  
Walking down the road every day brings my feet back  
Sometimes we need tranquility  
The blue sky floating over the house is the peace I find when I return  

What comes tomorrow, no one knows  
But there's no place that feels right like home  
They say keep going with the flow  
Here are my roots, here's where I'll grow  
But there's one thing  
I know for sure  
It's in my blood  
It's in my bones  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  

Anywhere I go, anywhere I go  
When I'm losing faith, when I'm losing hope  
That's when I know, that's when I know  
Home is where I'd rather be  
Anywhere I go, anywhere I go  
When I'm losing faith, when I'm losing hope  
That's when I know, that's when I know  
Home is where I'd rather be  

What comes tomorrow, no one knows  
But there's no place that feels right like home  
They say keep going with the flow  
Here are my roots, here's where I'll grow  
But there's one thing  
I know for sure  
It's in my blood  
It's in my bones  
I'm coming home  
I'm coming home  

But there's one thing  
I know for sure  
It's in my blood  
It's in my bones  
I'm coming home
