**Translated Lyrics:**

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
Autumn arrives, why does it rush by?  
I am truly far from you now.  

Eighteen letters written by hand,  
I still can’t finish them all.  
The song hasn’t even begun,  
I know you want to hear it.  

Each dream I’ve had,  
I still can’t remember them all.  
Let the wind carry my sweet words  
To where you are.  

Days keep passing,  
Still, I’m alone in my corner.  
Now,  
I want to say.  

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
The day flowers fall in the fields,  
I know that I have loved.  

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
Autumn arrives, why does it rush by?  
I am truly far from you now.  

Days keep passing,  
Still, I’m alone in my corner.  
Now,  
I want to say.  

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
The day flowers fall in the fields,  
I know that I have loved.  

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
Autumn arrives, why does it rush by?  
I am truly far from you now.  

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
The day flowers fall in the fields,  
I know that I have loved.  

If tomorrow I do not return,  
Please don’t wait any longer.  
Autumn arrives, why does it rush by?  
I am truly far from you now.  
Autumn arrives, why does it rush by?  
I am truly far from you now.
