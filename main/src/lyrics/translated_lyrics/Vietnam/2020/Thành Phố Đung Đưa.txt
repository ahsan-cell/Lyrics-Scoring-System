**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m still dreaming away,  
Roosters crowing loud in the sky,  
Get up right away.  

For today is the weekend,  
A day to pack up and go back to Dad,  
While Mom waits at home,  
From a place far away...  

Just left my bed, I quickly brush my teeth,  
After a quick shower, I dress, forgetting to hang my towel,  
Hastily leaving the room, don’t forget to say goodbye, “I’m off!”  
Running straight to where I know,  
Forming a line, one by one, out the gate we go,  
A familiar figure waiting, not minding the long road.  

Together we speed along the long road,  
Leaning our heads, singing aimlessly to ease the fatigue,  
The road is still quite long, so we’re not in a rush,  
Stopping by a café for some coffee, just for us.  

Clouds of white drift lazily across the sky,  
A flock of birds sings joyfully, adding cheer to life,  
Her smile makes my heart race, forgetting the way home,  
Am I drunk on her, or just high on coffee?!  

The journey grows harder each day,  
Just now the sun was smiling, suddenly it’s crying,  
Saigon this season is quite unkind,  
With unpredictable sun and rain!!  
Looking around for a place to rest,  
Pulling over, stammering, my stomach growls,  
From somewhere, a vendor approaches, “What do you want to eat, dear?”  

Together we’re eating sweet potatoes on the porch,  
Leaning in, feeding each other like two old folks,  
The rain gradually eases, cars sparse on the road,  
Raindrops fall lightly like the city in a mist.  

She puts a hat on me, I wipe down her ride,  
Warm hands intertwined, my heart beats with pride,  
If only it would rain heavily, so we wouldn’t have to leave,  
To sit here longer with her, even if I freeze!
