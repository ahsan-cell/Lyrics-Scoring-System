**Translated Lyrics:**

There are things that feel unsteady,  
Some come without asking for worth,  
Some leave without seeking consent.  

There are ways to love in this life,  
We learn to not expect too much,  
Like the end of the world for the first time,  
Like discovering a shade of purple.  

And it’s been too long since we shared what’s dear,  
Often unaware,  
We have hearts and egos painted in shades of purple,  
In a sky that’s been forgotten.  

It takes a year to cradle a new life,  
It takes twenty years to form an ego,  
And it takes a hundred years to believe that the ego  
Is ultimately just a cradle.  

Of a boy who mistakenly stole his pain,  
When love lies deep in pockets,  
And can’t be given away when seen through brown eyes.  
For so long, thinking love was all gone from within,  
Once loved, once gave,  
Why does every time we love in life, feel like we’re on the edge of the world?  

Aren’t we too far apart, lost in words?  
It seems that in everything,  
So if we carry these pains, will we forgive?  
In every first time knowing loss?  

It takes a year to cradle a new life,  
It takes twenty years to form an ego,  
And it takes a hundred years to believe that the ego  
Is ultimately just a cradle.  

Of a man who has carried his pains,  
When love lies deep in pockets,  
And can’t be given away when seen through brown eyes.  
For so long, forgetting all the love that once was,  
To love oneself, to give,  
Why does every time we love in life, feel like we’re on the edge of the world?  

Tomorrow morning,  
No more pain will remain,  
Tomorrow morning,  
No more pain will remain.  

And I see the bird on the tree nodding,  
I see the flower breaking through hatred,  
I walk towards the end where there is no  
Ego that has carried for so many years.  
I see faith and love in a weary heart,  
I see forgiveness,  
I see the whole world we possess,  
The people who have come since the beginning.  

There are wounds that don’t heal,  
There are things that feel unsteady,  
Some come without asking for worth,  
Some leave without seeking consent.  

There are ways to love in this life,  
We learn to not expect too much,  
Like the end of the world for the first time,  
Like discovering a shade of purple.
