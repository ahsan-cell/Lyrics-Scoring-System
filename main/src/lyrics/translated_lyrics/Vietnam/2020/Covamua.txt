**Translated Lyrics:**

Grass drinks the rain, trembling in its prime  
The rain comes and goes, bewildered, Iâ€™m far from you  

I, the thirsty grass, where is the rain you bring?  
On sunny days, I wait, but the rain never comes  
I wait endlessly, the green grass, lost and confused  

I ask the wind as it blows, I ask the leaves as they fall  
I ask the drifting clouds floating towards the distant horizon  
The grass thirsts for the sound of falling rain  
A person thirsts for the meaning of life, just longing for love  
Love, love, like thirsty grass, like thirsty grass  
Like thirsty grass  

I ask the wind as it blows, I ask the leaves as they fall  
I ask the drifting clouds floating towards the distant horizon  
The grass thirsts for the sound of falling rain  
A person thirsts for the meaning of life, just longing for love  
Love, love, like thirsty grass, like thirsty grass  
Like thirsty grass  
Grass thirsts for rain  

Thirsty grass  
Thirsty for rain  
Love, love, like thirsty grass, like thirsty grass  
Like thirsty grass
