**Translated Lyrics:**

A few stormy nights  
I sit and listen to the thunder's roar  
A few nights without  
I sit and hear the thunder in my heart  

**[Chorus]**  

Then it will pass  
All the pain within us  
At two in the morning, still awake  
What more do you hope to say?  

Then it will pass  
Sadness hiding deep inside  
Twenty years in this world  
Twenty years have gone by  

Oh me  

**[Verse 2]**  

The dreams of long ago have come true  
Yet why does your gaze feel so sorrowful?  
That gaze from the past  
Once held love, now says goodbye  

**[Chorus]**  

Then it will pass  
All the pain within us  
At two in the morning, still awake  
What more do you hope to say?  

Then it will pass  
Sadness hiding deep inside  
Twenty years in this world  
Twenty years have gone by  

Oh me
