**Translated Lyrics:**

Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Get up now!

Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Exercise! Get up!  
Get up! Get up!

What night is it, my friend?  
Get up, it's a brand new day!  
Stretch out to greet the sun,  
Head out to learn and have some fun.

Look around, everywhere you see,  
So many joys are waiting for thee.  
Youth is still in full bloom,  
Why let yourself rest in gloom?

In the early morning, rise and exercise,  
Let the essence of earth and sky fill your cells inside.  
Burn off energy, let the blood flow to your brain,  
Keep your spirit sharp and your body in gain.

Breathe in, breathe out, one, two, three,  
Tuck in your belly, puff out your chest, stretch your arms free.  
It might hurt a bit at first, but don’t you dare slack,  
If you want a break, finish this verse before you relax.

Morning exercise,  
Let’s do morning exercise together.  
Morning exercise,  
Let’s do morning exercise together.

Exercise,  
Exercise,  
Morning exercise,  
Let’s do morning exercise together.

Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Get up now!

Get up! Get up! Get up!  
Exercise!  
Get up! Get up! Get up!

Do you want a firm and shapely body?  
Do you want a beautiful figure but feel too lazy?  
You eat a lot but don’t want to gain weight,  
Then best not to breathe, just wait.  
After work, if you head to the bar,  
Don’t ask why your belly has gone far.

Stand up! Toughen up!  
Let inspiration rise up!  
What difficulties, what pains,  
They’re all just in your brain!  
Yeah!  
Once you want to change,  
Even if the sky falls down,  
Nothing can shake you around!

Breathe in, breathe out, one, two, three,  
Tuck in your belly, puff out your chest, stretch your arms free.  
It might hurt a bit at first, but don’t you dare slack,  
If you want a break, finish this verse before you relax.

Morning exercise,  
Let’s do morning exercise together.  
Morning exercise,  
Let’s do morning exercise together.

Exercise,  
Exercise,  
Morning exercise,  
Let’s do morning exercise together.

Breathe in, breathe out, one, two, three,  
Tuck in your belly, puff out your chest, stretch your arms free.  
It might hurt a bit at first, but don’t you dare slack,  
If you want a break, finish this verse before you relax.

Breathe in, breathe out, one, two, three,  
Tuck in your belly, puff out your chest, stretch your arms free.  
It might hurt a bit at first, but don’t you dare slack,  
If you want a break, finish this verse before you relax.
