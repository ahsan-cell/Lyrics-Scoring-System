**Translated Lyrics:**

Hey!  
Are you okay?  
Let's go!

Carry you across the threshold,  
And then we'll be together all night long.  
Around me, it's pitch dark,  
How long until the streetlights come on out there?

Sometimes I act foolish,  
Sitting next to you in a dream.  
Time flows around me,  
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear, calling me close.

Carry you across the threshold,  
And then we'll be together all night long.  
Around me, it's pitch dark,  
How long until the streetlights come on out there?

Sometimes I act foolish,  
Sitting next to you in a dream.  
Time flows around me,  
Whispering sweet nothings in my ear, calling me close.

Hey!  
Are you okay?  
I love you,  
I love you so much.
