**Translated Lyrics:**

I won’t change my mind  
The path I’ve chosen  
I won’t regret it  

My mother often says  
Life is inherently full of pain  
Nothing comes for free  
The law of survival is the truth  

Good things don’t come easily, people rush in and out  
Swallowing empty promises and fanciful dreams  
Good people fight their whole lives in despair  
No matter how hard they try, the result is still zero  

The bad trample on others with a smirk, then reap the rewards  
Leaving us to ponder the meaning of life  
There are no clear-cut black and white boundaries  
Working hard for 15 hours yet still sleeping on the floor  

Get up  
Claim everything that rightfully belongs to you  
Swallowing bitterness and pain  
I know the foundation of my ambition is sacrifice  

Keep moving forward  
Holding the mic tightly in my hand, besides me  
Not for fame  
Not for girls, not for anyone at all  

A working-class kid wants to reach for the sky  
No money, not dead  
Living on passion without a second thought  

No highs, no lows  
Not waiting for luck  
Stay sharp, don’t let it crush you, okay?  
I understand the reality of this life has no chill  

Let me tell you  
Even knowing life isn’t poetry  
Born with just empty hands  
Still ready to risk it all for my dreams  

Let me tell you  
Even knowing life isn’t poetry  
Born with just empty hands  
Still ready to risk it all for my dreams  

Teeth clenched but eyes wide open  
Honestly, I don’t want to care about comparisons or competition  
Time and again, my efforts treated like trash  
Rotting, worn out in the very place called home  

Finding ways to hold my head high, while the ground is full of thorns  
Responsibilities weigh heavy on my shoulders, searching for the divine to bow down to  
100% stubborn, 200% effort  
300% daring and 1% luck  
What I do  
Is not wrong  
Hope and ambition  
Cannot be just fleeting winds and drifting clouds  

What I do  
Is not wrong  
Hope and ambition  
Cannot be just fleeting winds and drifting clouds  

For the kids who find freedom in screams  
For the kids who feel trapped  
I won’t accept being a puppet of fate  
Settling just to enjoy a little fortune  

Fuck!

Let me tell you  
Even knowing life isn’t poetry  
Born with just empty hands  
Still ready to risk it all for my dreams  

Let me tell you  
Even knowing life isn’t poetry  
Born with just empty hands  
Still ready to risk it all for my dreams  
Don’t live irresponsibly and call it freedom  
Abandoning everything, running away just because you’re afraid of hardship  
Don’t let this society take away your fighting spirit  
Searching for what’s called simple love in places that don’t exist  

It's simple 'cause you got a silver spoon up your fucking ass  
I’m sorry but I can’t chill with you tonight  
I gotta fight for my life  
I gotta take back what I was once wrongfully denied
