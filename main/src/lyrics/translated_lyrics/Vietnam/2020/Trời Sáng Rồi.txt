**Translated Lyrics:**

How long will the rain weigh on my heart?  
The Perfume River waits sadly for someone long gone.  
Oh, my dear, why does my heart drift like fleeting clouds?  
It still holds love, still lingers, frail and thin, as leaves fall all around,  
Staining the yard with gold, fate has turned away, lamenting our lot.

Please, send back the scent of green fields,  
Send me every little piece of love to save.  
I endure the pain, for loving you means letting go of the leaves from their branches.

Even if tomorrow, your hand is held by another, I’ll be just a sad dream to you,  
Like a fading breeze, my love flows with the river back to its source.

They say Hue men are dreamers,  
I too send you a bit of love wrapped in poetry.  
A little lingering thought to satisfy this longing,  
As the boat sails far from this shore, still waiting,  
Though I know there’s a bond but no fate,  
A thousand miles away, lost in the clouds.

The rain in the capital still seeps into my heart,  
Days apart from your embrace: "Half of my soul is lost."  
I love the poetry of Han Mac Tu because it resonates with this line,  
Yes, aging will bow down to time,  
Life rarely brings joy, only sighs escape our lips.  
I’m no different, holding your shadow until dawn breaks,  
Even in dreams, I still wish to invite you.  
Many advise me to forget,  
Yet when night falls, they’re no different from me.  
Sometimes I sit absent-minded, reminiscing about the past,  
We once were like two joyful birds, dancing and singing on a branch.

And tomorrow, by chance, we might meet at the end of the road, hand in hand,  
And then that day will fade, sorrowful each morning,  
Each line of poetry adds more dreams left for you.

Please, send back the scent of green fields,  
Send me every little piece of love to save.  
I endure the pain, for loving you means letting go of the leaves from their branches.

Even if tomorrow, your hand is held by another, I’ll be just a sad dream to you,  
Like a fading breeze, my love flows with the river back to its source.

Hmm...  
If you love, then say you love,  
If you miss, then say you miss,  
Forget the foolishness,  
These low notes still breathe within me.  
Knowing life is fleeting, why do I remain indifferent?  
Still allowing loneliness to seize moments of joy.  
Hmm... Will that distant person remember?  
Or am I just a fleeting lover?  
The heavens conspired for us to meet by chance,  
Is it fate or debt?  
In the end, it all shatters.

Why make promises of reunion,  
When we’ll drift apart?  
Waiting through a thousand clouds,  
Oh, where are you now, my love?
