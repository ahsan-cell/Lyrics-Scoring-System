**Translated Lyrics:**

Music plays Frank Sinatra, but I don’t need it  
Sorrow rushes in from nowhere, surrounding me  
Exhausted, I’m holding your hand  

You casually walk by the balcony,  
It seems you’re tipsy after a few glasses of wine  
By chance, our lives collide, unfortunately  
You found me at the bottom of the deep  

Nostalgically looking at each other, the cigarette is burning down  
Outside, cars rush by in a hurry  
Many times we’ve come together and parted, regretting in delay  
Now I just wish someone could erase time  

Don’t let the smoke turn the sky into gray  
Don’t make the atmosphere drown us in sorrow  
Don’t let our love die right from the start  
Even if it’s vague, not knowing where we’ll go  

And you gaze with half-closed eyes, lips slightly parted  
Someone makes my heart want to have someone who needs me  
After all the deceit in life  
Love turns out to be unspoken, so  

You immerse yourself in dreams, turning our love into a film  
You, because of a few painful moments, force your heart to stay silent  
As for me, I will always love you  
Just as I have always loved you  
From the very beginning  

I see you exhale a light puff of smoke, splitting the sky in two  
If you don’t come, then who will mend it for a lifetime?  
The red ember on the cigarette falls into the ashtray like a shooting star  
Your soul seems lost among the vast roots surrounding  

I’m sorry for being a bit tipsy, my mind is all hazy  
Thank you for the sorrows that brought my feet to this bar  
I know that if the night ends, it will pull in endless thoughts  
So let’s be happy, let our hearts celebrate  

You close your lashes, free of sorrow, looking at me  
You make me realize I only love you  
After all the deceit in life  
Love turns out to be unspoken, so  

How many people hope their love becomes a film?  
And how many are in pain, forcing their hearts to stay silent?  
As for me, I will always love you  
Just as I have always loved you.
