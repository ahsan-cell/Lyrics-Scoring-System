**Translated Lyrics:**

In a place so unfamiliar,  
Just me and my sorrow,  
No one left beside me... to listen,  
Gone now, yes, we are far apart,  
Why does my heart still feel so lost?

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s been, it’s been so long, so long since my heart spoke,  
Memories forgotten, buried deep in silence,  
Love shattered in two.

[Chorus]  
You, why are you in such a hurry?  
Not even a proper goodbye to anyone,  
So many journeys that won’t return,  
You promised to stay with me, didn’t you?

You, you are the one I have  
Loved so much, I can’t even count how much,  
It’s been so long since you came back,  
A thousand memories still linger.

[Verse 2]  
In a place so unfamiliar,  
Just me and my sorrow,  
No one left beside me, to listen...  
Gone now, yes, we are far apart,  
Why does my heart still cling to you?

[Chorus]  
You, why are you in such a hurry?  
Not even a proper goodbye to anyone,  
So many journeys that won’t return,  
You promised to stay with me, didn’t you?

You, you are the one I have  
Loved so much, I can’t even count how much,  
It’s been so long since you came back,  
A thousand memories still linger.

[Bridge]  
Return to me those peaceful days,  
When we didn’t know each other,  
Return to me every precious moment,  
The days without you.

[Chorus]  
You, why are you in such a hurry?  
Not even a proper goodbye to anyone,  
So many journeys that won’t return,  
You promised to stay with me, didn’t you?

You, you are the one I have  
Loved so much, I can’t even count how much,  
It’s been so long since you came back,  
A thousand memories still linger.

[Ending]  
You have gone, taking my soul with you,  
The world is empty without you...
