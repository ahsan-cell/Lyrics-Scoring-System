**Translated Lyrics:**

Em, the day you dropped your smile into me  
Did you think that later you'd wait?  
And freely give away all your innocence  

Anh, a person who sings of fragile dreams  
Wandering in search of lost joy  
Not even sad enough to tell my heart to forget the loneliness  

[Pre-Chorus]  

We loved each other with memories still wet on the letters  
We were never at fault for not listening to our hearts' refusal  
It's just a pity that  

[Chorus]  

You are not my muse  
And I am no longer the dreamy songwriter  
This love is light as the wind  
Yet it weighs down our hearts with scars  

This love's voice is fragile  
Now shattered, we must accept it  
Putting aside those innocent days  
Returning it all to you...  

[Verse 2]  

Tomorrow, you will forget the day we were foolish  
I hope you keep this memory safe  
I hope your sadness no longer drenches your shoulders  

Tomorrow, when you stride through life so wide  
Just remember one thing  
There was someone who once loved you deeply and endlessly  

[Chorus]  

You are not my muse  
And I am no longer the dreamy songwriter  
This love is light as the wind  
Yet it weighs down our hearts with scars  

This love's voice is fragile  
Now shattered, we must accept it  
Putting aside those innocent days  
Returning it all to you  

You are not my muse  
And I am no longer the dreamy songwriter  
This love is light as the wind  
Yet it weighs down our hearts with scars  
This love's voice is fragile  
Now shattered, we must accept it  
Putting aside those innocent days  
Returning it all to you
