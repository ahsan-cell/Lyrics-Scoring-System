**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s you, because of you  
You’ve shown me love and care  
But why is it so cruel, you are the wind  
Gliding by quickly, leaving me with dew to bear  
A beautiful flower in this song I share  

So that one day, when your heart can truly hear  
You’ll see yourself stumbling,  
What courage will it take for me to wrap you near?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s too hard to care for a girl like you  
To find warmth and happiness until life is through  
Because of poverty,  
Indeed, everyone feels this way too  
No one chooses to hold someone’s hand  
While forgetting the struggles right at hand  

[Chorus]  
Is it because I’m foolish or did you love too fast?  
For the sake of our future, you’re paying debts from the past  
A tender rose, your shoulders bear so much weight  
Now carrying more sorrow from someone so cold-hearted  

Who do you want to call out in the dark night’s despair?  
What are you searching for at the bottom of that bitter drink there?  
Night after night, crying alone, serving meals and pouring drinks for your man  
How can I forget and stop waiting, as you let go of everything in your heart?  

It’s you, because of you  
You’ve shown me love and care  
But why is it so cruel, you are the wind  
Gliding by quickly, leaving me with dew to bear  
A beautiful flower in this song I share  

So that one day, when your heart can truly hear  
You’ll see yourself stumbling,  
What courage will it take for me to wrap you near?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s too hard to care for a girl like you  
To find warmth and happiness until life is through  
Because of poverty,  
Indeed, everyone feels this way too  
No one chooses to hold someone’s hand  
While forgetting the struggles right at hand  

[Chorus]  
Is it because I’m foolish or did you love too fast?  
For the sake of our future, you’re paying debts from the past  
A tender rose, your shoulders bear so much weight  
Now carrying more sorrow from someone so cold-hearted  

Who do you want to call out in the dark night’s despair?  
What are you searching for at the bottom of that bitter drink there?  
Night after night, crying alone, serving meals and pouring drinks for your man  
How can I forget and stop waiting, as you let go of everything in your heart?
