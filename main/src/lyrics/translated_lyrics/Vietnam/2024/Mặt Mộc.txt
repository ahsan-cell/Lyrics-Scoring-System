**[Intro]**
Hey, homie  
This is the last track  
Lil CC, let’s go  
You’re done for, kid

**[Verse 1]**  
From the intro, you already failed, your track is just made-up facts,  
Who gave you info like a pile of crap? You quickly gobbled it up.  
If you want facts, then do your homework, look into what’s before and after,  
The one with the skills is me, your facts are fake, so your head gets stripped bare.  
Yeah, I grab your hair, the show begins,  
You brag about being a killer, but when you see my Facebook, you shake your head.  
You flaunt your achievements from when you dissed, trying to prove something,  
Two years ago, your crew saw a mad dog barking wildly.  
You say my music lacks skill, but that’s you,  
It’s too hard for you to think of a line with any skill, that’s true.  
At that level, let me show you, while you’re just this little,  
If you don’t get it, come here, I’ll print “skill” in big letters for you.  
I get high on the flow and pronounce it right, Vigga,  
You’re getting slapped because it hurts, and your tongue’s tied, Vigga.  
You should’ve suffered when your mom was pregnant, Vigga,  
Your flow is choked like your mom struggling to pee, Vigga.

**[Intro 2]**  
So now, if you know something, speak up; if not, stay quiet, kid.  
Fake killer outside, silent as a knife,  
If that were true, you wouldn’t be able to join the army, kid.  
You crazy fool.

**[Verse 2]**  
You thought catchy music meant you’d win, huh?  
Your name is based on a gun, but without bullets, how can you shoot back?  
I throw you a few bars so you know where you stand,  
If you want to lick my boots, you need to step up your game.  
Learn to write meaningful lyrics, don’t just capitalize nonsense, got it?  
You claim to be a big tree, but this line is an example.  
Just like your life, it needs to have meaning,  
And if your logic is weak, don’t make noise.  
It’s exactly how you rap that makes your products all leftovers.  
Don’t think just because you’re from the West, you’re the best,  
Your crew sees me as trash.  
You think this loser has youth,  
But you’re just breaking necks of chickens, that’s a bust.  
Oh, how’s your lyric? You wrote it yourself, that’s frustrating.  
The soldier rapper puffs his chest proudly while eating trash.  
All the words you stuff in show how much you care,  
You’re a tough guy in rap, but when you meet me, you’re just a coward.  
If I compare you to a clam, I’m in love with your silence,  
Because your skills are so light, I don’t need to weigh them.  
Proud to call myself a soldier protecting my family, Bizzon?  
You’re not the only soldier out there; there are plenty more, Bizzon.  
I’m not some lapdog to serve and bark like that, Bizzon.  
I pay taxes and rent every month to fund your salary, Bizzon.  
And surely, your tiny skills aren’t even worth a hair from my armpit.  
Body bagged, and I still waste time like this, it’s called style.  
If this match were basketball, open your eyes and see,  
I drop this track in your head just like LeBron James.  
I’m still ruthless, body bagging you, Mac; when you meet me, you should run away.  
There’s hardly any other way; keep your mouth shut and don’t brag.  
From the West, but you’re not genuine at all.  
Talk nonsense, and you’ll get slapped; I’ll clean you up like trash.  
And fuck this clueless kid, erase your Mac, you’re a rapper.  
I’ll hit you with my flow, enough to send you to the hospital,  
Make you quit like those junkies, Faker.  
Yeah, that’s impressive, Vigga,  
Auto-tune is top-notch, Vigga.  
Your hook would be great if NT from LVR featured it, Vigga.  
Let’s take you back two years to your peak, homeboy.  
Even if you were at the highest point, I wouldn’t be scared
