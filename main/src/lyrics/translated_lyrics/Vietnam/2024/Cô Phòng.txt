**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**
So many bad things, theoretically not wrong,  
Whispers hide, words that sound truly off.  
Electricity bill's due, but the month's still long,  
We haven't even spent it yet, how to make it public?  
In hand, thorns and thistles, future, I wonder if I can hold on?  
People come and go, my heart remains indifferent.  
The world spins wildly, don’t expect paradise.  
Sad words build up, releasing everything into the air,  
Quiet for a moment, a sunny day greets the winter.  
Waiting is a waste of energy, why be foolish for nothing?  
I just want to wander, strumming my guitar,  
All night lost in music, holding my instrument tight.  
What remains in ruins, nine people, ten sweet whispers in my ear,  
Brothers compete over every card dealt,  
Youthful passion with those years in every audience.  
What can we say? A man’s life is full of wandering,  
Sitting watching the sunset far away, seeds sprouting flowers.  
Deceit from within,  
Instead of looking back at myself,  
Missing someone who doesn’t visit,  
Light and darkness merge, drowning endlessly.  
A bit of regret, past efforts, closing my eyes, hoping to see dawn,  
Ahead, a deadlock, a glimmer of warm sunlight, that’s all the faith I have.  
Step forward, seize it, willpower, strive, desire, so life remains silent.  
Today and tomorrow, many long lonely nights, I must love myself.

**[Verse 2: Xám]**  
Every night I still embrace the dream of holding the mic, rapping before hundreds of thousands,  
I must stand up, there’s nothing to fear, I need those radiant years.  
I bring this emotional color, still forever young, hip-hop from the house on Trần Phú street,  
Still that poor neighborhood near the market, though rap sounds like magic to them.  
Let me talk about where I grew up, the girl doesn’t care for me,  
You must stop and look clearly at yourself in the mirror.  
To have language in your head but not know how to speak,  
No pretentiousness, just call it the wild winds.  
Because my life and yours sometimes feel chaotic,  
Still rapping, though many say it’s nonsense.  
Many say you’re not normal, and only I dare to say I am brave.

There are days, hours, feelings I’m too lazy to write down,  
But in the end, I still want to apologize or thank everyone who passed by.  
No matter who you are and who I am, we’re still brothers,  
Even if tomorrow you can’t live, don’t think too much, just smile.

**[Verse 3: Khán]**  
The joyful days count on my fingers,  
While the sadness is countless.  
Letting my soul rise like a spinning top, dizzy, thinking life isn’t that bad.  
A lifetime feels like a fleeting dream, a 20-year-long sleepwalk.  
Reflecting on how long this life is, why must we always rush?  
Live as if unbound, live fully even if tomorrow is the end.  
Every game will eventually end, but the bright smile remains when leaving.  
Sincerity and honesty are treasures, unlike gold and silver you can weigh.  
To receive, you must learn to give, feeling at peace when there’s no envy inside.  
I’m like a wild wave, sometimes fierce, sometimes subdued,  
Like a bird trapped in a cage, freedom is what it needs most.  
It’s pain that never fades, accompanied by sweet judgments,  
No one blames the heavens, just raising a middle finger because life is frustrating.

**[Verse 4: Dickator]**  
Hip-hop in my heart flows like blood,  
On stage, on the mic, participating in a few rounds.  
Not caring, ignoring the laughter and scorn,  
At least in Vietnamese rap, there will be a few who are passionate.

Starting again with the hit “The Girl Who Cut Her Hair,”  
Then freestyle a track called “Crying.”  
With my brothers and homies, reaching the peak of Lang Bian,  
Brothers, you have talent, but we don’t have any haters.

Raise your hand, and I’ll make your head nod,  
What I play every day, simply called Vegetation.  
Not sick, so no sneezing,  
Shout out to the South and shout out to the North.

Let me introduce myself, I’m not lacking in love,  
I’m Huỳnh Công Hiếu, broadcasted on TV.  
Sometimes rhyming and praising myself for being good,
