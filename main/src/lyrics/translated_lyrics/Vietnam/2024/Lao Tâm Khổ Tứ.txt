**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1:**
Once there was Saint Gióng, who bravely fought to rid us of foes,  
Only using bamboo to battle, making many nod in prose.  
Not caring for glory or wealth, fame is just mundane,  
With a heart devoted, sacrificing blood for our nation's gain.  
Now in the fight, the doctors and soldiers stand tall,  
Diving into the epicenter, forgetting themselves for all.  
Treating with flexible plans, preparing step by step,  
Acting from the heart, never saying "no" with regret.  

Always fighting day and night without a pause,  
Not knowing when this battle will come to a cause.  
We can't take Corona lightly,  
These days are hanging tightly.  
For the happiness of every home,  
Bravely facing every trial we comb.  
A steadfast belief always burns within,  
Like Saint Gióng of old,  
We are the descendants of Vietnam.  

**Hook:**  
WOW WOW  
Together we must not be careless, always wear a mask,  
We are the descendants of Vietnam, eyyyyy.  
Always remember to keep your distance,  
Wash your hands clean with Lifebuoy's assistance.  
Raise your hands and Wash Wash Wash Wash Wash,  
Wash Wash,  
X4  
We are the descendants of Vietnam.  

**Verse 2:**  
Joining hands to fight for our strong nation,  
Keep a distance of two meters when meeting friends on the station.  
Medical masks are our constant, irreplaceable shield,  
No division by gender, we all stand in the field.  
From the city to the countryside, Lifebuoy is always near,  
Frontline doctors hope for victory to bring them cheer.  
Everyone is the same, and everyone is like each other,  
The spirit of fighting the pandemic is like fighting a brother.  
Determined to push through, facing challenges ahead,  
Always fighting day and night without dread.  
We can't take Corona lightly,  
These days are hanging tightly.  
For the happiness of every home,  
Bravely facing every trial we comb.  
A steadfast belief always burns within,  
Like Saint Gióng of old,  
We are the descendants of Vietnam.  

**Hook:**  
WOW WOW  
Together we must not be careless, always wear a mask,  
We are the descendants of Vietnam, eyyyyy.  
Always remember to keep your distance,  
Wash your hands clean with Lifebuoy's assistance.  
Raise your hands and Wash Wash Wash Wash Wash,  
Wash Wash,  
X4  
We are the descendants of Vietnam.
