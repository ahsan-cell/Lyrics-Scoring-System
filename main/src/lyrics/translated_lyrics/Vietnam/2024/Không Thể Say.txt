**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kewtiie]  
(Hey, Kewtiie)

[Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
It's been over a year now, yet you still regret us,  
Erasing every tattoo on my skin, our love can't fade away.  
It's been a while since I wanted to get drunk,  
But today, I find myself thinking of you again.  
Maybe I'll call you and say, "I still love you,"  
Ring your doorbell at night, knowing there are a thousand things I shouldn't.  
I promise in my heart I won't drink anymore,  
Because you're the number one reason I can't get drunk.

[Verse 1: HIEUTHUHAI]  
I'm still trying to forget the days we lay side by side,  
Gaining success or making more money,  
Being known by many won't bring me a smile anymore (no, no, no).  
Because behind the lights, there's no one beside me,  
And I've tried to love more, even though I know it's wrong.  
Perhaps I can't love again,  
Now every notification I hope for is from you.

[Pre-Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
Wet on my lashes,  
Every time I pass the places where we walked.  
Where has our love gone when it means nothing?  
Drinking more is just because my tears fall into the glass.  
We weren't wrong,  
But how can I get you back now?  
What good are the house and car if I'm always waiting for you?  
Staying up all night, wanting you by my side, I need another bottle.

[Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
It's been over a year now, yet you still regret us,  
Erasing every tattoo on my skin, our love can't fade away.  
It's been a while since I wanted to get drunk,  
But today, I find myself thinking of you again.  
Maybe I'll call you and say, "I still love you,"  
Ring your doorbell at night, knowing there are a thousand things I shouldn't.  
I promise in my heart I won't drink anymore,  
Because you're the number one reason I can't get drunk.

[Verse 2: HIEUTHUHAI]  
I know for sure we can't meet again on this life's road,  
And I just wish that someday you'll meet someone wonderful.  
I'll keep moving on, not hurting the next person as much as I hurt you,  
Because I've seen you in pain, crying when we fought.  
I can't sleep at all,  
And with swollen eyes the next day, I can't hold on any longer.  
Just keep your tears for yourself.

[Pre-Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
Wet on my lashes,  
Every time I pass the places where we walked.  
Where has our love gone when it means nothing?  
Drinking more is just because my tears fall into the glass.  
We weren't wrong,  
But how can I get you back now?  
What good are the house and car if I'm always waiting for you?  
Staying up all night, wanting you by my side, I need another bottle.

[Bridge: HIEUTHUHAI]  
We promised so many things, yet we're not together now.  
I don't know how long you cried when we said goodbye.  
Back then, I didn't have the courage to look back,  
Trying so hard, yet we drifted apart forever.

[Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
It's been over a year now, yet you still regret us,  
Erasing every tattoo on my skin, our love can't fade away.  
It's been a while since I wanted to get drunk,  
But today, I find myself thinking of you again.  
Maybe I'll call you and say, "I still love you,"  
Ring your doorbell at night, knowing there are a thousand things I shouldn't.  
I promise in my heart I won't drink anymore,  
Because you're the number one reason I can't get drunk.
