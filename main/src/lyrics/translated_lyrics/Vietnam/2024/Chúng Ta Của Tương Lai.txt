**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Will tomorrow fade away, not walking side by side? (Not walking side by side, side by side)  
Then will we feel pain? (Then will we feel pain? Feel pain?)  
Whose tears will dry?  
Who will come to wipe away this pain?

Turning away, indifferent, are we really so cold and distant? (So distant? So distant?)  
Pretending we don’t know each other (Don’t know each other, don’t know each other)  
Silently passing by without a word (Passing by without a word)  
Ooh-whoa-ooh-whoa-oh-oh-oh (Yeah, eh)

[Pre-Chorus]  
Will the pain be forgotten quickly? (Hah-ah-ooh-ah)  
Or the more we forget, the more we cling to the heartache, the sorrowful wound? (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
Don’t act like a child (like a child), once so passionately in love (Oh-oh-ah)  
Why is it that when we part (when we part), we become so strangely unfamiliar? (We become so strangely unfamiliar)

[Chorus]  
Who dares to say what the future holds? (What the future holds)  
No one knows what tomorrow will bring (Tomorrow will bring)  
Love doesn’t know if it will remain intact  
Just as we promised before? (Just as we promised before)

Even if storms push us apart (Push us apart)  
The beautiful memories of a passionate time will last forever (A passionate time)  
The smiles and the tears we shared together  
Looking back towards the sun (Towards the sun)  
(We look towards the sun, towards the sun, towards the sun)

[Verse 2]  
Yah, yah  
Who knows what tomorrow will bring? (Woah)  
Love and then let go of each other's hands (Woah)  
Fragile fate like a stroke of luck  
Parting and reuniting faster than clouds in the sky (Yah)

Forgetting each other, pretending we never met (Why forget?)  
Forgetting faces, forgetting names (Why forget?)  
How can we demand to forget?  
When the old vows still remain intact, so don’t try to forget (Ah)

Lingering isn’t so bad (woah), missing isn’t so bad (woah)  
Pain isn’t so bad (Woah)  
Even if it’s bitter, we’ll be okay  
Being sincere while together and cherishing every moment (Cherishing every moment)  
Being honest with each other every moment (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]  
Will the pain be forgotten quickly? (Hah-ah-ooh-ah)  
Or the more we forget, the more we cling to the heartache, the sorrowful wound? (Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
Don’t act like a child (like a child), once so passionately in love (Oh-oh-ah)  
Why is it that when we part (when we part), we become so strangely unfamiliar? (We become so strangely unfamiliar, hah)

[Chorus]  
Who dares to say what the future holds? (What the future holds)  
No one knows what tomorrow will bring (Tomorrow will bring)  
Love doesn’t know if it will remain intact  
Just as we promised before? (Just as we promised before)  
Even if storms push us apart (Push us apart)  
The beautiful memories of a passionate time will last forever (A passionate time)  
The smiles and the tears we shared together  
Looking back towards the sun (Towards the sun)

[Bridge]  
Who dares to say what the future holds?  
No one knows what the future will bring (What the future will bring, what the future will bring)  
Love doesn’t know if it will remain intact just as we promised before?

Even if storms push us apart  
Even if tempests separate us (Even if tempests separate us)  
The smiles and the tears we shared  
To gift you a dream, y-yah, y-yah (Y-yah, y-yah, hah)

[Chorus]  
Who dares to say what the future holds? (Living together)  
No one knows what tomorrow will bring (Living together)  
Love doesn’t know if it will remain intact  
Just as we promised before? (Just as we promised before)

Even if storms push us apart (Keep that love)  
The beautiful memories of a passionate time will last forever (Keep that love)  
The smiles and the tears we shared together  
Looking back towards the sun (The sun)

[Outro]  
We look towards the sun (towards the sun, towards the sun, towards the sun)
