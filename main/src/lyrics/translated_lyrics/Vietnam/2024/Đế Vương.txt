---

You’re in this mess because you chose it,  
This chaos you created, the community won’t clean it up for you.  
You pushed down the one called “bro,” no lesson was ever sincere,  
Now think about your life, no one escapes the law of karma.  
Right? Don’t drag my brothers into this as a sacrifice.  
If you heartlessly push someone else down, someone will come to push you back.  

I respect your music, the way you write and flow,  
Looking at that message, honestly, I don’t blame you.  
It’s just that I see you chose the wrong crew,  
Chose the wrong guys who share the same mindset, drinking late at night.  
Betrayal is still wrong, no matter how you try to justify it,  
But when these feet stumble and fall, no brother will plot against you.  

Ah, this life is nothing but cruel.  
As long as there’s money, there are brothers; when the drinks run out, so do the friends.  
Arrogance will kill you, adding to your own sins.  
Whether intentional or out of control, using harsh words against those who once lifted you up.  
Calm down to keep this heart truly quiet,  
Your true nature is hard to judge through a text message.  

It lies deep within your thoughts,  
And you can’t conclude who’s good, as many speak sweetly but think otherwise.  
So let’s just move on and leave it be.  
Many say you live dirty, but when they get home, they curse their parents.  
The venomous words in our heads are often deeply engraved,  
Compared to the spoken words, there’s really no difference.  

I don’t like preaching, don’t want to sugarcoat, just act gently.  
When texting my friends, sometimes I still curse that guy.  
The difference is I’m not leaking inboxes, putting myself in an awkward position.  
Simply, I have a few brothers, but they’re all quality.  
You can’t have that if you rely on your own strength.  
There are dozens on the field, if you fall, they just want to kick you.  

But maybe I’m wrong in this comparison that’s getting old.  
If you’re not good enough, how can you find those on the same frequency?  
Educated people meet educated people, wealthy meet wealthy,  
While those with a rotten core only meet other troublesome souls.  
Music is music, and life is life; you can’t deny a rap talent.  
Those brothers won’t turn their backs on you because they fear your knife.  

Regret over the words, over those you’ve gotten close to,  
A warrior undefeated, a fool if you show your weak spot.  
That crazy kid living on the edge is just fate,  
So if you don’t run and die, don’t turn around to curse your father.  
And that’s my viewpoint; no matter what, I’ll still speak, even if the wicked curse me.  
Just keep moving forward; a man works and receives.  
Don’t let this life drift away, leaving everything to fate.  

And I don’t need to kill you for everything to feel more surreal,  
Because my life is a different definition of perfection.  
With parents, loved ones, and education, I’ve earned that.  
With money and a million-dollar house in the city center.  
Proud of my brothers, no need to roll a joint and sit up all night.  
Sometimes provoked, when my ego gets triggered, after a fight, we resolve all conflicts.  
Hoang, that’s something you don’t have.  
My life is calm, while yours is full of storms.  
Those brothers, when you were on top, lifted you high,  
But when you fall from grace, where are my brothers then?
