**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Is there any regret, my dear?  
Are you feeling joy or sadness about the memories of our outings?  
You don’t know that I’ve wandered into a love where right and wrong are unclear.  

There will be times you feel lost,  
Are you searching for love, or does it come to you on its own?  
Could that person be me? I just want you to follow your heart.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, let me tell you about a new love,  
It’s only me.  
Baby, let me tell you about a new love,  
It’s only me.  

[Chorus]  
Just pretend we never met, you can go, but don’t forget  
That love is still overflowing, if only you were here (whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh).  
Just pretend we never met, you can go, but don’t forget  
That there’s so much left in me, if only you were here, yeah, yeah.  

[Verse 2]  
On a Monday night, I thought you were coming back,  
Because you’ve captured this heart, making no one else want it.  
On a Monday night, the last time you looked at me with longing,  
It was when we struggled to say we didn’t want to go home, woah-oh-oh.  
Every morning when I wake up, I step out on the balcony, humming a gentle tune.  
You love hip-hop, passionate about the guy, swaying in perfect rhythm.  
If you like the way we dance together, then one thing I know is you’re feeling unsure.  
And the truth is, you feel okay when I hold you close.  

Looking at you, I’m confused,  
I’ve lost, your heart has many paths.  
I’ve never dared to say I love anyone like this.  

[Chorus]  
Just pretend we never met, you can go, but don’t forget  
That love is still overflowing, if only you were here (no-oh-oh-whoo).  
Has anyone ever told you that you’re like a fairy, lost in a world that dispels peace?  
Don’t make me weary, thinking of you every second, yeah, eh.  

[Outro]  
Has anyone ever told you that you’re like a fairy, lost in a world that dispels peace?  
Don’t make me weary, thinking of you every second, yeah, eh.  

Looking at you, I’m confused,  
I’ve lost, your heart has many paths.  
I’ve never dared to say I love anyone like this.
