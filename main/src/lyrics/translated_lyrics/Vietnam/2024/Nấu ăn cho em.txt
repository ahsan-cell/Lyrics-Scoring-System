**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: PiaLinh, Đen]**  
Look at the clouds, clouds at head height  
Look at the mountains, mountains rising and falling  
With you on this path  
A tiny winding road  
Crossing over the hills  
I see you smiling gently in your round eyes  
And the world tilts with your little feet (Yeah yeah)  

**[Verse 1: Đen]**  
The kids walk to school, with white clouds on their heads (White)  
Feet stepping on the sun, lips smiling, cheeks kissed by sunlight (Sunlight)  
Those smiles make my busy heart suddenly feel at ease  
Up here seeing you all, I realize how lucky I am (So lucky)  
The sun is golden like a fried egg  
When you stand tall, the mountains and hills must lean (Yeah)  
The winding road, you swirl like a bird in flight  
In the future, as you grow, you'll swim through life, strong like Ánh Viên (Haha)  
Even though I'm no longer a student, I still feel I have much to learn  
Like a tree growing from the earth, it needs nutrients to branch out (Ooh)  
Learning to nurture happiness so that branches bear good things  
Because I believe fate is a watcher, not a controller (Not a controller)  
So I hope you all will never give up (No)  
Because I know you may be small, but your courage can never be small (That's right)  
Yo, it can never be small  
Yo, it can never be small (Uh)  

**[Chorus: PiaLinh, Đen]**  
Look at the clouds, clouds at head height (Oh look at the clouds)  
Look at the mountains, mountains rising and falling (Oh look at the mountains)  
With you on this path (With you)  
A tiny winding road (Winding, winding)  
Crossing over the hills (Far away)  
I see you smiling gently in your round eyes (Round and bright)  
And the world tilts with your little feet (Yeah)  

**[Verse 2: Đen]**  
Cooking for you all even though I'm not a great chef (Hehe)  
It's also a way for me to ease my mind and stop it from getting tired (Ooh)  
I want to see the little guests finish every delicious dish  
Because I know these kids will build our homeland one day (That's right)  
Cooking for you all, you gather strength to pick up each letter (Pick up each letter)  
With knowledge, you see the tiger no longer fierce (Not fierce)  
And you will grow taller than the plum tree in the garden (Ooh)  
At that time, the deep crevices will just be extra strokes in a painting (Haha)  
We want to become good people and are learning to do just that (Yeah)  
We look at you to know what we need and what we have (Ooh)  
We were once children too, needing to fill our bellies by evening (Oh)  
We practice finding ways to give because we know giving brings back much (Brings back much)  
Because giving smiles, worries will drift far away (Drift far away)  
Giving happiness will return double or triple, yo (Double or triple)  
Giving happiness will return double or triple  
Double or triple (Yeah)  

**[Bridge: PiaLinh]**  
In those eyes, you see the sky, you see the mountains and hills, the clear lake  
Hoping your feet will be strong and the stones always soft on every path you take  
The sun in your pink heart, echoing a rooster's call at noon  
Wishing for the trees to sprout leaves, hoping for gentle winds and harmonious rains  

**[Chorus: PiaLinh]**  
Look at the clouds, clouds at head height  
Look at the mountains, mountains rising and falling (Ah-ah-ah)  
With you on this path (Ah)  
A tiny winding road (Ah-ah)  
Crossing over the hills  
I see you smiling gently in your round eyes  
And the world tilts with your little feet (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah)  

**[Outro: Đen]**  
Down below, we call this view a million-dollar view  
So who is truly affluent?  
We work and work and work just hoping for a day of leisure  
And when looking back at these images, the pressures suddenly fade away  
Those smiles cool like spring water  
And those eyes clear as the source of light  
We all have to learn to improve day by day  
At first, no one is good right away  
Because we don’t know what to do  
So we watch the good people around us, see what they do and follow  
And there are many good people out
