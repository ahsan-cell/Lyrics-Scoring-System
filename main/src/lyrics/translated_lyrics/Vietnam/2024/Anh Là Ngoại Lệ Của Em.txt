**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
And I’ve realized I can’t love anyone else but you  
My heart has no room left to save for anyone else but you  
The door to my heart, here’s the key, I only want you to hold it  
More than just a crush, now I’m in love, oh

[Verse 1]  
Oh, it turns out I’m really small  
Fitting perfectly in your embrace, as if I’m holding the whole world  
Oh, it turns out I’m not that strong (not at all)  
It’s just that no one before you made me feel safe enough to be weak

[Pre-Chorus]  
The way you always care so patiently  
Makes all my doubts just fly away  
The way you’re always warm and gentle  
So soft yet enough to melt the ice  
Even my strictness, I never expected  
All the rules I set are just for you to break  
In the end, I have no strength left to resist

[Chorus]  
And I’ve realized I can’t love anyone else but you  
My heart has no room left to save for anyone else but you  
The door to my heart, here’s the key, I only want you to hold it  
More than just a crush, now I’m in love, oh  

[Post-Chorus]  
Because baby, you are  
Lalalala lalalala my exception  
Lalalala, because you are my exception  
Lalalala lalalala my exception  
Lalalala, because you are my exception  

[Verse 2]  
Oh, why have I softened my heart? (Oh no)  
All my defenses have gone down (Sigh)  
But it’s okay, I still have one thing to remind you first (Remember)  
My heart isn’t made of glass, but it’s fragile just the same  
I hope you’ll take care, don’t just make me long for you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The way you always care so patiently  
Makes all my doubts just fly away  
The way you’re always warm and gentle  
So soft yet enough to melt the ice  
Even my strictness, I never expected  
All the rules I set are just for you to break  
In the end, I have no strength left to resist  

[Chorus]  
And I’ve realized I can’t love anyone else but you  
My heart has no room left to save for anyone else but you  
The door to my heart, here’s the key, I only want you to hold it  
More than just a crush, now I’m in love, oh  

[Post-Chorus]  
Because baby, you are  
Lalalala lalalala my exception  
Lalalala, because you are my exception  
Lalalala lalalala my exception  
Lalalala, because you are my exception  

[Outro]  
You are, you are, you are  
You are, you are  
Because you are my exception  
You are, you are, you are  
La la la la  
(Because you are) my exception, I swear it’s true
