**Translated Lyrics:**

Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah  
Hah-hah-hah-hah-hah  
Hah-huh  
Hah-huh, oh  

[Verse]  
Turns out I just went to pick some flowers  
But unfortunately, this hand is bleeding now  
There are thorns, there are thorns, a thorn has pricked  
My finger, my finger on the bruise  
Still don't know why?  
(Hah-hah-hah) Again saying goodbye  
(Hah-hah-hah) Bye  
Why?  

[Chorus]  
Don't say "goodbye"  
Honestly, it feels so wrong  
Who can be "good" when you keep rolling along?  
Is there a time we say farewell but still feel "good"?  
Why say goodbye? And I still wonder why?  
Why goodbye? When no one feels at ease?  
Though we both know no one wavers in what’s decreed  
Is there a time we say farewell but still feel "good"?  
Why do we say goodbye? It feels so off  
Oh, it's a badbye  

[Interlude]  
It's so bad  
It's so bad  
It's so bad  
Hahaha  
It's so bad  
It's so bad  
Hahaha  

[Bridge]  
I say  
In the bright pine garden  
The path in the shade  
We hold a hybrid rose  
A rose should have a "guy"  
A "guy," a "guy," the flower has a "guy"  
Is there anyone, anyone who lost their card?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I still don't know why  
(Yeah yeah yeah) Again saying goodbye  
(Yeah yeah yeah) Why?  
(Yeah yeah yeah) Why?  
(Goodbye)  

[Chorus]  
Don't say "goodbye"  
Honestly, it feels so wrong  
Who can be "good" when you keep rolling along?  
Is there a time we say farewell but still feel "good"?  
Why say goodbye? And I still wonder why?  
Why goodbye? When no one feels at ease?  
Though we both know no one wavers in what’s decreed  
Is there a time we say farewell but still feel "good"?  
Why do we say "goodbye"? It feels so off  
Oh, it's a badbye  

[Outro]  
Oh, it's a badbye  
(It's a badbye) Oh, it's a badbye  
Goodbye  
I'm sorry, oh, it's a badbye
