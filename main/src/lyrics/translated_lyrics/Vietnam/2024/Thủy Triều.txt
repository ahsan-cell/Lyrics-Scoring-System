**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Close your eyes, kiss my ear  
I can't help but remember you, my dear  
Entwined like waves that gently sway  
I am the wind, you are the tide at play  
Blindfolded, you can't see, no way  
Tonight, who do you need to stay?  
Finish the glass of wine in your hand  
We float like we're lost in a dreamland  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, I don’t want this, I don’t want it to be just a dream  
(La-la-la) In the night  
Oh, I don’t want this, I don’t want to keep waiting it seems  
(A-a) For so long  
This love that's burning must be hidden away for how long, I’m  
(La-la-la) Searching  
Wrapped in the seductive song that takes the throne  

[Chorus]  
I give you my love, all of it, just for you  
Lost in the sky, just us two in a dreamy view  
Eyes closed, hands intertwined, drowning in memories anew  
Missing you, even when you're by my side, I love you more, a-a-a  

[Verse 2]  
M-m-m-m-m-your eyes and lips, I sink so deep  
Listening closer when our bodies meet  
The moon visits, the tide rises high  
We wish tonight will never say goodbye  
I love you, my dear, I’m mesmerized  
You make me feel like a poet, so surprised  
Your lips have a scent that’s so unique  
I want to kiss you just a little more, so sweet  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t want this, I don’t want it to be just a dream  
(La-la-la) In the night  
Oh, I don’t want this, I don’t want to keep waiting it seems  
(A-a, a-a) For so long  
This love that's burning must be hidden away for how long, I’m  
(La-la-la) Searching  
Wrapped in the seductive song that takes the throne  

[Chorus]  
I give you my love, all of it, just for you  
Lost in the sky, just us two in a dreamy view  
Eyes closed, hands intertwined, drowning in memories anew  
Missing you, even when you're by my side, I love you more  
I give you my love, all of it, just for you  
Lost in the sky, just us two in a dreamy view (A-a, a-a, a-a)  
Eyes closed, hands intertwined, drowning in memories anew  
Missing you, even when you're by my side, I love you more, a-a-a
