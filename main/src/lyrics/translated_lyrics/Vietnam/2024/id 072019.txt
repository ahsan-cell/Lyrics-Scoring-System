**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: W/N]  
Is there a rain we both walked through?  
You came to me on the day we had to part.  
The autumn leaves fall by the lake, and loneliness grows.

That autumn, you were no longer by my side.  
I still stand here waiting for you in the rain.  
We, in the future, won’t be the “us” we are now.

[Chorus: W/n & Titie]  
One person silently stands in the rain watching you,  
One person in the city still waits for you.  
Why?  
Where is the sunlight now, shining down on that place?

At this moment, only memories keep piling up,  
At this moment, it’s just us with these long years.  
Maybe you no longer love me,  
Like our hearts once walked the same path.

[Rap: Nâu]  
I take a round through the town on the old road we used to walk,  
The wheels keep turning, two paths going opposite ways.  
You’ve probably forgotten this street by now, as the jasmine flowers drift away.  
You’re just like the old me, those two roads home now dark.

I still remember when we went to school, you behind me when class ended.  
When you were sad, I’d tease you, telling you to smile, sharing stories together.  
Then we’d go to the café, buy what you liked, your smile would make me happy too.  
But back then was still back then; I thank you for leaving me those days of love.

[Chorus: W/n & Titie]  
One person silently stands in the rain watching you,  
One person in the city still waits for you.  
Why do I stay there?  
Where have you gone?

At this moment, only memories keep piling up,  
At this moment, it’s just us with these long years.  
Maybe you no longer love me,  
Like our hearts once walked the same path.

[Instrumental]

[Outro: Titie]  
Is there a rain we both walked through?  
I write you a song of distant love.  
The autumn leaves fall by the lake, and loneliness grows.

That autumn, I was no longer by your side.  
You still stand here waiting for me in the rain.  
We, in the future, won’t be the “us” we are now.
