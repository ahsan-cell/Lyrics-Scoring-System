**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Văn Mai Hương]  
Outside, the rain falls in June  
Inside, my heart bleeds  
Knowing that we’ve lost each other  
I want to go with you to the place of bright days  
But how can your heart bear to part?  
Outside, the rain falls in June  
Inside, my heart bleeds  
The ruins of pain remain  
I want to walk until we say goodbye  
But love, how often does it truly come by?

[Verse 1: Văn Mai Hương]  
I thought love would last forever  
If we didn’t deceive each other  
But who knew that a tree would wither  
When there’s no one to cherish and nurture it?  
In an instant, clouds turn into rain  
I wonder if this is really the end?  
Or are we still holding onto that pain?  
Holding onto hope, wishing it could become a breeze

[Pre-Chorus: Văn Mai Hương]  
To let the clouds drift away so the rain won’t fall  
But the sky is darkening  
The long road wears me down  
In these years, I never got to say

[Chorus: Văn Mai Hương]  
Outside, the rain falls in June  
Inside, my heart bleeds  
Knowing that we’ve lost each other  
I want to go with you to the place of bright days  
But how can your heart bear to part?  
Outside, the rain falls in June  
Inside, my heart bleeds  
The ruins of pain remain  
I want to walk until we say goodbye  
But love, how often does it truly come by?

[Verse 2: Grey D]  
If I try to walk through the rain  
The sun will surely come, my dear  
Perhaps you’re not my sunshine  
To give me hope  
Maybe I’m just not good enough  
Sometimes I feel suffocated  
By the words  
And the habits that repeat over the years  
We bind ourselves  
Tied to each other  
When neither of us has learned how to let go

[Pre-Chorus: Văn Mai Hương]  
To let the clouds drift away so the rain won’t fall  
But the sky is darkening  
The long road wears me down  
In these years, I never got to say

[Chorus: Văn Mai Hương]  
Outside, the rain falls in June  
Inside, my heart bleeds  
Knowing that we’ve lost each other  
I want to go with you to the place of bright days  
But how can your heart bear to part?  
Outside, the rain falls in June  
Inside, my heart bleeds  
The ruins of pain remain  
I want to walk until we say goodbye  
But love, how often does it truly come by?

[Post-Chorus: Văn Mai Hương]  
Though I’ve tried to forget the past  
But wanting to forget doesn’t mean I will  
Those wounds always linger here  
I just pretend I don’t see them  
June rain, my heart bleeds  
The ruins of pain remain  
I want to walk until we say goodbye  
But love, how often does it truly come by?

[Outro: Văn Mai Hương, Trung Quân]  
June rain, sad rain in June  
I wait for June, I long for June  
I resent June, I’m angry at June  
Why does love hurt me so?  
June rain, sad rain in June  
I know we’ve lost each other  
After the rain, the sun will return  
Who knows, maybe a rainbow will be by my side
