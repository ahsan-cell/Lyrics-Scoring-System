**Translated Lyrics:**

I cut away the shadow of you that I've carried for so long...  
The pain has run dry, the rain in my heart has faded too.  
I've sold all my sorrows to have nothing left but peace...

Oh, I wish that every night I wouldn't feel heartbroken,  
Wanting to forget the silhouette you left in my heart...  
I can't count how many nights I've had to search,  
Searching for another reason for this nameless love!!!

I've stayed awake, awake through the night,  
I've tried so hard to forget you!  
But I know deep down in my heart I can't bear it... (can't bear it...)  
As night falls, I want to let go,  
Sorrow wraps around me, memories overflowing,  
I'm slowly dying day by day, oh my love!

I miss you so much,  
Oh, I miss you so much...  
I miss you more than I miss home,  
But you don't remember anything about us...  
When we were in love, we didn't understand how painful parting would be...  
Pain that cuts deep into the soul, and life turns to a frozen hue!

Oh, I wish that every night I wouldn't feel heartbroken,  
Wanting to forget the silhouette you left in my heart...  
I can't count how many nights I've had to search,  
Searching for another reason for this nameless love!!!

I've stayed awake, awake through the night,  
I've tried so hard to forget you!  
But I know deep down in my heart I can't bear it... (can't bear it...)  
As night falls, I want to let go,  
Sorrow wraps around me, memories overflowing,  
I'm slowly dying day by day, oh my love!
