**Translated Lyrics:**

If we don’t forget that day  
The day our lips met without a word  
Then the pain would have faded away through all the years, you and I  
When we met, my heart spoke without a sound  
As time drifts like clouds flying to the sky  
And I carry this dream with me, hoping for the day we unite

[Chorus]  
I will long for one person, that is you  
I will cherish so many lingering thoughts  
Those old eyes still hold sadness  
As the traces of time dissolve into the mist  
We see each other on this journey of life  
In that choked moment, I couldn’t step forward  
I greet you as if in a dream  
A dream where we are together

[Verse 2]  
If we don’t forget that day  
The day our lips met without a word  
Then the pain would have faded away through all the years, you and I  
When we met, my heart spoke without a sound  
As time drifts like clouds flying to the sky  
And I carry this dream with me, hoping for the day we unite

[Chorus]  
I will long for one person, that is you  
I will cherish so many lingering thoughts  
Those old eyes still hold sadness  
As the traces of time dissolve into the mist  
We see each other on this journey of life  
In that choked moment, I couldn’t step forward  
I greet you as if in a dream  
A dream where we are together

[Bridge]  
Waking up when the rain falls  
Memories of love rush back, making me realize  
The memories bring back the past  
Our story, choked with longing, waits patiently  
To return to that first moment

[Chorus]  
I will long for one person, that is you  
I will cherish so many lingering thoughts  
Those old eyes still hold sadness (those old eyes now)  
As the traces of time dissolve into the mist  
We see each other on this journey of life  
In that choked moment, I couldn’t step forward  
I greet you as if in a dream  
A dream where we are together
