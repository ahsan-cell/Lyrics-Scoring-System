**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kewtiie]  
(Hey, Kewtiie)

[Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
Stay with me just one more day  
'Cause I don’t want to sleep alone tonight  
We could go out and get drunk, or we could lie here all night  
I just don’t want to sleep alone tonight  

[Verse 1: HIEUTHUHAI]  
Whoo-oh, hey-y-eh  
Baby, tell me, share with me what you desire  
What you want after tonight passes by is a heart or some gifts  
Where do you want my hands to be? I’ve been longing for your lips since the very start  
I'm needing all your love  
But you won’t see me when tomorrow comes  
Because this Libra can’t stay with anyone forever  

Promise not to tell anyone  
How could I keep the image you sent me, yeah, yeah  
Instead of those times when you lay behind me holding me  

[Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI]  
Stay with me just one more day  
'Cause I don’t want to sleep alone tonight  
We could go out and get drunk, or we could lie here all night  
'Cause I don’t want to sleep alone tonight  

[Verse 2: Negav]  
It’s not about picking up or dropping off  
Just come to my place like you always do  
This isn’t your first time here  
Ooh, even if we’re not meant for each other  
Only I get to kiss your hair  
Don’t turn away when you change clothes  

Ooh-woah-ooh-ooh, ooh-woah-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh  
I know it’s wrong, but I can’t let you meet anyone  
You have to stay with me until tomorrow, yeah  
Just until tomorrow  
'Cause we’re just two lonely people coming together  

[Chorus: HIEUTHUHAI, Negav]  
Stay with me just one more day  
'Cause I don’t want to sleep alone tonight  
We could go out and get drunk, or we could lie here all night  
I just don’t want to sleep alone tonight  

I just don’t want to sleep alone tonight  
'Cause I don’t want to sleep alone tonight  

[Outro: HIEUTHUHAI, Negav]  
Yeah-yeah-y-yeah, yeah-yeah-y-yeah  
Baby, tell me, share with me what it is...
