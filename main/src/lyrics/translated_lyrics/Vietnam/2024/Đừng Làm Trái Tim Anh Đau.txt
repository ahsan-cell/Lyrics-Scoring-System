**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It seems that in my heart, there's no one but you anymore (Anymore)  
Every night I lie awake, lost in thought, forgetting everyone but you (But you)  
So there's no need to say more, love can't be summed up in just a few lines  
Trying too hard just makes me look foolish  
Uhm, it’s driving me crazy  
Waiting for you outside from morning till noon, evening, and now I’m stuck here (A-a-a-a)  
Whether against the sun or the wind, as long as I see you happy, not sad  
Just seeing that is enough, the sky is bright and clear (Uhm)  
Just seeing that brings more joy than a gift  
And with the next step, I’ll get a little closer to you

[Pre-Chorus]  
Then that day finally came, we had no idea (No idea)  
I won’t let this chance slip away, a gift from the heavens  
What’s there to hesitate about? I’ll approach you right away (Right away)  
I’ll try not to let you doubt me, even for a second right now  
Standing beside you makes me happy, my heart races and soars (Soars)  
I swear I’ll never forget this day  
It’s you, it’s you, only you I long for  
Always following only you, forever infatuated with you  
(Forever loving only you)

[Chorus]  
Then I’d gladly die for the one I love  
There are so many things still lingering in my heart  
All for you, all the love I carry for a lifetime  
Please don’t make my heart ache  
Then I’d gladly die for the one I love  
So many things still lingering in my heart  
All for you, all the love I carry for a lifetime  
Please don’t make my heart ache  

[Verse 2]  
By chance, I fell into your sweet smile (Sweet smile)  
I swear I don’t know how to escape from this  
Choosing a cool greeting is a must (A must)  
But suddenly, all I have are silly lines  
Come a little closer so I can gaze at you for a few minutes, lost in a heavenly dream  
Forget the troubles of the world, merge with the moon and stars, drifting endlessly  
I’ve said a lot, it’s been lengthy  
And just like that, the cycle repeats  
Feeling flustered, and if it doesn’t work out, it’s already night  
Just say it, “In this life, I only need you”  
Hiding all my longing deep within the lyrics, connecting these clumsy verses  
Writing our story for a day not far away, a day when we share a home

[Pre-Chorus]  
Then that day finally came, we had no idea (No idea)  
I won’t let this chance slip away, a gift from the heavens  
What’s there to hesitate about? I’ll approach you right away (Right away)  
I’ll try not to let you doubt me, even for a second right now  
Standing beside you makes me happy, my heart races and soars (Soars)  
I swear I’ll never forget this day  
It’s you, it’s you, only you I long for  
Always following only you, forever infatuated with you  
(Forever loving only you)

[Chorus]  
Then I’d gladly die for the one I love  
There are so many things still lingering in my heart  
All for you, all the love I carry for a lifetime  
Please don’t make my heart ache  
Then I’d gladly die for the one I love  
So many things still lingering in my heart  
All for you, all the love I carry for a lifetime  
Please don’t make my heart ache  
Then I’d gladly die for the one I love  
There are so many things still lingering in my heart  
All for you, all the love I carry for a lifetime  
Please don’t make my heart ache  
Then I’d gladly die for the one I love  
There are so many things still lingering in my heart  
All for you, all the love I carry for a lifetime  
Please don’t make my heart ache (Ooh, hey)

[Outro]  
La-la-la-la (Hey, hey, hey)  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Hey, hey, woo)  
La-la-la-la (Hey, hey, hey)  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Hey, hey, ha-ha-ha)  
La-la-la-la (Hey, hey, okay)  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la (Hey, hey, woo)  
(Don’t make my heart ache)  
One more time, one more time, one more time  
La-la-la-la (Hey, hey, hey)
