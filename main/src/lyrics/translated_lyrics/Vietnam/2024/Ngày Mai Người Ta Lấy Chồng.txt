**Translated Lyrics:**

Against the flow of the afternoon rain,
Who seeks whom beneath the moon?
Casting shadows on the long alley,
Who named memories
As the pain of yesterday?
Who called us strangers?
Was it last night spent awake,
To fold my heart into two halves?
The right side holds the pain,
While the left cradles a magical seed,
Just in time to bring as a gift for the bride.
Afraid that tomorrow, dew will fade, flowers wilt, clothes wear thin,
I wait for you, I choose the side of sorrow.

That day you walked in the rain,
Yet forgot to lock your heart’s door,
Letting the rain sneak in to inquire,
Stealing away our hundred-year vow.
The day you followed the drizzling rain,
A flock of lost birds cried out, frantically searching for one another.
Who counts all the drops of sorrow?
Asking autumn, drifting in a daze,
Every year, the season falls, countless yellow leaves,
Do you know where they are?
Is there a leaf that looks like the diêu bông?*
Oh diêu bông, oh diêu bông,
Before dawn breaks, I must find it,
For tomorrow, someone is getting married.
