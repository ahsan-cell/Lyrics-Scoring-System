**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Today the sky is clear and blue, beautiful like a painting  
Let’s wander around the world, no need to rush, just take our time  
A journey, a diary of love, I sing aimlessly about my first love, oh my dear  
That day, you were a girl in your twenties  
And now you've grown up, more mature, wearing a wedding dress  
Nothing can stop you, my dear, for you are forever graceful and wonderfully beautiful  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m in that poor countryside where there are a hundred hardships  
Wanting to go to the city, I must strive to keep my belly full  
Then I met you, those broken pieces of the past come back to mind  
Lying down, dreaming, calling your name  

[Chorus]  
Thien Ly, can you stay here with me?  
Do you know outside the stormy rain  
There’s so much loneliness, my dear  
Thien Ly, I only wish for your peace  
Holding hands tightly, then sitting on the hillside  

[Verse 2]  
Who do you love? Who are you loving now?  
Or are you alone, waiting for tomorrow and the future?  
Why not love right now, bring me your innocence?  
Tonight, will I dream, lost like a poet?  
Sitting alone, then feeling dazed again  
Some leave, while others stay, yet the heart remains confused  
What skies we once shared sweetly, then gently holding hands  
Your dress softly sways in the breeze  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m in that poor countryside where there are a hundred hardships  
Wanting to go to the city, I must strive to keep my belly full  
Then I met you, those broken pieces of the past come back to mind  
Lying down, dreaming, calling your name (Calling your name, forever lonely)  

[Chorus]  
Thien Ly, can you stay here with me?  
Do you know outside the stormy rain  
There’s so much loneliness, my dear  
Thien Ly, I only wish for your peace  
Holding hands tightly, then sitting on the hillside  

[Bridge]  
You are a dreamy fantasy  
Quiet like the cold winter wind at night  
Now the sky makes your cheeks rosy  
A lifetime of peace, I feel light-hearted  
The heavens keep us apart, making us a pair  

[Chorus]  
Thien Ly, can you stay here with me?  
Do you know outside the stormy rain  
There’s so much loneliness, my dear  
Thien Ly, I only wish for your peace  
Holding hands tightly, then sitting on the hillside
