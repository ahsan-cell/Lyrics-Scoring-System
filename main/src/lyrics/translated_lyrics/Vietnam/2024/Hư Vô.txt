**Where are you?**  
I search endlessly for the answer,  
Why must we be apart?  
Since the day you left,  
I can't love anyone else.  
I still remember  
Those fading days...

Each sweet memory,  
Now just clouds drifting in the high sky.  
Each warm word from long ago,  
Carried away by the wind...  
Each longing still surges,  
Bringing deep pain along...  
Where are you? Where are you now?

I still wait,  
For those petty angry words,  
I still wait,  
For your innocent smile.  
Trapped in a heartache through the long nights,  
Only I embrace this dream.  
I still remember,  
Am I really foolish?  
Why do I still cry for you...  
Just to temporarily forget and we  
Will love each other more.

The end of the road of love is tragedy,  
No one wants to step there.  
But we couldn't hold on,  
Together reaching the destination,  
Then both must struggle to forget.

Forget that I once loved,  
Forget the one I once understood,  
To gradually erase the pain,  
And to grow stronger.  
Who knows when we meet again,  
Both won't hesitate to show respect and shake hands.  
But that's the future,  
In the present, I'm mad,  
With your image lingering,  
I drown in nothingness.  
In the middle of the night, suddenly waking,  
Looking at the memories stored,  
Realizing you are the most precious thing.  
One last time, please save  
This tender heart of mine.  
Come back and be with me,  
I wait for the boat to dock,  
Steering steady and strong,  
Even if storms come unexpectedly.  
We will still love each other more.

A second of love when hearts and eyes intertwine, souls bound in dreams.  
Verses built on countless promises that won’t shatter.  
A moment of forgetting when thoughts are desolate, we don’t reach out to each other on cold, rainy nights.  
One person remains silent, while the other...  
Our story is all arguments,  
Who wins, who loses?  
Our feelings built together,  
But being together for personal gain,  
How can it last?  
How to overcome obstacles?  
Asking you to understand is impossible,  
Because from the start, we were strangers.  
You first or I later,  
Don’t gamble when you don’t know each other.  
Because whether you lose or I win,  
We both leave empty-handed.  
So let’s stop crying, stop hoping,  
Stop waiting, stop looking.  
After a love affair, we learn many things.  
I hope we will forget and continue to love again.
