**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part 1: Dušan Vlk]**  
**[Duški]**  
Today I turn 30 and watch the night traffic light  
I have so many thoughts in my head, I could be a teacher  
And I’m done with the silence, it’s just fake promotion  
Please lock the door because I won’t be coming home today  

Everyone who felt like they were something big  
What did they expect? They’re tapping me for a follow after school  
Everyone here had big words, felt like a demigod  
It was enough for me to know who to keep at bay  

But today I’m careful about who I let into my circle  
Today I’m living well and I’m not waiting for an apology  
T-t-today I count the time and live while I’m alive  
But I remember that I must die, no illusions  

Pull down your blinds, death has been waiting outside [waiting outside]  
In the underground, we form a clan, feel free to keep your throne  
Pull down your blinds, death has been waiting outside [waiting outside]  
In the underground, we create sounds until they’re interrupted by a bell  

**[Chorus: Dušan Vlk]**  
And when we step outside, we open different doors  
Here we hold on tight, they can’t do anything to us  
This pain is meant to be temporary, we’ve gotten used to it  
And I’m afraid that when it passes, I won’t have any oxygen  

And when we step outside, we open different doors  
Here we hold on tight, they can’t do anything to us  
This pain is meant to be temporary, we’ve gotten used to it  
And I’m afraid that when it passes, I won’t have any oxygen  

**[Part 2: RNZ]**  
**[Okay shorty]**  
Breathe, please breathe  
Now is not the right time to exit  
I know life isn’t without mistakes  
We agreed to mess it up together  
So please don’t run alone to the shared grave  

Just a moment, this can’t be the end  
Where faith doesn’t help, physical pain will, I know  
Sharp edges need to be guarded  
I constantly think about death but I don’t want to experience it anymore  

And I also don’t have the appetite for empty words  
So I’ve damned humanity, hidden trust in the dark  
I’ve reduced the numbers, the circle has closed  
No one new has a chance, there’s no room for error  

And when we step outside, we open different doors  
But we don’t want to die anymore, so don’t worry about us, mom  
Here we hold on tight, together we walk through hell  
And in the end, they won’t hurt us anymore, I’m not afraid, I know it  

**[Chorus: Dušan Vlk]**  
And when we step outside, we open different doors  
Here we hold on tight, they can’t do anything to us  
This pain is meant to be temporary, we’ve gotten used to it  
And I’m afraid that when it passes, I won’t have any oxygen  

And when we step outside, we open different doors  
Here we hold on tight, they can’t do anything to us  
This pain is meant to be temporary, we’ve gotten used to it  
And I’m afraid that when it passes, I won’t have any oxygen
