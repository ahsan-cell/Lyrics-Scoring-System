**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Kiss me  
No, you don't have to think too much  
Love me  
Just tell me something, show me the way to you  

Touch me  
Touch, touch  
To me, touch me  
Touch, uh, touch  
Touch me  

[Chorus]  
Do whatever you want, but don’t look at me like that  
It makes me dizzy  
Every night I dream of you  
You rush and make me spin around  
Slow down, baby, slow down, baby, slow down  
Baby, slow down because  

[Verse 1]  
I know what you need (Hm-hm)  
Turn off the lights but just enough to see your whispering lips (Yeah, yeah)  
So the streetlight shines on your hair, baby  
Getting closer to hear your heartbeat clearly  
Everything seems to be arranged, baby, what do you want to do now?  
You keep giving me all the wounds, I’ll help you forget them all  
Come to me and hold tight as if this is the last time  
You believe in a miracle that only happens with me  

[Refrain]  
B-b-b, baby, slow down, baby, slow down (Ooh-woah-oh-oh-hoh-oh)  
Baby, slow down, baby, slow down (No-ooh-oh-ooh-oh)  
Baby, slow down, baby, slow down  

[Verse 2]  
Baby (Shh)  
Focus on (Ah, hm, yeah)  
No one else, just us here (Here, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  

Hm, baby (Hm, yeah)  
Focus on it, girl  
It’s in your DNA (Hm-hm, ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ooh-ah)  

[Bridge]  
I still can’t forget the stars in your eyes (Tell me)  
So you have, are, and will unintentionally make me fall in love  
Baby  

[Chorus]  
Do whatever you want, but don’t look at me like that  
It makes me dizzy (Oh-hoh-oh)  
Every night I dream of you (Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
You rush and make me spin around (Oh-oh-oh)  
Slow down, baby, slow down, baby, slow down  

[Refrain]  
B-b-b, baby, slow down (baby), baby, slow down (Ooh-woah-oh-oh-hoh-oh)  
Baby, slow down, baby, slow down  
Baby, slow down, baby, slow down  
Baby, slow down to  

[Outro]  
Kiss me  
No, you don't have to think too much  
Love me  
Just tell me something, show me the way to you
