**Translated Lyrics:**

I don’t want to fight it, would you stay the night  
Tell me if it’s real  
I can see it in your eyes, we can do this if we try  
(But)  
Why did you let me see  
The shadow of someone there?  
Feels like I’m just a teen again  
(When you hurt me, you hurt yourself  
When you hurt me, baby, you hurt yourself)  
Why doesn’t anyone know  
How to say what sounds right? My love only exists  
In novels  
Lighting up those doe-like eyes, sparkling as we walk side by side  
Why did you let me see  
The shadow of someone there?  
Feels like I’m just a teen again  
(When you hurt me, you hurt yourself  
Baby, when you hurt me, you hurt yourself)  
Sending my exes all to jail (Jail!)  
Shaking my ass in a Benz (Benz!)  
I keep running it up, cut me them checks (Check it!)  
Just to see you’re full of lies (Bitch! bitch!)  
(Lies, lies, lies)
