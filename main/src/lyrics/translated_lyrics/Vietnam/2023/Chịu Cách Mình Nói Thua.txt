**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Rhyder]  
Here we are again, DG House  
Rhyder (Cool-Cool-CoolKidNeverSleep)

[Chorus: Rhyder]  
This time I admit defeat to you  
You left me in the dark of night  
Tears suddenly fell from my eyes, one holds on, one lets go  
I told you to never leave me alone  
This time I admit defeat to you  
There’s no chance left, oh babe, if only you loved me too  
I told you to never leave me alone

[Verse 1: BAN]  
And now the picture we painted of love has faded  
Yeah, you broke, broke, broke my heart, yeah  
Why not just say it, now who do you need? (Who? Who?)  
Not me, no, no, no, no, no  
Mm, so be it  
If we can’t be a couple, then so be it  
So now our love story has come to an end  
Once it was the most beautiful love in the world

[Chorus: Rhyder]  
This time I admit defeat to you  
You left me in the dark of night  
Tears suddenly fell from my eyes, one holds on, one lets go  
I told you to never leave me alone  
This time I admit defeat to you  
There’s no chance left, oh babe, if only you loved me too  
I told you to never leave me alone

[Verse 2: CoolKid]  
My heart hurts so much, I say let go but it’s not that easy  
There’s no more chances, babe, oh, yeah  
Baby, are you really that bad? The outcome is still the same, nothing changes  
Another sad song, how I feel about love, no cap  
Seeing me in this state, is this what you wanted to see?  
Oh baby, no, no, no  
Throw away all the memories behind, if we don’t need each other anymore  
Oh, babe

[Chorus: Rhyder]  
This time I admit defeat to you  
You left me in the dark of night  
Tears suddenly fell from my eyes, one holds on, one lets go  
I told you to never leave me alone  
This time I admit defeat to you  
There’s no chance left, oh babe, if only you loved me too  
I told you to never leave me alone
