**Translated Lyrics:**

Love you so, love you so, love you so  
Baby, love you so  
Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I can say  

'Cause I love you so, love you so, love you so  
Baby, love you so  
Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I can say  
'Cause I...

[Verse 1: Wean]  
Waking up, opening my eyes  
The TV still on from last night, I thought I had turned it off  
That dream was gentle, the sound of rain falling at the door  
Remembering those times we blended, our silhouettes appearing on the curtain  

She has a compassionate heart, sometimes angry with herself  
She really doesn’t want to feel like she’s standing on a scale  
Between what she likes and what she needs, losing herself a few times  
Always influenced by the sounds echoing so close  

She really hates how people can go crazy over what they do  
But she never turns away  
From the beggars wandering the streets  
Or her scattered thoughts that sometimes align  
What she can’t do without is a cup of coffee every morning  
Starting  
That colorful soul  
She truly believes in the bridge of connection  

Sow the seeds, and you’ll reap the consequences, reminding me to stay alert  
In a world that always deceives  
Sometimes very hard to understand and sometimes very hard to please  
But one thing I believe is that girls like her are rare out there  

And the kiss in the elevator  
The Earth keeps spinning  
We’ll still be here  
Even if everything changes  

Like a good book  
Only daring to read slowly because I don’t want to see the ending  
If one day we stop  
Baby, please take it all with you  

[Chorus: Wean]  
Love you so, love you so, love you so  
Baby, love you so  
Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I can say  
'Cause I love you so, love you so, love you so  
Baby, love you so  
Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I can say  
'Cause I...

[Verse 2: Wean]  
Love you so  
We walk home together when the night is dim  
Love you so  
A phrase that flows from the start until now  

How long it takes to say it all  
Let me do, let me do it  
Hearing my heart speaking  
All the feelings I want to write...  

On paper  
What I see  
I really wanna say it again  
I love you so, love you so  

[Chorus: Tùng]  
Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  
Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  
Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I can say  

Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  
Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  

Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I...

[Verse 3]  
An old dream, a few letters  
And the storms fading in color  
Oh darling, please sleep so tomorrow  
Is like everything we haven’t started yet  

And you sing again at dawn  
You cry for a bad movie  
Waiting alone to find an excuse for a poetic love  
And accidentally see you standing outside the door  

Turning love into something timeless  
The scent of our clothes becomes an old smell  
Ginger chicken becomes a staple dish  
And I tell myself that every love season is autumn  

The bird on the branch sings about love  
To save for a distant season but  
Distance is just distance, our love fades and then passes  
And we sit singing about our love like yesterday, truly  

[Chorus/Outro: Wean, Tùng]  
Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  
Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  

Love you more than I can say  
Love you more than I can say  

I love you so  

Love you so  
Baby, I love you so  
Love you so  
Baby, I love love love love you so  

Love you more than I...
