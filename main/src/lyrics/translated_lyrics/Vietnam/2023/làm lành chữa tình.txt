**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I know (I know)  
That there must be times we feel angry (That there must be times we feel angry)  
It's just a test (It's just a test)  
Do we have enough love to accept each other's imperfections? (Yeah)  

Because love is not a game to find a winner  
I don’t want anyone to give up and disappear  
Thank you for staying, yielding, and being more patient  
(It's just love, love, love)  

So I will try to make this place safe so we won’t be afraid  
Like when we were 17, being friends, laughing freely  
Love will awaken in you an everlasting summer  

[Chorus]  
So let’s make up and heal this love (Heal the love, heal the love)  
Let’s make up to heal this love (Heal this love, heal the love, heal the love)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Let's make love-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove, hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ah, yah-ah-ah  
Let's make love-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove, hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ah  
Hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ah  

[Verse 2]  
Accepting the anger, voicing what burdens us  
We get a little closer, that’s part of it  
And I don’t want tonight’s dinner to taste bad  
And I can’t sleep well at night, so how about we make peace?  
Because I can’t take it anymore  
Tell me the reasons for your anger so I can love you and understand you better, baby  

You know not everyone is brave enough to face all the emotions (Love)  
Not everyone can be angry yet still caring, gentle, and quietly concerned (Like you)  
Thank you for always patiently explaining, for listening to my secret feelings  
Now I want a little intimacy, is that okay?  

[Chorus]  
So let’s make up and heal this love (Heal the love, heal the love)  
Let’s make up to heal this love (Heal this love, heal the love, heal the love)  

[Post-Chorus]  
Let's make love  
Even though sometimes we feel angry, we will learn to love each other more (Ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove, hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ah)  
Let’s allow ourselves to feel anger because everyone wants to be loved (Yah-ah-ah, let's make love)  
Even though sometimes we feel angry, it’s wonderful to see someone angry (Ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove-ove, hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ah)  
Because our loved ones are honest, and we will learn to love more (Hoh-ooh-ah-ooh-ah-ah, yeah)
