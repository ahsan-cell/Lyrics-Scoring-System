**Good Boy**

[Verse 1]  
Every minute drifts away, fading memories between us (Hoo!)  
Every bit of yesterday's longing gets lost, just like that it fades (Hoo!)  
My heart no longer beats in sync with yours  
That once warm smile is now cold and distant  
Indifferent, ignoring the future, who would have guessed?  
Forgetting the dreams of youth, dissolving like mist  
The rain quietly falls on this empty road this evening (Yah)  
Etching tears that blur my sorrowful eyes  
All the promises wither and vanish (Yah)  
Drifting away, sinking into intoxicating dreams  
Turning away, splitting our paths  
Now it's just me alone  
Deceit suddenly reigns  
In the dark night  
Companioned only by loneliness  
My thoughts, suppressed, have ignited the love I once gave you

[Refrain]  
(Burn it all)  
The pink lipstick lingering on your lips for so long (Hah)  
The gentle fragrance that has entranced me for so long (Burn it all)  
I no longer expect your concern  
The future from now on is like a painting you've forgotten to color (Burn it all)  
Please bury your name in the pain (Hah)  
In the desolation, a thousand sorrows lay waste (Burn it all)  
The echoes of ashes are hopeless behind  
Struggling, tormenting, tearing around this tattered body

[Chorus]  
Run away before  
Everything gets worse (Burn it all)  
Run away before  
Hatred rolls in waves (Burn it all)  
Like a storm coming to visit  
From the depths of darkness (Oh)  
Run away (Run away) before (Before)  
Everything gets worse

[Post-Chorus]  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future (Hoo!)  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future (Hoo!)  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future (Hoo!)  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future

[Verse 2]  
Yeah  
Letting go of your hand, relinquishing hope, letting go of peace (Let go)  
No longer are the days bright, they fade deeply and endlessly  
The wounds keep carving deeper and deeper  
Trampling, crushing, stepping on the warmth of love  
Looking back at the trust I once gave, how after all this foolishness, I still feel weak  
The room confines, burning the lonely soul, you cry out in anguish (La-la-la, la-la)  
Resentment surges, staining black, pressing down on your shoulders, don’t expect forgiveness (Ah)  
You caused it all  
The things that just happened  
You caused it all, you caused it all  
The things that just happened  
It’s really over

[Refrain]  
(Burn it all)  
The pink lipstick lingering on your lips for so long (Hah)  
The gentle fragrance that has entranced me for so long (Burn it all)  
I no longer expect your concern  
The future from now on is like a painting you've forgotten to color (Burn it all)  
Please bury your name in the pain (Hah)  
In the desolation, a thousand sorrows lay waste (Burn it all)  
The echoes of ashes are hopeless behind  
Struggling, tormenting, tearing around this tattered body

[Chorus]  
Run away before  
Everything gets worse (Burn it all)  
Run away before  
Hatred rolls in waves (Burn it all)  
Like a storm coming to visit (Ah)  
From the depths of darkness  
Run away (Run away) before (Before)  
Everything gets worse

[Post-Chorus]  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future (Hoo!)  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future (Hoo!)  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future (Hoo!)  
No one will be by your side tomorrow  
Farewell to a twisted future

[Bridge]  
Burn it all (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(You caused it all, you caused it all)  
Burn it all (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh), hah  
Don’t look at me with that unfamiliar face  
Please don’t wander through my mind every night anymore  
Forget it, forget it all  
Forget it, forget it all  
Ignite the cold pity that embraces the shattered dream (Ah)

[Post-Bridge]  
Flames of hatred rise within me (Forget it, forget it all)  
The hatred within me (Oh-oh-oh)  
Flames
