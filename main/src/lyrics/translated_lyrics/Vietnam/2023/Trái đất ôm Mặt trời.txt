**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1 - Unknown]**
If you hate the web rap, just dive in to disrupt,
This isn’t a saint, no one’s here to stir up a storm.
This isn’t a test, not a genius, just go ahead and fight,
I like to sit back, watch TV, enjoy comedies, and Yến Vi films.
If you hate it, then just leave,
What’s the point of rapping if you’re not skilled?
Feeling insecure in a world full of tall people, you’re just sulking.
Writing battle letters, losing troops, where do we deploy?
The wives and concubines hold grudges, crying without knowing why.
Looking back at all this time,
When it comes to Vietnamese, my skills are at the top.
You’ve leveled up to a monkey, a spirit on an island,
Looking back, my words hit like a whirlwind against the tower.
Again looking back, life’s too much, over thirty, soon to be gray,
Still empty-handed, youth is passing, bitterly so.

**[Hook 1 - Drojk]**
Turn over the back of all the efforts to find a place where no one waits anymore...
It’s not easy to find someone who hasn’t once lived a certain way,
Existing without knowing if growing up is even worth it.
The world isn’t just for anyone; it doesn’t need a minority.

**[Verse 2 - Yung K]**
Strangers, even if they know nothing about me, why do they talk so much?
No need to speak up for people to see that I can talk a lot?
Yesterday you were calm, today you flip like the wind changes direction,
But whatever face you show, your true nature doesn’t change.
Before criticizing someone,
You should look back at yourself and laugh at your own reflection.
Check if your way of living is worthy yet?
And see if your character is thick enough to condemn?
Even geniuses have to rise from the dirt,
And when the time is up, even diamonds must crack.
Many say they rap out of passion,
But when they see fame and fortune, their faces show greed.
Looking back at the past to realize that I’m also ordinary,
Even if you’re a big boss, there was a time you had to hide under the bed.
Music is cheap, written today and forgotten tomorrow,
But what’s there to fear when you can easily change your name?
Like a superhero, even trash can fly high,
So when the old men run out of steam, they just need to change the chain.

**[Verse 3 - Rhymastic]**
Vietnamese rap is now dominated by a bunch of kids,
Delusional, always thinking they’re as powerful as Doraemon.
Loving to be praised until they burst like a balloon,
After beef, it’s peace, spinning around like a top.
Drop a diss track and spend the whole day waiting,
Replying back and forth, the game just goes round and round.
How long will this last?
Online, puffing up to insult, then going home to hug a pillow, feeling frustrated.
Smiling on the outside but boiling inside,
Gone are the days when you sat hugging a computer seeking fame.
Rappers compete to get on records while I need to make a living,
Battle rap now is just sitting and cursing for fun.
Make music that’s truly great, then just sniff it until bored,
You’re the king online but a slave to the virtual world,
So who’s better when the one controlling life is me?
I live in reality while you’re lost in dreams,
I’d rather be a person than follow you as a god up high.

**[Verse 4 - Lil Cì]**
How far can you go, staring wide-eyed behind you?
A sea of people, feet trying to move but unaware of where they’re headed.
Your face is gradually distorting, unable to distinguish your form,
No special talent but always comparing skills.
Who respects me, I respect back,
If you don’t want to drink the offered wine, I’ll slap you awake.
If your eyes can’t open, how can you see life?
Or is it just
