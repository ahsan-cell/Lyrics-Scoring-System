**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Hòa Minzy]  
In the village, up and down, east and west,  
The daughter of a wealthy man is named Mầu Thị.  
A love that’s unexpected, a full moon has come (Hi-hi).  
Inviting young and old, boys and girls to the feast, let’s eat together, í-a, í-à.

[Verse: Hòa Minzy]  
I proudly call myself Thị Mầu, the daughter of a wealthy man.  
I’m still quite young, not yet at the full moon.  
Oh, my sisters, today is the fourth, tomorrow I’ll be fifteen.  
Who wants to go eat rice cakes, come to the temple with me.

[Pre-Chorus: Hòa Minzy]  
Ah, a-i-a-ì-a, a-i-a-ì-a,  
I’ve been going to the temple since I was thirteen.  
Ah, a-i-a-ì-a, a-i-a-ì-a,  
I’ll be at the temple on the fifteenth.

[Chorus: Hòa Minzy]  
Oh, Master Tiểu, I am Thị Mầu.  
I don’t know why, but I keep demanding.  
Call my mother, tell my father, let the whole village know,  
Let me marry him.  
Ting tang tang, ting ting tang.

Tang ting tang, ting ting tang.  
Ting tang tang, ting ting tang.  
Oh, village folk!

[Breakdown: Hòa Minzy]  
B-B-Boh, village folk!  
Ah-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha.

Oh, Master Tiểu, I am Thị Mầu.  
I don’t know why, but I keep demanding.  
Call my mother, tell my father, let the whole village know,

Ting tang tang, ting ting tang (A-hi-hi-hi-hi).
