**Translated Lyrics:**

The melody in my mind softly resonates,  
Thoughts and reflections flow abundantly, endlessly.  
Where do these verses and poems come from,  
Is it longing that arises because of you?

[Verse 1]  
Sparkling like the stars (Bling, bling)  
Shining high up in the sky (Ah-ah-ah)  
Faintly, there's a silhouette,  
A smile like sunshine (Sunshine)  
Gentle and so lovely.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Graceful and pure, that's you,  
Your lips rich and fresh like dawn,  
Hair cascading lightly on your shoulders (Ah),  
A fragrance soft and sweet like a flower.  
Butterflies and bees flutter around,  
Charming and truly beautiful,  
Joyful and innocent, oh so adorable,  
A sweet voice full of warmth,  
Oh, the girl of my dreams, my muse.

[Chorus]  
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, you shine so bright,  
Carefree, humming and dancing in the morning light.  
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, you shine so bright,  
The world becomes a painting whenever you're in sight.  
You’re stunning, oh,  
Your heart, your spirit, your grace,  
Oh-yeah, oh-yeah, ah-oh-yeah.

[Verse 2]  
No makeup, no powder (Yeah),  
Even the moon feels shy, flowers yield (Ah).  
The water sways, the city tilts (Ohh),  
The wind rustles, clouds swirl whenever you smile.  
Simple yet so comforting,  
The essence of heaven and earth,  
No treasure compares to you,  
No gem can match your worth.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Your lips rich and fresh like dawn,  
Hair cascading lightly on your shoulders (Ah),  
A fragrance soft and sweet like a flower.  
Butterflies and bees flutter around,  
Charming and truly beautiful,  
Joyful and innocent, oh so adorable,  
A sweet voice full of warmth,  
Oh, the girl of my dreams, my muse.

[Chorus]  
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, you shine so bright,  
Carefree, humming and dancing in the morning light.  
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, you shine so bright,  
The world becomes a painting whenever you're in sight.  
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful, shining so bright,  
Dancing and singing in the morning light,  
The world becomes a painting whenever you're in sight.
