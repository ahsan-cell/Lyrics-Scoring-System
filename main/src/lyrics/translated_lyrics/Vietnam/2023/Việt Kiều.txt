**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook]  
Baby, sometimes I find it hard to give this heart to you  
On God, I'd be lying if I said I didn't try to make you feel confused  
Baby, I wonder, how much can you take from me?  
Baby, I wonder, you, hooh-oh-oh  

[Verse 1]  
Huh, are you crazy?  
Nah, don’t say anymore, I get it (I know)  
I know everything, no need to guess  
Nah, don’t love me because baby, I don't love you anymore  
(No way!)  

Baby, I'm out here  
In Vietnam, I'm taking risks  
I'm hungry, I'm chasing  
Dreaming big is an understatement  
When we do it, we do it right, no half measures  
No matter how hungry we get, no one complains  
Working through the holidays, we’re on the grind  
The love for music can’t be left behind  

The guys in Hanoi are all about the charm  
I’m handsome because of my good deeds  
Try loving me and you won’t have regrets (regrets about what?)  
Talk about if he's Asian, I’m gonna pass, yeah  
Pass it to your Asian friend who’s gonna smash  
Big smash  

Yeah, they will talk about me  
My city’s gonna talk about me  
The girls are gonna talk about me  
The guys are gonna talk about me  
I live quietly and don’t show off  
I don’t like to reveal too much, ah (Shhh)  
In real life, I’m just as described  
Maybe a bit more handsome  

[Hook]  
Baby, sometimes I find it hard to give this heart to you  
On God, I'd be lying if I said I didn't try to make you feel confused  
Baby, I wonder, how much can you take from me?  
Baby, I wonder  
You  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba  

[Bridge]  
Hey pretty girl, from a wealthy home  
Giving you love is worth more than giving you spending money, yeah  
Hey pretty girl, overseas Vietnamese  
Giving you love but now you return it with bitterness  
We’re like cinnamon flowers, I hope you don’t mind  
If you still complain, I’ll take you to the riverbank, yeah  
We’re from Thanh Hoá but raised in Hanoi  
Giving you love, yeah, yeah  

[Verse 2]  
Baby, we’ve got momentum, I know it’s hard to keep something like this nowadays, yeah  
The culture doesn’t want me to be romantic  
The world we live in today, huh  
Gotta be careful when a girl approaches you for a kiss  
It gets sticky, it gets tricky even with a kiss  
I don’t want no kiss  
Damn
