**Translated Lyrics:**

Five-thirty in the morning every day, but I hardly do anything  
Because I keep thinking you’re still here with me  
Twenty-four hours feel too long, so I have to find something to do  
But I know we can’t keep watering the plants like this  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
So where’s the paper and pen?  
Let’s just finish this line  
Do you want to hear the melody I sing  
To express the words I wish to say?  

**[Chorus]**  
That each passing day  
I just wait for you to come by  
Just like a flower longing for the sun  
I’ll be happy if you smile  
No need to send me a word  
A lonely guy’s story, I’ve grown used to it  
Just a distant sunflower  

**[Verse 2]**  
I know you’ve been busy these days  
So go on, I’ll still be right here  
In twenty-four hours each day, don’t forget about me  
And do you want to hear the melody I sing  
To express the words I wish to say?  

**[Chorus]**  
That each passing day  
I just wait for you to come by  
Just like a flower longing for the sun  
I’ll feel joy if you smile  
No need to send me half a word  
A lonely guy’s story, I’ve grown used to it  

Searching for you from the drying yard  
Because you’re out playing  
Leaving behind a lonely sunflower  
When you feel sad, just come and play  
But if you don’t come, that’s fine  
We’ve grown used to being lonely  
Just a sunflower, that’s all  

**[Bridge]**  
You travel far, whether you go to G or F  
I don’t mind at all  
I’m always by your side, even if unseen  
Silently dreaming of you, filled with love  
Even if it’s just unrequited  

**[Chorus]**  
That each passing day  
I just wait for you to come by  
Just like a flower longing for the sun  
I’ll be happy if you smile  
No need to send me half a word  
A lonely guy’s story,  
Searching for you from the drying yard  
Because you’re out playing  
Leaving behind a lonely sunflower  
When you feel sad, just come and play  
But if you don’t come, that’s fine  
We’ve grown used to being lonely  
Just a sunflower, that’s all  

**[Outro]**  
Just a distant sunflower.
