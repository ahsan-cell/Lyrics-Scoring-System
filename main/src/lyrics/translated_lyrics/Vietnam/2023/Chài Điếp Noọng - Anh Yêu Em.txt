**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Double2T]  
Hey there, hey there  
Hey there, hey there  

[Verse 1: Hòa Minzy, Double2T]  
These feet follow  
Every heartbeat's rhythm  
Of a heart that feels  
How can I not utter two words of longing?  
The vast mountains and forests  
Seem to guide us both  
As if we’ve known each other for so long  
Drowning deep in your brown eyes (Following the fish to the stream)  

[Verse 2: Double2T]  
Babe, you look so pretty  
I guess you're around the Year of the Dragon  
A city girl, just my type that I’ve been searching for  
After drinking corn wine, we’re both tipsy  
I want to take your hand and go out  
In Tày language, it’s "pây lỉn"  
Because my belly is good  
My village is very simple, dear  
Not like a beast in human disguise  
Busy with a dirty face  
You’ve walked through glamorous cities  
I’ll take you far away to my village, it’s even more fun than that  
Running away from the hustle  
And the dust of the city  
To the hills, blending into nature  
No need to force it, no need to try  
In the city, they call you babe  
Here, I call you noọng  
Hey there, I’ll take you along  
Then I’ll say "chài điếp noọng"  

[Chorus: Hòa Minzy, Double2T]  
Do you know if I love you or just playfully tease?  
Well, you don’t believe it  
If you want me to fall in love with a village boy  
What can you give me as proof?  
I’m not good at English  
But I know loving you means I love you  
It sounds good to me  
So let me speak Tày  
Tày means "noọng điếp chài"  

[Post-Chorus: Both]  
Do re sol la sol, follow me to the village (Oh yes)  
Kin lẩu on the floor  
By the fire, with you lost in bliss  
Chài điếp noọng  

[Verse 3: Double2T]  
I don’t know about romantic words  
Like city boys do  
But I’m drunk on you like I am on wine  
Need to be by the pot of hot stew  
Where I close the door, it opens up  
A village without a lot of vehicles  
But the people here are genuine and honest  
No deceitful hustle  
Just hold my hand tight, I’ll lead you  
The folks in the village are sincere  
They won’t let your eyes fill with tears  
Up to the fields when the sun rises, back when it’s dark  
Sitting around the fire  
Eating simple mèn mén like that  
You may not know how to sew or weave  
But this city girl knows how to tune  
I’m not like the city boys  
My hair’s a bit messy  
Driving traps like going downhill  
Pouring my heart into yours  
Because I’m a true village boy  
With three pieces of land  
Farming and producing  
Money for marriage, I give to my mom to save  
Up to the fields with a handful by the fire all night  
Drunk on you and the drink  
Other guys see and must be jealous  

[Chorus: Hòa Minzy, Double2T]  
Do you know if I love you or just playfully tease?  
Well, you don’t believe it  
If you want me to fall in love with a village boy  
What can you give me as proof?  
I’m not good at English  
But I know loving you means I love you  
It sounds good to me  
So let me speak Tày  
Tày means "noọng điếp chài"  

[Post-Chorus: Double2T]  
You like shooting arrows, like pushing sticks  
Or like playing with balls  
Like playing stilts, like playing khăng  
I’ll let you choose  
Today the earth and sky harmonize  
Come be my wife, okay?  
Hey, come with me to the village, okay?  

[Outro: Hòa Minzy, Double2T]  
These feet follow  
Every heartbeat's rhythm  
Of a heart that feels  
How can I not utter two words of longing?  
(Hey there, hey there)
