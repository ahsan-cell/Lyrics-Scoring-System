**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Wean]  
(Hello)  
(Yeah I know baby)  
(Don't cry baby)  

[Chorus: Wean]  
What’s the need to say, my dear?  
We don’t really need to talk too much, you see.  
Place a finger on your lips,  
And just stop thinking, my dear.  
Let’s do it for the things we love,  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that!  

Do it with your love (Your love)  
Don’t do it for the fame! (The fame)  
Do it with your love (Your love)  
Just do it, my friends! (My friends)  
Do it with your love (Your love)  
You can't be perfect!  
Do it with your love  
'Cause you're not your mistakes.  

[Verse 1: Wean]  
Just keep smiling, listen to me,  
But don’t let your makeup run.  
Don’t see yourself as weak (Baby),  
Whenever, who’s ever praised us?  
Yeah, we go somewhere only we know,  
And don’t listen to what others want us to be.  
Just follow, baby, just follow (Just follow)  
The innocence inside, just like at the start!  

[Chorus: Wean]  
What’s the need to say, my dear? (Keep silent and keep silent)  
Place a finger on your lips (Keep silent and keep silent)  
What’s the need to say, my dear? (Baby, why do we need to talk?)  
Place a finger on your lips (Yeah, you don’t need to say much).  

What’s the need to say, my dear?  
We don’t really need to talk too much, you see.  
Place a finger on your lips and just stop thinking,  
Let’s do it for the things we love.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that!  

[Verse 2: tlinh]  
We don’t really need to talk too much,  
Your hands are so pretty, take them.  
Thank you for always holding me and kissing me when my tears smudge my makeup.  
When they gossip and spread rumors,  
By your side, I feel so peaceful.  
Whatever they want to say, I’m okay with it.  
Yeah, in those moments of weakness, you hold me tight.  
Even without words, I truly appreciate it.  
You show me what’s important,  
A man full of love and understanding.  
It's you! Oh, you show me love  
When I need it most.  
I can't thank you enough!  
And I still do it with my love,  
Do it from my heart,  
Do it for my mama and papa,  
And for my fam.  
And the words they gossip about  
Will suddenly become lovely  
When seen through the lens of love,  
Because love creates miracles.  

[Bridge: tlinh]  
Oh yeah! Oh! Oh yeah! (My dear!)  

[Chorus: Wean & tlinh]  
What’s the need to say, my dear? (Baby, why do we need to talk?)  
(Yeah, you don’t need to say much)  
Place a finger on your lips.  
What’s the need to say, my dear?  
We don’t really need to talk too much, you see.  
Place a finger on your lips and just stop thinking,  
Let’s do it for the things we love.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that.  
You shouldn’t think too much, no need for that!  

Do it with your love (Love)  
Don't do it for the fame (Fame)  
Do it with your love (Love)  
Just do it, my friends! (Yeah)  
Do it with your love (Oh yeah)  
You can't be perfect.  
Do it with your love  
'Cause you're not your mistakes.  

[Outro: Wean]  
What’s the need to say, my dear?  
Yeah, because everything is settled now.  
Baby, you don’t need to say anything,  
Because we can’t change anything.  
So why say anything, my dear?  
So why say anything, my dear?  
Why say anything, ahhh?
