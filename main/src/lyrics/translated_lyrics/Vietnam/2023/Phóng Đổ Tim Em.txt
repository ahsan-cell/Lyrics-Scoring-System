**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
If you want,  
Come here and I'll take on all your worries and fears,  
You just need to look ahead.  

If you want,  
If tomorrow the whole world turns its back,  
I will be the enemy of the world (Ah-ooh).  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let me take care,  
Once you're in love with me, there's no escaping it,  
Trust me, I’ll always be by your side to give you confidence.  
Once you're in love with me, no matter what happens,  
It’s because of me, wherever you go, I’ll follow you because...  

[Chorus]  
Baby girl, baby girl, please always smile,  
Hey girl, just be carefree when we’re together.  
Baby girl, baby girl, you look best when you smile,  
Hey girl, just be carefree, I’ll protect you from behind.  

[Verse]  
If you want,  
Come here and I'll take on all your worries and fears,  
You just need to look ahead.  
What I want every time I see you, so innocent and enchanted,  
I ask for a role to guard you forever.  

[Verse 2]  
Let me take care,  
Once you're in love with me, there's no escaping it,  
Because I’m Wren, the one who’ll steal your heart.  
Once you're in love with me, no matter what happens,  
It’s because of me, wherever you go, I’ll follow you because...  

[Chorus]  
Baby girl, baby girl, please always smile,  
Hey girl, just be carefree when we’re together.  
Baby girl, baby girl, you look best when you smile,  
Hey girl, just be carefree, I’ll protect you from behind.  

When night falls,  
I’ll steal your heart, let you down,  
Into my arms that are ready to catch you (To catch you, baby, baby).  
Baby girl, baby girl, please always smile,  
Hey girl, just be carefree when we’re together.  

[Outro]  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah,  
No-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah,  
Ah-whoo-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh.
