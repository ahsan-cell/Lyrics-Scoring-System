**Translated Lyrics:**

The pain lingers as you drift away,  
Along this empty road, it's just me here, aching to erase all the passion of the days gone by.  

A love song has died,  
Yet your eyes still bear the weight of fatigue,  
Love so fragile like a sunset fading, quickly dissolving into the night, never to see dawn again.  

This love now fades, leaving only sad memories, longing for the words unspoken.  
The sunset vanishes, leaving my heart burning in the dark night.  
I remember you, your gaze lost in thought,  
Tears fall in indifference,  
Heartbroken, sinking into dreams.  

Alone, I stumble through a despairing afternoon, hoping to reach paradise,  
Drowning deep in the darkness, tears falling in haste.  
In the distance, only desolation remains,  
Exhausted, my mind is in turmoil,  
How pitiful this shattered love has become.
