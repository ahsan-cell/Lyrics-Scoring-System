**Translated Lyrics:**

Returning to your city  
There’s a wave of emotion in my longing  
Still just like before  
Every corner greets me like a friend  
Full of countless meanings  

I’m swept away by nostalgia  
When we often spent time together  
Enjoying the atmosphere  
Of Jogja  

At the crossroads, my steps come to a halt  
The bustling street vendors  
Offering delicious local dishes  
People sitting cross-legged  

Street musicians begin to play  
As my sorrow over losing you rises  
I lament alone  
Swallowed by the roar of your city...  

**Chorus:**  
Though now you’re gone and won’t return  
Your city still brings forth your eternal smile  
Allow me to always come back again  
When my heart starts to feel lonely and unhealed
