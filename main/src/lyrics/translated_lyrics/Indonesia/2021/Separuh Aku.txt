**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
And it happens again  
An old story that repeats itself  
You’re hurt again  
From the complicated love you’re living

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want you to feel  
You understand, I understand you  
I want you to realize  
Your love is not for him

[Chorus]  
Hear my lament  
This voice of my heart calls your name  
Because half of me  
Is you

[Verse 2]  
I’m here  
Understand that you’re never alone  
Because I’m always  
By your side when you fall

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want you to feel  
You understand, I understand you  
I want you to comprehend  
Your love is not for him

[Chorus]  
Hear my lament  
This voice of my heart calls your name  
Because half of me  
Is you

[Outro]  
Hear my lament  
This voice of my heart calls your name  
Because half of me  
Touches your sorrow  
All your wounds have become mine  
Because half of me  
Is you
