**Translated Lyrics:**

Just coming and going, with no heart involved

You came, and everything felt different  
Why is it like this? What has happened?

Never before  
I never expected this

**Chorus:**

I admit I’m playing with hearts (I’m playing with hearts, 2x)  
I can’t deny it  
I’m playing with hearts

With you, I feel  
What I’ve never felt before  
My search has ended  
Because I’ve found you

**Back to Chorus:** (2x)

I’m playing with hearts… I’m playing with hearts  
I’m playing with hearts… I’m playing with hearts
