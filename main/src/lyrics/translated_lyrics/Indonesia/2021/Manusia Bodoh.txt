**Translated Lyrics:**

Once it felt beautiful  
I don’t want to forget  
Always being affectionate  
Is a sweet memory  

**[Pre-Chorus 1]**  
There’s nothing wrong  
Just me, a foolish human  
Letting all of this play with me  
Over and over again  

**[Chorus 1]**  
Trying to hold on with all my heart  
Like a rock battered by the waves  
Living life in a gentle lull  
Surrendering pure love to fate  

**[Verse 2]**  
Unavoidably, your behavior  
Makes me desperate  
Sometimes this common sense  
Isn’t enough to hold it back  

**[Pre-Chorus 2]**  
Only pain  
That always comes to mock me  
You, my soulmate  
Cruelly dance beautifully over my tears  

**[Chorus 2]**  
Trying to hold on with all my heart  
Like a rock battered by the waves  
Living life in a gentle lull  
Surrendering pure love to fate  
But until when must I  
Bear this curse of love?  

**[Bridge]**  
Every story must have an end  
That must be faced  
So does the end of this tale  
I believe it will be beautiful  

**[Chorus 3]**  
Trying to hold on with all my heart  
Like a rock battered by the waves  
Living life in a gentle lull  
Surrendering pure love to fate  
But until when must I  
Bear this curse of love?  
Dwelling within my heart
