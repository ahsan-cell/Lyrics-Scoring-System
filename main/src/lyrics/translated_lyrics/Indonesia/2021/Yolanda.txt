**Translated Lyrics:**

I wish it were a declaration of love  
Romantic, without worrying about the details  
That puts a stop to what I feel now in torrents  
I love you  
I love you  
Eternally, I love you  

If you were to leave me, I wouldn’t die  
If I must die, I want it to be with you  
My loneliness feels accompanied  
That’s why sometimes I know I need  
Your hand  
Your hand  
Eternally, your hand  

When I saw you, I knew it was true  
This fear of being exposed  
You strip me bare with seven reasons  
You open my heart whenever you fill me  
With love  
With love  
Eternally, with love  

If I ever feel defeated  
I give up seeing the sun each morning  
Praying the creed you taught me  
I look at your face and say at the window  
Yolanda  
Yolanda  
Eternally, Yolanda  
Yolanda  
Eternally, Yolanda  
Eternally, Yolanda
