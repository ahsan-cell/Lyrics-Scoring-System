**Translated Lyrics:**

Friend, I truly don’t understand  
How all of this could happen  
After that introduction  
I was swept away  
I really can’t help it  
Longing for her  
Missing her  

[Verse 2]  
I know she belongs to you, my dear  
Like the flower you chose  
But my heart and hers  
Signal a feeling  
Wanting to pick, to weave  
To create an eternal bond  
Longing for her  
Missing her  

[Chorus]  
Oh friend, forgive me for loving her  
I didn’t mean to make you feel so insignificant  
Oh friend, forgive me for loving her  
I didn’t mean to make you feel so insignificant  

[Verse 3]  
Trying to hold back that overwhelming feeling  
It weighs down my troubled soul  
It turns out my life and hers are bound by sincere feelings  
It won’t diminish my embrace and her longing  
Longing for her  
Missing her  

[Chorus]  
Oh friend, forgive me for loving her  
I didn’t mean to make you feel so insignificant  
Oh friend, forgive me for loving her  
I didn’t mean to make you feel so insignificant
