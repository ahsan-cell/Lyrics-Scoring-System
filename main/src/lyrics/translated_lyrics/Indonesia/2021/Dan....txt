**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
And...  
When tomorrow comes, return again  
Just like before, where you could joke around  
And...  
Slowly you too, forget about me  
Your nightmare  
Where I’ve planted sharp thorns  
You cry, crying sadly  
Forgive me...

[Verse 2]  
And...  
It’s not my intention, it’s not what I want  
To hurt you, do you realize you’re here and I’m hurt too?  
Forgetting you, pushing you aside  
Forgive me

[Chorus]  
Just forget about me  
If that can make you shine again  
And glow like in the old days  
Feel free to curse me  
If that can make you shine again  
And glow like in the old days

[Verse 3]  
And...  
It’s not my intention, it’s not what I want  
To hurt you, do you realize you’re here and I’m hurt too?  
Forgetting you, pushing you aside  
Forgive me

[Chorus]  
Just forget about me  
If that can make you shine again  
And glow like in the old days  
Feel free to curse me  
If that can make you shine again  
And glow like in the old days

[Chorus]  
Just forget about me  
If that can make you shine again  
And glow like in the old days  
Feel free to curse me  
If that can make you shine again  
And glow like in the old days
