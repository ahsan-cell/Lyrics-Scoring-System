**Translated Lyrics:**

I stand here in silence, waiting for news from you  
Not long after that, I heard the rumors too  
I saw you with him at that moment  
Hand in hand, you blushed shyly

I can't believe what has happened  
But this is real, no need to feel downhearted  
Maybe this is the fate I must endure  
You found the courage to turn your heart away

Years have passed, the time we've shared  
So easily, you erased our history laid bare  
Nature bears witness to love blocked by wealth  
It turns out it happened; I thought it was just an illusion

Go on, my love, never come back again  
I don't need empty words in this world  
Let this feeling fade away on its own  
I will walk on, even without needing to run

**(CHORUS)**  
Just go away... (Just go away)  
Don't ever come back...  
And let me... (And let me)  
Be alone here...  
Just go away... (Just go away)  
Don't ever come back...  
And let me... (And let me)  
Be alone here...

On a Sunday morning, you once made a promise  
To always be together, wherever I go  
But now you break that vow  
Now that love has drifted further away

We went through all the stories about us  
From joy to sorrow and pain  
We would be happy when we were together  
But now that tale has long since faded

Maybe he’s more established and also more handsome  
If you’re with me, you should be able to withstand  
If you can’t take it, then go, I won’t hold you back  
Let me accept all that has come to pass

The flower you picked is now wilting away  
You let it lie like a blanket of dust  
Now only remains a story, just a story  
You and I will never be able to unite again

**(CHORUS)**  
Just go away... (Just go away)  
Don't ever come back...  
And let me... (And let me)  
Be alone here...  
Just go away... (Just go away)  
Don't ever come back...  
And let me... (And let me)  
Be alone here...
