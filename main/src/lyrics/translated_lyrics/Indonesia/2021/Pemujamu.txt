**Translated Lyrics:**

Such a great sin  
To love so deeply  
Those eyes have successfully hypnotized me  
Entangling my soul's desire  
Trapping me in beauty  
I feel like tonight  
I want to kiss you until I’m weak  
I feel like tonight  
I want to hold you until I fall asleep  

You are like a symbol of the universe  
And I am your worshiper  
Every moment, I kneel before you  
You hold all my life  
Emerging from suffering  
Towards divine peace  

I feel like tonight  
I want to kiss you until I’m weak  
I feel like tonight  
I want to hold you until I fall asleep  

God, please awaken me soon  
From all  
The influence of this deadly love spell  
I have for her  

I feel like tonight  
I want to kiss you until I’m weak  
I feel like tonight  
I want to hold you until I fall asleep  

I want this not to be just a mere dream  
I want this to be the most beautiful sin of my life.
