**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's time for me to speak  
Maybe for the last time  
Let go of everything  
I believe this is the moment  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Perhaps you're not the same as before  
Perhaps those feelings have faded away  

[Chorus]  
And maybe someday  
We will meet again  
One request, please don't try  
To ask again  
The feelings I left behind  
Are like yesterday  
When everything was here  

[Verse 2]  
And if your heart is pondering  
Awake from your dreams  
Open your heart like before  
To the stories we shared  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Perhaps you're not the same as before  
Perhaps those feelings have faded away  

[Chorus]  
And maybe someday  
We will meet again  
One request, please don't try  
To ask again  
The feelings I left behind  
Are like yesterday  
When everything was here  

[Instrumental]  

[Chorus]  
And maybe someday  
We will meet again  
One request, please don't try  
To ask again  
The feelings I left behind  
Are like yesterday  
When everything was here  

[Outro]  
No need to ask again  
Keep it to yourself  
All the regrets you seek  
All the feelings you gave
