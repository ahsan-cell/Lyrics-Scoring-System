**Translated Lyrics:**

Hey hey, which one will you choose? Chocolate  
Look inside the arranged chocolate box  
Like sparkling jewels  
Hey hey, which one will you choose? Chocolate  
Only one holds a message from me  
For you  

[Verse 1]  
When it melts in your mouth  
My feelings will be conveyed  
Because I'm shy  
I can't express it in words  
Like a recipe that's very secret  
Only understood by those who care  
A confession of love so  
It goes unnoticed by those around me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Love, even though it's so delightful  
Why does this chest feel so constricted?  
Sweet, yet a little bitter  

[Chorus]  
Hey, how about this? Chocolate  
Feel the heartbeat that’s racing  
A gift from romance  
Hey, how about this? Chocolate  
Though they look the same, inside they're so different  
I love you  

[Verse 2]  
Of course, I surely know your taste well  
Always adding milk and sugar to your coffee  
Always like a child, you can't eat anything too bitter  
And even though I understand, I want you to choose seriously  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Just with the amount of cocoa in it  
You’ll surely want to close your eyes  
Understand the bitterness  

[Chorus]  
Hey hey, which one will you choose? Chocolate  
Look inside the arranged chocolate box  
Like sparkling jewels  
Hey hey, which one will you choose? Chocolate  
Only one holds a message from me  
For you  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Hey hey, which one will you choose? Chocolate  
From the start, you must have known, right?  
The one at the end  
Hey hey, which one will you choose? Chocolate  
Not just sweet, try testing me  
With a racing heart  

[Outro]  
Bitter chocolate means I love you
