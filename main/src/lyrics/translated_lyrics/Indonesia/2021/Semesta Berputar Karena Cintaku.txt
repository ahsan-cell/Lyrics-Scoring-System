**Translated Lyrics:**

To assure yourself  
That no one loves you more  
Than I do, oh...

A gentle breeze blows from my love  
Heavy rain falls because of my love  
The ocean waves for my love  
The universe spins because of my love  

Open the window of your soul's room  
Let the stuffy night air escape
