**Translated Lyrics:**

Bouncing and jumping,  
People try to forget  
All the failures of love and desire,  
Swallowing the bitterness of fate  
From dark bottles.

Flashes of colorful lights  
Etch sorrow right in the chest.  
With all my strength, I remember you—  
Your love, your longing, your hopes,  
Rising and falling like the waves of the southern sea.

Oh, it feels like a blink of an eye,  
On the bed, I’m ambushed by pity.  
The ocean of fiery suffering blazes,  
Almost everywhere.  
Murmuring softly, the song of my childhood comes forth:

The rain is heavy,  
The flood is great,  
I can’t see it like this.  

(Note: The last lines are a traditional expression that reflects the overwhelming nature of emotions and experiences, akin to feeling lost in a storm.)
