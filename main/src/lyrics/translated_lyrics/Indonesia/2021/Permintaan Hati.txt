**Translated Lyrics:**

The Beauty of Waiting

The doubts of a restless heart are spoken,  
Blocked by the certainty of love.  

I am lost,  
I am lost.  

The fog of night lifts, revealing hope,  
That holds a million owners.  
I feel the longing of a troubled heart,  
Crushed by the certainty of love.  

Listen to the plea of a heart tormented by silence,  
And give meaning to my life,  
That is shattered, that is released.  
Your embrace, with you and without you, I am always lost.  

I am lost,  
I am lost.  

The fog of night lifts, revealing hope,  
That holds a million owners.  
I feel the longing of a troubled heart,  
Crushed by the certainty of love.  

Listen to the plea of a heart tormented by silence,  
And give meaning to my life,  
That is shattered, that is released.  
Your embrace, with you and without you, I am always lost.  
With you and without you, I am always lost.  

Listen to the plea of a heart tormented by silence,  
And give meaning to my life,  
That is shattered, that is released.  
Your embrace, with you and without you, I am always lost.  
With you and without you, I am always lost.
