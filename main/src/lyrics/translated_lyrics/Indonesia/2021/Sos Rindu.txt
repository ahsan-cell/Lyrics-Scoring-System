**Translated Lyrics:**

Projects and paths  
From where I've been  
Of what I learned and what I've done  

How to absorb the routes  
That made me happy  
Even the bad moments  
Full of feelings, I desired  

I never let myself be carried away  
By the time that has passed  
Fall, rise, move forward  
Follow the link in the chain  

The serpent tried to lead me  
Down the wrong path  
But in this garden of life  
I gather roses without thorns  

(Chorus)  
Music  
Throughout my life  
It’s always there  
No blah blah blah  
A diva's narrative  
For love, I will take you  
Lyricist floats adrift  
On the sound line  
That changes people's lives  

Bad things, good things  
Happen all the time  
Street literature, what goes on  
I’m aware  

The track narrates the moment  
Many against the wind  
Recording what they’re going through  

Many are just swaying  
Not even knowing what they’re saying  
Some crazy ones today  
Even try to fool me  

Hahaha  
Just laughing to endure  
But let it be  
Who am I to judge?  

I follow my philosophy  
For fashion  
Does not shape me
