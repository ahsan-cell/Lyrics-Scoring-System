**Translated Lyrics:**

In the endless expanse  
Can I  
Hear you?  

Buried in emotions  
Unable to hide  
Me and my breath  
Longing for you.  

I’m down here  
Light up the one who’s lonely  
And I know for sure  
You’re by my side.  

In my life  
My solitude.  

I remember, I recall  
Bound by your promise  
Just for a moment I stand  
I do it with all my heart.  
I care, I care  
As day turns into night  
My sadness has no meaning  
If you are the support of my heart  
You are the support of my heart  
Support of my heart.  

Is this what you want?  
Is this truly your path?  
Only you am I aiming for  
Hold my hand tightly  
Guide my steps  
I’m lost without you  
In the darkness  
Of my night.
