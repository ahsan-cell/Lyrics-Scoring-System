Here’s the English translation of the lyrics you provided:

---

I want to fly high  
Like an eagle  
Through day and night  
Piercing the clouds  

* :  
This is my hand for you to hold  
This is my body for you to embrace  
These are my lips for you to kiss  
But you cannot possess me... I  

Chorus:  
You don’t need to keep crying over my departure  
Tears won’t call me back  
To return...  

I am the dreams - dreams that are crossing  
The maiden who plays with feelings  

Back to *, Chorus:  
(Instrumental)  
Back to *, Chorus: (2x)  

I am the dreams - dreams, without meaning  
I want to fly high like an eagle  
(Fade Out)
