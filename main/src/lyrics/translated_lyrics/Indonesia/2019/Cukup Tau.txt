**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s truly in vain  
To love him, yet not be loved back  
His body language seems to say  
He doesn’t love me and doesn’t like me  
I start to think  
I’m heartbroken and beginning to feel

[Chorus]  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to approach you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling

[Verse 2]  
His body language seems to say  
He doesn’t love me and doesn’t like me  
I start to think  
I’m heartbroken and beginning to feel

[Chorus]  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to approach you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling

[Interlude]

[Chorus]  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to approach you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to approach you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling
