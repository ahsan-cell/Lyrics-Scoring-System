**Translated Lyrics:**

Admiring your beauty, oh lovely one  
I can no longer find the words to say  
My silence is captivated  

And if one day you become mine  
I will never let you go, oh my love  
And if time allows me to wait  
For you  

I feel I've fallen in love  
At first sight  
It's hard for me to  
Stop admiring her  

As time goes by  
Finally, we meet  
Oh, I blush with shyness  
Seeing your charming ways  

And if one day you become mine  
I will never let you go, oh my love  
And if time allows me to wait  
For you  

I feel I've fallen in love  
At first sight  
It's hard for me to  
Stop admiring her  

Oh God, please help me  
To make her mine  
My darling, my love, oh my sweetheart  
She's all that I need  

And when we are together  
I will cherish you forever  
Please accept my love  
Yeah yeah yeah  

Summertime, it ain't summertime  
If I don't have you as mine, but you're always on my mind  
In the magazine, you showed up, baby girl, your beauty blows my mind  
Your personality is calm and friendly  
The kind of girl I would love to be with me  
Once I start, no, I won't fall back  
Here's my cellphone number, so please call back  

I feel I've fallen in love  
At first sight  
It's hard for me to  
Stop admiring her  

Oh God, please help me  
To make her mine  
My darling, my love, oh my sweetheart  
She's all that I need
