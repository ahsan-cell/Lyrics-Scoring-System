**Translated Lyrics:**

Only to love each other  
Perhaps we are destined to be together  
We weave affection, intertwining love  

In your embrace  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love  

Together with you  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love  

You and I were created by time  
Only to love each other  
Perhaps we are destined to be together  
We weave affection, intertwining love  

In your embrace  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love  

Together with you  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love  

I never imagined  
That you would leave me  
My heart would shatter  
My hopes would vanish, my dear  

In your embrace  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love  

In your embrace  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love  

Together with you  
You teach me what comfort means  
The perfection of love
