**Translated Lyrics:**

Always present as if you don't want to disappear  
From me, oh from me  

It won't be easy for me to forget  
Everything that has happened  
Between you and me  
Between the two of us  

Now there's no news coming from you  
Now you've vanished far from me  
All that's left are stories between you and me  

But one thing you need to know  
The fire of my love for you never goes out  
Never goes out  

It won't be easy for me to forget  
Everything that has happened  
Between you and me  
Between the two of us  

Now there's no news coming from you  
Now you've vanished far from me  
All that's left are stories between you and me  

But one thing you need to know  
The fire of my love for you never goes out  
The fire of my love for you, whoa oh yeah  

Now there's no news coming from you  
Now you've vanished far from me  
All that's left are stories between you and me  

But one thing you need to know  
The fire of my love for you never goes out, never goes out
