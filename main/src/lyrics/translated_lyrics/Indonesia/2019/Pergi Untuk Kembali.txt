**Translated Lyrics:**

Even though the sky that night  
Was bathed in starlight  
The moon shone bright, how beautiful it was  
Yet it adds to the pain, oh-oh-oh  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I will go (I will go)  
Leaving you behind  
Winding through my life's path  
Do not worry  
And do not doubt  
Just give me a smile  

**[Chorus]**  
Goodbye, my love  
Until we meet again  
I’ll be gone but not for long  
Just a little while  
I will return again  
As long as you keep waiting, yeah  

**[Verse 2]**  
I will go (I will go)  
Leaving you behind  
Winding through my life's path  
Do not worry (Don’t)  
And do not doubt  
Just give me a smile (Uh-uh)  

**[Chorus]**  
Goodbye, my love  
Until we meet again (Uh-uh)  
I’ll be gone but not for long (Uh-uh)  
Just a little while  
I will return again  
As long as you keep waiting  

**[Interlude]**  
Waiting (Uh-oh)  
I’ll be gone but not for long  
No  
No, no, uh-uh  
Oh, no, waiting  
As long as you keep waiting, uh-wo-ho  
As long as you keep waiting  

**[Outro]**  
Waiting  
Waiting, uh-oh  
Uh-uh, no, oh, waiting (Uh, waiting)  
Uh, waiting  
Huh-uh-uh-uh
