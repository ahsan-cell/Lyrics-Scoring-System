**Translated Lyrics:**

When I hear that  
You’re no longer with him  
Questions arise in my mind  
Is there still a place for him  
In your heart?  
Or is this my moment to find a spot in your heart?

[Refrain: Neida]  
But are you ready to fall in love again?

[Chorus: Neida]  
Though these lips don’t speak,  
It doesn’t mean I don’t feel.  
There’s something different between us,  
And I can’t let you slip away,  
Just because I can’t find the words  
To say that I want you here  
In my life.

[Verse 2: Ilham]  
Now I’m no longer with her,  
There’s no more feeling left  
Between me and her.  
Are you ready to reign  
In my heart, dear?  
Because this is the right time  
To find a place in my heart.

[Refrain: Ilham]  
But are you ready to fall in love again?

[Chorus: Ilham]  
Though these lips don’t speak,  
It doesn’t mean I don’t feel.  
There’s something different between us,  
And I can’t let you slip away,  
Just because I can’t find the words  
To say that I want you here  
In my life.

[Bridge: Neida, Neida & Ilham]  
Just think it over until there’s no doubt,  
So my path is smooth  
As I step towards your heart.  
Just think it over until there’s no doubt,  
So my path is smooth  
As I step towards your heart.

[Refrain: Neida & Ilham]  
Are you ready to fall in love again?

[Chorus: Neida & Ilham, Neida, Ilham]  
Though these lips don’t speak,  
It doesn’t mean I don’t feel.  
There’s something different between us,  
And I can’t let you slip away,  
Just because I can’t find the words  
To say that I want you here.  
Though these lips don’t speak (Ooh-ooh),  
It doesn’t mean I don’t feel.  
There’s something different between us,  
And I can’t let you slip away,  
Just because I can’t find the words  
To say that I want you here  
In my life.

[Post-Chorus: Neida & Ilham]  
If you fall in love, say it out loud,  
Don’t let it go to waste.  
If you fall in love, say it out loud,  
Don’t let it go to waste.  
If you fall in love, say it out loud,  
Don’t let it go to waste.

[Refrain: Neida & Ilham]  
Are you ready to fall in love again?
