**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Yura Yunita]  
In the end, I gazed into your beautiful eyes  
Underneath the stars  
My heart is torn  
Between love and secrets  
I love you  
But you belong to my friend  
The dilemma of my heart  
If only I could speak honestly  

[Chorus: Yura Yunita]  
Don't choose him  
Choose me, who can love you more than he does  
I don't want to take you away from my friend  
But you know  
Love cannot, cannot be blamed  

[Verse 2: Glenn Fredly]  
I love you  
But you belong to my friend  
The dilemma of my heart  
If only I could speak honestly  

[Chorus: Glenn Fredly]  
Don't choose him  
Choose me, who can love you more than he does  
I don't want to take you away from my friend  
But you know  
Love cannot, cannot be blamed  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus: Yura Yunita, Glenn Fredly, Both]  
Don't (Don't) choose him (Choose him)  
Choose me (Choose me) who can love you more than he does  
(Who can love you more than he does)  
I don't want to take you away from my friend  
But you know  
Love cannot, cannot be blamed  

[Outro: Yura Yunita & Glenn Fredly]  
It cannot be blamed  
It cannot be blamed
