**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
If your money alone could  
Move my world,  
Then your love surely could  
Change the course of my life.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Just once, I felt  
How painful it is to lose you.  
You are irreplaceable, the one I always wait for,  
I won’t let you go again.  

[Chorus]  
Hold my hand,  
Together we fall in love, oh,  
For the second time,  
With the same one, oh,  
Whoa, oh.  

[Verse 2]  
If your smile alone could  
Steal my heartbeat,  
Then your embrace could  
Sweep away my whole heart.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Just once, I felt  
How painful it is to lose you.  
You are irreplaceable, the one I always wait for,  
I won’t let you go again.  

[Chorus]  
Hold my hand,  
Together we fall in love, oh,  
For the second time,  
With the same one,  
Oh-ooh.  

[Bridge]  
Drop your heart (Ha)  
Without a care,  
As we come together again for the second time.  

[Chorus]  
Hold my hand,  
Together we fall in love, oh,  
For the second time,  
With the same one,  
Just as beautiful.  
Hold my hand,  
Together we fall in love, ah,  
For the second time,  
With the same one,  
Just as beautiful.
