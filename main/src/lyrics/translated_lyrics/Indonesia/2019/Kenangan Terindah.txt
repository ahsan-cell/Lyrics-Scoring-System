**Translated Lyrics:**

I am vulnerable because  
Of the love that has vanished from you  
That once lifted me high  

As long as my eyes are open  
Until my heart stops beating  
For as long as that,  
I can still remember you  

From you, I found my life  
To me, you are true love  

If what is written for me  
Is what’s best for you  
I will make you a memory  
The most beautiful in my life  
But it won’t be easy for me  
To leave behind the traces of my life  
That have been eternally etched  

As the most beautiful memory  

If what is written for me  
Is what’s best for you  
I will make you a memory  
The most beautiful in my life  
But it won’t be easy for me  
To leave behind the traces of my life  
That have been eternally etched  
As the most beautiful memory
