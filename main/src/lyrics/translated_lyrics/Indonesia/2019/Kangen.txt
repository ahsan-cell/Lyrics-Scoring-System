**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I’ve read your letter, and I understand  
How much you long for my presence  
In your days, together again  

[Verse 2]  
You ask me  
When I will return again  
You say you can’t resist  
The turmoil in your heart  
That burns, holding back feelings  
Our meeting later when you’re by my side  

[Chorus]  
All your words of longing make me feel so powerless  
Holding back the desire to meet  
Trust me, I miss you too  
I will come home  
Releasing all the pent-up longing  

[Verse 3]  
You wrote to me, sweet words of love in your letter  
You told me, "Right now, I want the warmth of your embrace"  
And the gentle caress of your love  
I will never forget those moments spent with you  

[Chorus]  
All your words of longing make me feel so powerless  
Holding back the desire to meet  
Trust me, I miss you too  
I will come home  
Releasing all the pent-up longing  

[Bridge]  
Don’t say love  
It adds to the burden of feelings  
Just keep your sadness to yourself  
I will come  

[Instrumental]  

[Chorus]  
All your words of longing make me feel so powerless  
Holding back the desire to meet  
Trust me, I miss you too  
I will come home  
Releasing all the pent-up longing
