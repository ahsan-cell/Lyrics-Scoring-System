**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Only with you do I share  
Only you truly understand  
The restlessness in my heart  
That has been uncertain all this time  

[Verse 2]  
There’s no doubt in my heart  
Make sure I become your love  
As time has passed by  
Maybe you are the last for me, oh  

[Chorus]  
I will do everything for you  
I will give you all my love  
Please don’t ever change  
In loving and understanding me  

[Verse 3]  
Hold my hand, grip my fingers  
Feel all the warmth of my being  
Flowing sincerely for your love  
There’s no one else in my heart  

[Chorus]  
I will do everything for you  
I will give you all my love  
Please don’t ever change  
In loving and understanding me  
I will do everything for you  
I will give you all my love  
Please don’t ever change  
In loving and understanding me  

[Bridge]  
This is my love, I give it to you  
With all my heart, I offer it to you  

[Chorus]  
I will do everything for you  
I will give you all my love  
Oh, I will do it for you  
I will give you all my love  
Please don’t ever change  
In loving and understanding me  
I will do everything for you  
I will give you all my love  
Please don’t ever change  
In loving and understanding me  
In loving and understanding me  
In loving, understanding me  

[Outro]  
And understanding me
