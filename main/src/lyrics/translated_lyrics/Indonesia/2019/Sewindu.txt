**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's been eight years I've been by your side  
Here every morning, throughout your day  
It’s impossible that you don’t know  
That I’ve kept these feelings hidden for so long  
Every morning I wait by the door  
Preparing my best smile to brighten your day  
It’s enough for me to see you smile sweetly  
In every morning, afternoon, and night of yours  

[Pre-Chorus]  
For a moment he comes, charming like a prince  
And gives you hope, sweet talk of love in the future  
And you forget me, all my efforts  
All our mornings, all our nights  

[Chorus]  
Oh, I will no longer wait for you by the door  
And there will be no more sweet words to woo you  

[Verse 2]  
Every morning I wait by the door  
Preparing my best smile to brighten your day  
It’s enough for me to see you smile sweetly  
In every morning, afternoon, and night of yours  

[Pre-Chorus]  
For a moment he comes, charming like a prince  
And gives you hope, sweet talk of love in the future  
You forget me, all my efforts  
All our mornings, all our nights  

[Chorus]  
Oh, I will no longer wait for you by the door  
And there will be no more sweet words to woo you  
Oh, I will no longer wait for you by the door  
And there will be no more sweet words to woo you  

[Bridge]  
Honestly, it really hurts in my heart  
When now it’s clear you’ve chosen him  
I won’t be this foolish anymore  
Lost in dreams without a purpose  

[Chorus]  
Oh, I will no longer wait for you by the door  
And there will be no more sweet words to woo you  
Oh, I will no longer wait for you by the door  
And there will be no more sweet words to woo you
