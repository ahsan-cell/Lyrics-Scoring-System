**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
All my heart always worships you  
I dedicate my whole soul to you  
With all my love, I long for you  
A complete passion burns in my heart  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Like the light of your presence in my world  
Like thousands of stars piercing my heart  

[Chorus]  
You make me feel  
The beauty of falling in love  
The beauty of being loved  
When you become mine  
Oh, I will never let you go  
You, oh my love  
Keep blooming  
In the depths of my heart  

[Interlude]  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Like the light of your presence in my world  
Like thousands of stars piercing my heart  

[Chorus]  
You make me feel  
The beauty of falling in love  
The beauty of being loved  
When you become mine  
Oh, I will never let you go  
You, oh my love  
Keep blooming  
In the depths of my heart  
You make me feel  
The beauty of falling in love  
The beauty of being loved  
When you become mine  
Oh, I will never let you go  
You, oh my love  
Keep blooming  
In the depths of my heart  

[Outro]  
You make me feel  
The beauty of falling in love  
The beauty of being loved  
When you become mine  
When you become mine
