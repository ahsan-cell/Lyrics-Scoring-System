**Translated Lyrics:**

I've been alone for so long  
In these silent steps  
I never thought that in the end  
You wouldn't be by my side  

[Chorus]  
Even as time comes  
And passes until you can no longer endure  
Nothing will be able to change me  
Only you reside in my heart  
Only you  
Can make me fall and love  
You're not just beautiful  
You cannot be replaced  

[Verse 2]  
I never expected that in the end  
Your promise and mine would be challenged  

[Chorus]  
Even as time comes  
And passes until you can no longer endure  
Nothing will be able to change me  
Only you reside in my heart  
Only you  
Can make me fall and love  
You're not just beautiful  
You cannot be replaced  
You cannot be replaced
