**Translated Lyrics:**

Bring the coolness that has long been absent,  
Wipe away my soul's thirst for true love.  

* How perfect you are in the eyes of my heart,  
I've never felt peace as serene as when I'm with you.  
No one could ever take your place.  

**Chorus:**  
You make me feel amazing,  
Because of your sincere love.  
I feel so special,  
Just because, just because of love.  
You give yourself to me completely,  
Making me always feel significant.  

Now I feel incredible,  
Because you make me stronger.  
My heart races fast,  
All burdens can be overcome.  
Is this true love?  

I soar, flying, swimming in the clouds,  
We won't let go or fall now.  
Love, oh love, we will keep loving.
