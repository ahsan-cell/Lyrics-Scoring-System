**Translated Lyrics:**

The night calls to me, and is it wrong for my feet to follow  
As I walk, watch me and gaze as you judge me  
The devil says that door cannot be crossed  
I admit, when I challenge the dust  
Release the confusion, and quickly I raise the gun  
To blow apart the sky that has been acting up  
Following my heart's whims, dark thoughts about my goodness  
I confine all my promises, sinking into my soul  
Help, help, stop me from the shadows of my steps  
You mock me, disturbing me as if my face  
Is too filthy and dirty, you don’t clean your glass  
My hand reaches out to help while yours slithers in front of me  
This isn’t rap, but a spell  
To summon a spirit to clear my path  
Under the bright light, passing by empty tables  
That are vacant without guests, yet the soul I do not know  
Crossing the asphalt that it has memorized  
Awkward steps reaching across, continuing to weave  
Words and words that fly like Michael  
This curse reveals the fangs of a viper  
Tyson beats this, making ears bleed  
My focus is directed only in one way  
Adding a little salt to the night  
And my popular opinion is angry at God  
The church remains silent as I pass by  
The wild pack thinks I’m disturbed  
In reality, I’m tense holding an idea  
That’s stretching life on the edge of a fragile cliff  
Ah, everyone is clever enough to be a judge  
Throwing thorny words like praise at a feast  
The night dissolves seduction, poison for sleeping  
A woman with sad eyes is shepherded and nursed  
Forget the calm bordello, I’m tracing  
From tent to tent, various dishes served  
Foamy coffee, truly I have given thanks  
And the super visit that I’ve been grappling with  
Clearly, we are criminals for killing  
A beautiful view with a shabby appearance  
Domino in hand to distract from what’s in mind  
Also all the numbers that exceed the apocalypse  
Ambulance sirens running like Usain  
Trying to avoid the end with a string of prayers  
My problem now is shame as I unravel  
Aware of the worms in the ground tasked to decompose.
