**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Like a river that knows no shame,  
Flowing even when threatened to dry,  
Then your feet step towards my home,  
Half-glancing, trying to charm.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What do you desire  
From my smile, oh Sir?

[Chorus]  
You love to paint stars for me,  
Truly skilled are your hands in mending a heart  
That was nearly dead.  
I will place warmth in the midst of our sorrow,  
Don’t let me go back  
To a home that isn’t yours.

[Post-Chorus]  
Du-du-du  
Ah-du-du-du-du-oh

[Verse 2]  
Talking about the whole world,  
Slowly approaching whispers of love,  
Making me drowsy,  
Into the charm of a soul so beautiful.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What do you desire  
From my smile, oh Sir?

[Chorus]  
You love to paint stars for me,  
Truly skilled are your hands in mending a heart  
That was nearly dead.  
I will place warmth in the midst of our sorrow,  
Don’t let me go back  
To a home that isn’t yours.

[Bridge]  
If I could explore the skies,  
I would pluck a rainbow to color your day.  
Don’t worry, I’m still here,  
Don’t worry, I’m still here.

[Bridge]  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Chorus]  
You love to paint stars for me,  
Truly skilled are your hands in mending a heart  
That was nearly dead.  
I will place warmth in the midst of our sorrow,  

[Outro]  
I will invite you to stay here.
