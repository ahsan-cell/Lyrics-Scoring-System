**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
My friend tells me  
That I will be okay  
But in reality, it’s hard for me  
To heal from the past  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It started with a spark  
But ended up all muddled  

[Chorus]  
Do you know the pain that won’t heal?  
Before I could recover, I was stabbed again  
Sick of it  
I’m sick of it  
They say love is as deep as the ocean  
But it’s a lie, we ended up here too  
Sick of it  
I’m sick of it  

[Verse 2]  
Crossing the sea  
Getting through thorny weeds  
Metaphors full of meaning about love  
No longer have any effect  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It started with a spark  
But ended up all muddled  

[Chorus]  
Do you know the pain that won’t heal?  
Before I could recover, I was stabbed again  
Sick of it  
I’m sick of it  
They say love is as deep as the ocean  
But it’s a lie, we ended up here too  
Sick of it  
I’m sick of it  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Do you know the pain that won’t heal?  
Before I could recover, I was stabbed again  
Sick of it  
I’m sick of it  
They say love is as deep as the ocean  
But it’s a lie, we ended up here too  
Sick of it  
I’m sick of it  

[Outro]  
If it all ends here too  
I’m sick of it  
I’m sick of it
