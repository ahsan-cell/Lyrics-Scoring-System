**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In every moment that I've lived through  
Overflowing with stories that can't be replaced  
The evening begins to turn blue, waiting for what has passed  
Tears of longing interrupt the sorrow of missing you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If I feel lonely  
Come back to where I wait  
Before time demands an end  

(Ha-a, o-oo)  
(Ha-a, o-oo)  
(Ha-a, o-oo)  
(Ha-a, o-oo)  

[Chorus]  
Tell me how to forget you  
Like you taught me to grow up  
Tell me how to let you go  
Like you taught me to be happy  

[Interlude]  
Let me step aside if you will return  
And assure me that you've found what you seek  
Allow me to hate the one who replaces you  
And assure me that you've found what you seek  

[Chorus]  
Tell me how to forget you  
Like you taught me to grow up  
Tell me how to let you go  
Like you taught me to be happy  
Tell me how to forget you  
Like you taught me to grow up  
Tell me how to let you go  
Like you taught me to always be perfect
