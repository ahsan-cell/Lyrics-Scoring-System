**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Black and white photo sheets  
I try to remember the color of your clothes back then  
The first time in my life  
Another person embraced me  

[Verse 2]  
Black and white photo sheets  
I try to recall the scent of home that afternoon  
Colorful balloon chocolate cake  
The party for my birthday  

[Chorus]  
Wherever you are  
I send my thanks  
For the colors in my life and all the beautiful memories  
You painted me  

[Verse 3]  
Black and white photo sheets  
I remember the night I counted the stars  
When my eyes struggled to sleep  
Your voice lulled me to rest  

[Chorus]  
Wherever you are  
I send my thanks  
For the colors in my life and all the beautiful memories  
You painted me  

[Bridge]  
We never know how long we have  
Given this time  
If I leave first, donâ€™t forget me  
This is a song for you  
An expression of my gratitude  

[Outro]  
Monochrome black and white sheets  
I try to remember color by color in my life  
I would never know love  
If not for your kind heart
