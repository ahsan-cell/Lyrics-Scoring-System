**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Until this moment, I never thought  
I would give my heart to someone like you  
If only from the start, I hadn’t convinced myself  
That perfect words aren’t as good as I believed  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If I had known it would all be in vain  
I wouldn’t have accepted your fleeting love  

[Chorus]  
What about me, who has fallen for you?  
You came and gave me hope, then left and disappeared  
You never considered how my heart shattered because of you  
Without a word of reason, you left without saying goodbye  
I won’t accept your fleeting love  

[Verse 2]  
If only from the start, I hadn’t convinced myself  
That perfect words aren’t as good as I believed  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If I had known it would all be in vain  
I wouldn’t have accepted your fleeting love  

[Chorus]  
What about me, who has fallen for you?  
You came and gave me hope, then left and disappeared  
You never considered how my heart shattered because of you  
Without a word of reason, you left without saying goodbye  
I won’t accept your fleeting love  

[Bridge]  
Damn, I met with a false love  
Deceived by your words and ways  
As if my love (my love)  
Was it satisfying for you to trick me?  

[Chorus]  
What about me, who has fallen for you? (For you)  
You came and gave me hope, then left and disappeared  
You never considered how my heart shattered because of you  
Without a word of reason, you left without saying goodbye  
I won’t accept your fleeting love
