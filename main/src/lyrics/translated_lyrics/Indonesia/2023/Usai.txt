**Translated Lyrics:**

Maybe this is the time  
I understand the feeling of regret  
When someone leaves and disappears  

You came and carved a wound  
So dear that I wish to forget  
You left without teaching me  
How to let you go  

**Chorus:**  
It’s all over, every story  
That we’ve etched together  
Leaving you behind is  
The hardest thing I have to face  
I truly am losing  
You, whom I love so much  
Yet you have lost  
Me, who loves you deeply  

I will keep learning  
To forget  
You, who so easily  
Forgot about me  

**Back to Chorus**  

*(Note: The song expresses deep feelings of loss and regret after a relationship ends, highlighting the pain of unreciprocated love and the struggle to move on.)*
