**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The unhealable  
Let it be  
Drying on its own  
Adorning the body and  
Those who evaluate  
Your form  
Only you alone  
They cannot

[Pre-Chorus]  
Passing through what you've passed  
With each changing day  
The obstacles you face

[Chorus]  
Problems that cloud the mind  
Oh, fragile feelings  
This is not even half of it  
It's just fine  
You're okay

[Verse 2]  
Those who always want to take the stage  
Only competing to be sadder than you  
Sick of being sidelined  
Being equated  
Your heart is hurt, perfectly

[Chorus]  
Problems that cloud the mind  
Oh, fragile feelings  
This is not even half of it  
It's just fine  
You're okay  
A long journey  
You rise to take a chance  
The day isn't over yet  
It's just fine  
You're okay

[Bridge]  
Wash your face, brush your teeth, evaluate  
Sleep for a moment to meet tomorrow morning  
Though it hurts, I'm with you this time  
I still want to see you tomorrow  
Wash your face, brush your teeth, evaluate  
Sleep for a moment to meet tomorrow morning  
Though it hurts, I'm with you this time  
I still want to see you tomorrow

[Outro]  
Wash your face, brush your teeth, evaluate  
Sleep for a moment to meet tomorrow morning  
Though it hurts, I'm with you this time  
I still want to see you tomorrow
