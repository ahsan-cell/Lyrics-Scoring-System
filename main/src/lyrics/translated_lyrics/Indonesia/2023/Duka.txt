**Translated Lyrics:**

You kill me with this pain  
You throw me into the cracks of my heart  
Until tears can no longer  
Paint the hurt  
That you carved into this heart of mine  

[Verse 2]  
You shattered me when you left  
After you broke these wings  
Until I can no longer  
Fly high again  
And search for a star  
That could replace you  

[Chorus]  
Even now, I still try  
To wake from my dreams  
That make me unaware  
That you are no longer mine  
Though my heart will never  
Be able to forget you  
And every drop of tear  
That falls strengthens my longing  

In the beauty of your shadow, your laughter  
In the beauty of the sorrow within our memories  

[Instrumental]  

[Chorus]  
Even now, I still try  
To wake from my dreams  
That make me unaware  
That you are no longer mine  
Though my heart will never  
Be able to forget you  
And every drop of tear  
That falls strengthens my longing  
In the beauty of your shadow, your laughter  
In the beauty of the sorrow within our memories
