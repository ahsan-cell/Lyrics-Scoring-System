**Translated Lyrics:**

In this place  
In the very first place I found you  
I return to this spot again  
But I hear something else...

[Verse 2: Audy]  
Faintly I hear  
A voice I’ve always known, it’s your voice  
You look happy with him  
He’s your new love

[Verse 3: Virgoun]  
I stand still  
As a little girl runs towards you  
The little girl with beautiful eyes  
Just like yours

[Pre-Chorus: Virgoun & Audy]  
(And you smile)  
I smile too  
And I hold the hand of the woman beside me  
(And you hold his hand, and you hold his hand)  
And whisper softly in my heart  
About all of this

[Chorus 1: Virgoun]  
If only you hadn’t left my life back then  
I wouldn’t have found the love I have now  
A love that accepts flaws  
And changes how I see the world

[Chorus 2: Audy]  
If only I had forced us to stay together  
Our story might not have ended happily  
A story that matured both of us  
Even through the pain...

[Post-Chorus: Virgoun & Audy]  
One thing I now understand  
Though it’s hard for my lips to say  
There will always be the word 'Congratulations'  
In every 'Goodbye'

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1: Virgoun & Audy, Virgoun & Audy]  
If only you hadn’t left my life (from your life)  
I wouldn’t have found the love I have now (that I have)  
A love that accepts flaws  
And changes how I see the world

[Chorus 2: Audy & Virgoun, Virgoun & Audy]  
If only I had forced us to stay together (to stay with you)  
Our story might not have ended happily  
A story that matured both of us  
Even through the pain (even through the pain)  
(Even through the pain...)

[Post-Chorus: Virgoun & Audy]  
One thing I now understand  
Though it’s hard for my lips to say  
There will always be the word 'Congratulations'  
In every 'Goodbye'

[Outro: Audy & Virgoun]  
Goodbye (goodbye)  
Faintly I hear...  
In this place...  
A voice I’ve always known, it’s your voice  
In the very first place I found you...
