**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
From afar, a story of us unfolds  
Separated by distance and time  
I want to express my longing through beautiful words  
But it's not enough for you  

[Refrain]  
Because you are too beautiful for mere words  
The world pauses for a moment to enjoy your beauty  

[Chorus]  
And if I'm not with you  
I assure you, I’ll face a world less beautiful than yesterday  
Your simple laughter is enough!  
Completing the perfection of life with you  
If I go through the day without your presence  
My smile with someone else is in vain, oh  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
And if I'm not with you  
I assure you, I’ll face a world less beautiful than yesterday  
Your simple laughter is enough!  
Completing the perfection of life with you  
If I'm not with you  
I assure you, I’ll face a world less beautiful than yesterday  
Your simple laughter is enough!  
Completing the perfection of life with you
