**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The morning greets us beautifully  
I smile seeing you still tired  
I've tried in many ways  
So we won't miss this lovely day  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So many things we've been through  
In each passing day  

[Chorus]  
With you, I understand the meaning of love  
The true meaning of love  
Growing with every moment  
And understanding the essence of love  
The essence of eternal love  
I will cherish this love  

[Verse 2]  
I've tried in many ways  
So we won't miss this lovely day  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So many things we've been through  
In each passing day  

[Chorus]  
With you, I understand the meaning of love  
The true meaning of love  
Growing with every moment  
And understanding the essence of love  
The essence of eternal love  
I will cherish this love  

[Bridge]  
We were brought together by love  
We do not break our promises  
We complete each other  
Until we grow old  

[Chorus]  
With you, I understand the meaning of love  
The true meaning of love  
Growing with every moment  
And understanding the essence of love  
The essence of eternal love  
I will cherish this love  
With you, I understand the meaning of love  
The true meaning of love  
Growing with every moment  
And understanding the essence of love  
The essence of eternal love  
I will cherish this love
