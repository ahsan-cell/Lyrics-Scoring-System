**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
You are my one true love  
I see it in the light of your eyes  
The wealth of your inner self is hidden there  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In your smile  
I hear the language of your heart  
Flowing clear, it resonates  
Now you are the one  
Who reigns in my mind  
And I will accompany you  
Together  
In every step you take  

[Chorus]  
Believe me  
Only I truly understand  
The restlessness of your soul, my love  
And the meaning of your disappointment  
My love, trust me  
Only I comprehend the depth  
Of the importance of honesty  
The beauty of your spirit, my love  
Believe me  

[Interlude]  
Hoo, hoo-oo  
Ho-oo-oo-oo  
Hoo-oo  
Hoo-oo  
Mm-mm  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In your smile  
I hear the language of your heart  
Flowing clear, it resonates  
Now you are the one  
Who reigns in my mind  
And I will accompany you  
Together  
In every step you take  
In every step you take, hoo  

[Chorus]  
Believe me  
Only I truly understand  
The restlessness of your soul, my love  
And the meaning of your disappointment  
My love, trust me  
Only I comprehend the depth  
Of the importance of honesty  
The beauty of your spirit, my love
