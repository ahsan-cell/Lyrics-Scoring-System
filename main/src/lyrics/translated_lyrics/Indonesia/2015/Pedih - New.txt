**Translated Lyrics:**

You who are heartbroken  
Cry out and donâ€™t hesitate to express  
How painful it is, a wounded heart  
The poison that slowly kills you  

[Verse 2]  
You who are feeling sorrow now  
Bearing the weight of your pain  
Pour out that hurt in your tears  
That pierces the deepest corners of your heart  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Only yourself  
Can truly understand this...  

[Verse 3]  
You whose heart is broken  
Embraced by despair, swept by suffering  
As the moments pass and tears run dry  
Unable to hold back the endless pain  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Only yourself  
Can truly understand this  

[Chorus]  
Here I accompany you in your tears  
If tears could melt a heart  
I will pull out the thorns of pain in your heart  
So I can see you smile in your sleep tonight  
Consider all of this  
A step towards growing up  
And undeniably  
Also for you...  

[Instrumental]  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Only yourself  
Can truly understand this  

[Chorus]  
Here I accompany you in your tears  
If tears could melt a heart  
I will pull out the thorns of pain in your heart  
So I can see you smile in your sleep tonight  
Consider all of this  
A step towards growing up  
And undeniably  
Also for...  

[Outro]  
You who are heartbroken...
