**Translated Lyrics:**

About our feelings  
Is it true that we love each other?  
Or have we just once loved?  

Don't you also feel it?  
The cold is starting to creep into our conversations  
Your question, "What are you doing?"  
Feels like just a formality.  

Try asking your heart again  
Should we break up or keep going?  
Are we holding on to this relationship  
Or just delaying the inevitable goodbye?  

Don't you also feel it?  
The cold is starting to creep into our conversations  
Your question, "What are you doing?"  
Feels like just a formality.  

Try asking your heart again  
Should we break up or keep going?  
Are we holding on to this relationship  
Or just delaying the inevitable goodbye, wo-oo.  

If you ask me what I want,  
I want us to stay together.  
We are holding on to this relationship  
Or just delaying the goodbye, oh-wo-wo.  
Just delaying the goodbye.
