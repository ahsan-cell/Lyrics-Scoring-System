**Translated Lyrics:**

You came when  
The light of my evening had dimmed  
And said goodbye when  
My full moon was at its peak  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You who stopped by but never stayed  
You who stopped by but never stayed  

[Chorus]  
I thought you were home  
Turns out you were just a rental  
From the body of a woman  
Who asked you to come back  

[Refrain]  
You are not home  
You are not home  
You are not home  
You are not home  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
I thought you were home  
Turns out you were just a rental  
From the body of a woman  
Who asked you to come back  

[Refrain]  
You are not home  
You are not home  
You are not home  
You are not home  

You are not home  
You are not home  
You are not home  
You are not home
