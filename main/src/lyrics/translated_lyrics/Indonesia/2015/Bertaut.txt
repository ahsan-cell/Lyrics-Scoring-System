**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Bun, life goes on like a rogue  
Like a hedgehog without a friend  
It barks like the sound of rain  
And you, my prince, take the lead  
Bun, when I’m broken, you love me  
Especially when I become a champion  
When I don’t know the way, you’re there  
Standing strong when I can’t

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let me explain a bit about me and you  
So the whole world knows

[Chorus]  
My stubbornness is just like yours  
The way I get angry, the way I smile  
Like the heartbeat that intertwines  
My soul ignites because of you  
I’m still here, watching you fight  
With all your might  
Like the heartbeat that intertwines  
My soul ignites because of you

[Verse 2]  
Bun, I still don’t understand many things  
Everything swims in my head  
And you and all that you know about it  
Become the answers when I ask

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let me explain a bit about me and you  
So the whole world knows

[Chorus]  
My stubbornness is just like yours  
The way I get angry, the way I smile  
Like the heartbeat that intertwines  
My soul ignites because of you  
I’m still here, watching you fight  
With all your might  
Like the heartbeat that intertwines  
My soul ignites because of you

[Outro]  
May you live long here  
Watching me struggle until the end  
Like the heartbeat that intertwines  
My soul ignites because of you
