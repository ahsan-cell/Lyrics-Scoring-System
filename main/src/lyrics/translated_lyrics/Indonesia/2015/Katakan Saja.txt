**Translated Lyrics:**

You came to me with your charm  
You came to me, stealing my heart  
Often you leave me feeling stiff  
Oh God, please give me strength  
This heart can't bear the feelings  
Allow me to be a part of your life  

Just say it if you want me  
I also want to know your feelings  
Just say it if it really can't be  
I also want to know your answer  

When I'm alone, your face appears in my mind  
Oh God, please give me strength  
This heart can't bear the feelings  
Allow me to be a part of your life, oh  

Just say it if you want me  
I also want to know your feelings  
Just say it if it really can't be  
I also want to know your answer, oh oh  

If only you knew, I hope for your reply  
So I won't doubt about you  
Please tell me if your feelings aren't for me  
So that I can...  
Oh  

Just say it if it really can't be  
I also want to know your answer  
Oh oh  
Just say it if it really can't be  
I also want to know your answer.
