**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I found you when I was trapped  
In a situation that made me restless  
You embraced me when others oppressed me  
I long to always be with you  

[Verse 2]  
But why did it suddenly seem like you left?  
Releasing your embrace and stopping your protection without reason  

[Chorus]  
Maybe the universe doesn’t accept it  
And time didn’t give us a chance  
But at least you’ve changed me  
From restlessness to wounds  

[Verse 1]  
I found you when I fell  
Into a space filled with bitterness  
You protected me when others attacked me  
I long to see you in every step I take  

[Verse 2]  
But why did it suddenly seem like you left?  
Releasing your embrace and stopping your protection without reason  

[Chorus]  
Maybe the universe doesn’t accept it  
And time didn’t give us a chance  
But at least you’ve changed me  
From restlessness to wounds  

[Outro]  
Yet I will remain here  
Waiting for the universe to accept  
And the wind to bring the answers  
Because my heartbeat and my pulse will always  
Long for you
