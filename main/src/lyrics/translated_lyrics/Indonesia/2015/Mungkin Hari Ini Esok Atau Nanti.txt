**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I approach the path we used to walk  
Every day we were here  

[Verse 2]  
I wait for your return  
Only memories remain here  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But now you have gone  
And I believe you won’t come back  

[Chorus]  
Maybe today  
Tomorrow or later  
A million memories etched in this heart of mine  
Maybe today  
Tomorrow or later  
We no longer greet each other  
Though I still hope for you  

[Verse 2]  
I wait for your presence to return  
Only memories remain here  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But now you have gone  
And I believe you won’t come back  

[Chorus]  
Maybe today  
Tomorrow or later  
A million memories etched in this heart of mine  
Maybe today  
Tomorrow or later  
We no longer greet each other  
Though I still hope for you  

[Bridge]  
Truly my heart  
Cannot accept it  
And forget everything  

[Chorus]  
Maybe today  
Tomorrow or later  
A million memories etched in this heart of mine  
Maybe today  
Tomorrow or later  
We no longer greet each other  
Though I still hope for you, ooh-ooh  
Though I still hope for you, ooh-ooh  

[Outro]  
I let you go
