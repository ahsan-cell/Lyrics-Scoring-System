**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Since the first time I met you,  
My heart can't turn away from you.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
There isn't a single doubt,  
Let's live the rest of our lives together.  

[Chorus]  
This heart is intoxicated by your love,  
Your name stretches across my heart.  
The sparkle of stars in my heart,  
Your smile, oh darling, decorates my love's frame.  
You have become the star in my heart,  
The sparkle of stars in my heart.  

[Verse 2]  
Even though the sun lights up the world,  
The shine in your eyes outshines all light.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
There isn't a single doubt,  
Let's live the rest of our lives together.  

[Chorus]  
This heart is intoxicated by your love,  
Your name stretches across my heart.  
The sparkle of stars in my heart,  
Your smile, oh darling, decorates my love's frame.  
You have become the star in my heart,  
The sparkle of stars in my heart.  

[Bridge]  
No words can capture this feeling,  
The story between us two.  
Oh, guiding light of my conscience,  
Your glow is everlasting.  

[Chorus]  
This heart is intoxicated by your love,  
Your name stretches across my heart.  
The sparkle of stars in my heart,  
Your smile, oh darling, decorates my love's frame.  
You have become the star in my heart,  
The sparkle of stars in my heart.
