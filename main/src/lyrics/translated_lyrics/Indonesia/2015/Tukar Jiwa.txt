**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I'm out of ways to explain to you  
Why it's hard to forget you  
I'm out of ways to describe to you  
How you are in my eyes and in my view  

[Chorus]  
(Just for one day)  
Just for one day, try being me  
(You'll understand)  
You'll understand how I see you  

[Post-Chorus]  
Admiring you  
Loving you  
From my perspective  
From my perspective  

[Verse 2]  
I'm out of ways to describe to you  
How you are in my eyes and in my view  
If only for one day we could swap souls  
You would understand and stop wondering  

[Chorus]  
(Just for one day)  
Just for one day, try being me  
(You'll understand)  
You'll understand how I see you  
(Just for one day)  
Just for one day, try being me  
(You'll understand)  
You'll understand how I see you  

[Post-Chorus]  
Admiring you  
Loving you  
Admiring you  
Loving you  
From my perspective  
From my perspective  
From my perspective  
From my perspective
