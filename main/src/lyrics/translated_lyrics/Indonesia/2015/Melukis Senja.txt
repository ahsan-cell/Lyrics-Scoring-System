**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I understand  
The journey of life that you’re going through now  
I hope  
Even though it’s tough, you don’t feel alone  
You have fought  
Conquering your difficult days  
Let me accompany you  
Washing away your fatigue  

[Chorus]  
Allow me to paint the sunset  
Carving your name there  
Listening to you share your stories  
Crying and laughing  
Let me paint the night  
Bringing you the stars  
To accompany you, who is hurting  
Until you find happiness  

[Verse 2]  
I’m here  
Though tired, let’s try again  
Don’t stop  
I hope even though it’s tough, you don’t feel alone  
You have fought  
Conquering your difficult days  
Let me accompany you  
Washing away your fatigue  

[Chorus]  
Allow me to paint the sunset  
Carving your name there  
Listening to you share your stories  
Crying and laughing  
Let me paint the night  
Bringing you the stars  
To accompany you, who is hurting  
Until you find happiness
