**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Arsy Widianto]  
I tremble right in front of you  
My heart races as I hold your hand  
I’m lucky now to have your love  
The most beautiful in my heart, since the moment we met  

[Pre-Chorus: Tiara Andini]  
Promise me, don’t hurt my heart  
Like the stories of the past  

[Chorus: Arsy Widianto]  
You’re not my first love  
But I hope  
From this day on, at this moment  
You are my love  

[Verse 2: Tiara Andini]  
What I feel with you is all different  
A kind-hearted lover  
Now by my side  

[Pre-Chorus: Tiara Andini with Arsy Widianto]  
Promise me there won’t be  
Another heart, besides mine  
Ooh-Ooh  

[Chorus: Tiara Andini]  
You’re not my first love  
But I hope  
From this day on, at this moment  
You are my love  

[Bridge: Tiara Andini & Arsy Widianto]  
Never doubt my loyalty, ooh  
I don’t want this love to be shared  
Love, ooh  
You are my love  

[Chorus: Tiara Andini & Arsy Widianto, Both]  
You’re not my first love  
But I hope  
From this day on, at this moment  
You are my love  
You’re not my first love  
But I hope  
From this day on, at this moment  
You are my love  
From this day on, at this moment  
You are my love, ooh  

[Outro: Tiara Andini & Arsy Widianto]  
One for eternity, ooh
