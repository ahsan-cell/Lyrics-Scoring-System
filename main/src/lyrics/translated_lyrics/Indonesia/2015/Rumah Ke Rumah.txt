**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Regretful, I didn’t express  
My puppy love for Kanya and Rebecca  
How are you all doing over there?  
I hope life is treating you well  
Not learning, caught in the aftermath  
When I was with Thanya and Saphira  
I believed maybe it wasn’t the way  
But you were also wrong in many ways  
If only I hadn’t changed so fast back then  
This is my apology to you, Sharfina  
All the good prayers are for you  
And your noble dreams

[Chorus]  
Moving periodically, house to house  
Hoping it can end beautifully  
Even if we must part in the end  
Thank you for making it not easy  
Moving periodically, house to house  
Hoping it can end beautifully  
Even if we must part in the end  
Thank you for making it not easy  

[Verse 2]  
Sorry if I often cause trouble  
Indisya, Panda, Anggra, Caca, Sismita  
The strongest women in my life  
Face whatever you aim for  
You came when my darkness broke  
All my heart is for you, Meidiana  
You deserve the best in this world  
May we endure for a long time

[Chorus]  
Moving periodically, house to house  
Learning lessons when we part  
If someday it ends beautifully  
Let’s write our names in history  
Moving periodically, house to house  
Learning lessons when we part  
If someday it ends beautifully  
Let’s write our names in history  

[Bridge]  
Tired of wandering, house to house  
Sometimes I forget about you, Amalia  
Always ready whenever I tell stories  
I’m lucky to be your child, Mother  

[Chorus]  
Moving periodically, house to house  
Always surrendering to You  
If I am mentioned in history  
They won’t forget who I am  
Moving periodically, house to house  
Always surrendering to You  
If I am mentioned in history  
They won’t forget who I am
