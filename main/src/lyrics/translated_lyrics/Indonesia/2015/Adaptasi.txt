**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Staying in this house with you  
From night until night again  
Trapped in hesitant steps, going nowhere  
From Wednesday to Wednesday again  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The more time we have to talk  
The more I understand what you hope for  
The more time we spend together  
I’m grateful that you’re whole, body and soul  

[Chorus]  
If this (Is not yet over)  
We will still (Keep each other safe)  
The future (No one knows)  
Your presence is so precious, I want you to know  
I love you  

[Verse 2]  
We are under the same protective roof  
Waiting for the calm of the morning sky  
Realizing the beauty of your new wrinkles  
Peacefully devoted to watching over you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The more time I spend with you  
The better I become at arranging my longing  
The more time I’m close to you  
The more I understand your prayers  

[Chorus]  
If this (Is not yet over)  
We will still (Keep each other safe)  
The future (No one knows)  
Your presence is so precious, I want you to know  
I love you  
I love you
