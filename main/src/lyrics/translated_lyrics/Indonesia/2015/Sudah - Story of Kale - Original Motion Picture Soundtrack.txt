**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Enough  
Let’s end all the talking  
I want to be alone with you  
And as morning approaches  
Bringing forth the morning sun, enough  
Let’s put an end to all suspicions  
Let the world just keep turning  
Capture moments that won’t come again, and enough  
Let’s end the sorrowful night  
The world will be just fine  
Rain will come, giving birth to a rainbow  

[Chorus]  
Learn to understand the future  
Will what’s kept inside bring peace?  
Giving life to all beautiful melodies  
Trying to find your own happiness  

[Verse 2]  
Forget all the suffering  
The universe’s prayers will protect  
Wounds will fade away  
Slowly healing, oh
