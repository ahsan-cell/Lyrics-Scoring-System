**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It’s impossible for you to forget so quickly  
The tears of sadness you shed back then  
Revealing all your shortcomings  
Everything in me that you don’t have  

[Verse 2]  
The charm that you truly possess  
I genuinely want to protect  
And after your wounds have healed  
You forget that I also have feelings  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Then you went back to him  
Did you feel ashamed of my touch?  

[Chorus]  
Under the wet gray sky  
Where are you?  
In the embrace of the night heading into the weekend  
Where are you?  

[Verse 3]  
Sometimes the ring still bears your name  
A few text messages for me  
I don’t know what you mean, but I know  
Loving you, I’ve made a mistake  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Come on, write in your diary  
Later explain when you have the time  

[Chorus]  
Under the wet gray sky  
Where are you?  
In the embrace of the night heading into the weekend  
Where are you?  

[Bridge]  
Have you met with satisfaction?  
Is your heart truly happy?  
Have you met with satisfaction?  
Is your heart truly happy?  

[Chorus]  
Under the wet gray sky  
Where are you?  
In the embrace of the night heading into the weekend  
Where are you?  
Under the wet gray sky  
Where are you?  
In the embrace of the night heading into the weekend  
Where are you?  
Where are you?
