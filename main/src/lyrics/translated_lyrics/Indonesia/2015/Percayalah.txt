**Translated Lyrics:**

I am the one who won't let go  
You are the one who holds my heart  
We can never be separated  
Let whatever happens, happen  

[Verse 2]  
I am the one who can't let go  
You are the one who owns my heart  
Even if it may be too soon  
For both of us to say...  

[Chorus]  
Forever we will be together  
Overcoming everything that could separate us  
Forever we will be together  
There will be no doubt now and in the future  
Believe me  

[Verse 3]  
I am the one who can't let go  
You are the one who holds my heart  
Even if it may be too soon  
For both of us to say...  

[Chorus]  
Forever we will be together  
Overcoming everything that could separate us  
Forever we will be together  
There will be no doubt now and in the future  
Believe me  

[Bridge]  
Believe me  
Only you are created for me  

[Outro]  
Forever we will be together  
There will be no doubt now and in the future  
Believe me  
There will be no doubt now and in the future  
There will be no doubt  
The heart has chosen  
Believe me (Believe me)
