**Translated Lyrics:**

You, quietly I’ve fallen in love with you  
I’m tired of hiding my feelings for you  
But I can’t bring myself to say it in front of you  

[Chorus]  
I’m not one to easily love  
Not one to easily say "I love you"  
But why is it now with you  
I’ve fallen in love  

God, please hear me  
Give me this person  
But if it’s not meant to be  
What can I do?  

[Verse 2]  
I’m tired of hiding my feelings for you  
But I can’t bring myself to say it in front of you  

[Chorus]  
I’m not one to easily love  
Not one to easily say "I love you"  
But why is it now with you  
I’ve fallen in love  

God, please hear me  
Give me this person  
But if it’s not meant to be  
What can I do?  

[Bridge]  
I can’t force you  
To be my lover, if you’re not my destiny  

[Chorus]  
I’m not one to easily love  
Not one to easily say "I love you"  
But why is it now with you  
I’ve fallen in love  

God, please hear me  
Give me this person  
But if it’s not meant to be  
What can I do?
