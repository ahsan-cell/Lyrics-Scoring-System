**Translated Lyrics:**

Even if sometimes you get angry  
And you hold a grudge against me  
My heart won't turn to  
Anyone else because you're the only one in it  

So please  
Baby, baby, come tonight  
Promise baby that I’m gonna be polite  
I won’t let you sleep with anger towards me  
While it's still early, let’s fix this  

[Verse 1: Crakky]  
Nothing's easy, but if we talk about it  
It’ll be easier to replace anger with love  
I don’t want us to reach this point  
I don’t want to sleep without you by my side  

Because no matter what happens, you’re still the only one  
Who owns my chaotic world  
You’re the one I want to shine like a rainbow, ugh  
Let’s fight as many times as we need  
Just don’t let us separate if that happens  
Surely, the whole day will feel dull  

It’s not that I’m seeking attention  
I know you’re just looking for affection  
Sorry if sometimes I come off wrong  
When we argue, let’s not blow it up  

Can we just not let you leave?  
Let go of your anger  
I just want to kiss you  
Instead of getting mad, let’s just kiss  

[Chorus: Jom]  
Even if sometimes you get angry  
And you hold a grudge against me  
My heart won't turn to  
Anyone else because you're the only one in it  

So please  
Baby, baby, come tonight  
Promise baby that I’m gonna be polite  
I won’t let you sleep with anger towards me  
While it's still early, let’s fix this  

[Verse 2: Russell]  
Yuh!  

Sometimes it’s not easy  
To soothe you when you’re angry and can’t hold back  
Especially when it’s hard for us to meet  
You just want to sleep, and then you’ll sulk, yuh!  
I’ll call you right away on your phone  
I won’t plan to find a clone of you  
I just want to talk to you before sleeping  
What we fought about feels so out of place  
I won’t prolong this (prolong this)  
You’re the only one I’ll love (I’ll love)  

Even if our relationship is tough  
We both need to work on it (work on it)  
If we often make mistakes (make mistakes)  
Saying hurtful things (hurtful things)  
Always remember nothing lasts  
If we keep rushing, yuh! (rushing)  

[Chorus: Jom]  
Even if sometimes you get angry  
And you hold a grudge against me  
My heart won't turn to  
Anyone else because you're the only one in it  

So please  
Baby, baby, come tonight  
Promise baby that I’m gonna be polite  
I won’t let you sleep with anger towards me  
While it's still early, let’s fix this  

[Verse 3: Clien]  
It’s hard to avoid fighting  
You can curse better than mom  
Please, don’t drag this out  
The chance to be with you is slipping away  
I only get to kiss you once in a while (only once, to kiss you)  
Can we take our time so there are no excuses?  
No oh  
Come on, baby (come on)  
Please forgive me (please forgive me)  
I miss you lately  
What’s your situation now?  

[Chorus: Jom]  
Even if sometimes you get angry  
And you hold a grudge against me  
My heart won't turn to  
Anyone else because you're the only one in it  

So please  
Baby, baby, come tonight  
Promise baby that I’m gonna be polite  
I won’t let you sleep with anger towards me  
While it's still early, let’s fix this  

[Verse 4: Jom]  
I will never tire  
Of always understanding you  
Even if we’re not always together  
Your hugs are still what I want in the morning  

It’s still you  
Even if sometimes you ignore me  
I don’t know what you want to express  
But please, don’t ever tire of me loving you  

Don’t you see  
That I’m still holding on  
Still trying to win you over  
What do I need to do because  

[Chorus: Jom]  
Even if sometimes you get angry  
And you hold a grudge against me  
My heart won't turn to  
Anyone else because you're the only one in it  

So please  
Baby, baby, come tonight  
Promise baby that I’m gonna be polite  
I won’t let you sleep with anger towards me  
While it's still early, let’s fix this
