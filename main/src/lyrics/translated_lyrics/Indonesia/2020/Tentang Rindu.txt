**Translated Lyrics:**

Morning has gone  
The sun no longer shines  
I don't know until when  
I'll keep remembering you  

[Chorus]  
I just stay silent  
Holding back  
All this longing  
Calling your name  

Every night  
I wish you would come  
And be present in my dreams  
Longing  

[Verse 2]  
And time will answer  
My meeting with you  
Until now  
Iâ€™m still here  

[Chorus]  
I just stay silent  
Holding back  
All this longing  
Calling your name  

Every night  
I wish you would come  
And be present in my dreams  
Longing  

[Bridge]  
And your shadow  
Will always lean in my heart  
I promise I will return with you  

[Chorus]  
I just stay silent  
Holding back  
All this longing  
Calling your name  

Every night  
I wish you would come  
And be present in my dreams  

I just stay silent  
Holding back  
All this longing  
Calling your name  

Every night  
I wish you would come  
And be present in my dreams  
Always in my dreams  
Longing
