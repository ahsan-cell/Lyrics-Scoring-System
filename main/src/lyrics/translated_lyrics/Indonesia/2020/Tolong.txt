**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I feel like I'm falling in love  
Because this feeling is different  
Oh, is this really love?  
It’s always different when I look at you, ooh  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Why am I like this?  
Losing the courage to be close to you  
I want to have you  
But I don’t know  
(How to do it)  

[Chorus]  
Please, tell him  
This song I wrote for him  
I always mention his name in my prayers  
Until I’m able  
To say "will you be with me?"  

[Verse 2]  
I feel like I'm falling in love  
Because this feeling is different  
Oh, is this really love?  
It’s always different when I look at you, ooh  

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Here I stand  
Waiting for the right moment until  
Finally, I can  
Tell you, oh  

[Chorus]  
Please, tell him  
This song I wrote for him  
I always mention his name in my prayers  
Until I’m able  
To say "will you be with me?"  

[Bridge]  
Please, tell him  
This song I wrote for him  
I always mention his name in my prayers  
Could he know, the love that I want?  
Ooh  

[Chorus]  
Please, tell him  
This song I wrote for him  
I always mention his name in my prayers  
Until I’m able  
To say "will you be with me?"  

[Outro]  
Hooh, will you be with me?
