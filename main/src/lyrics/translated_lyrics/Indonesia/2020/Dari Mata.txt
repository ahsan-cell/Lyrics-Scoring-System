**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Your eyes weaken me  
The first time I saw you  
And honestly, I've never felt  
I've never felt this way  
Your eyes weaken me  
The first time I saw you  
And honestly, I've never felt  
I've never felt this way  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, could this be love at first sight?  
Because what I feel is unusual  
If this is truly love  
Where do I start?  
Oh, where do I start?  

[Chorus]  
From your eyes, your eyes  
I begin to fall in love  
I see, I see a shadow of it  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper, falling into my heart  
From your eyes, your eyes  
I begin to fall in love  
I see, I see a shadow of it  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper, falling into my heart  

[Verse 2]  
Your eyes weaken me  
The first time I saw you  
And honestly, I've never felt  
I've never felt this way  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, could this be love at first sight?  
Because what I feel is unusual  
If this is truly love  
Where do I start?  
Oh, where do I start?  

[Chorus]  
From your eyes, your eyes  
I begin to fall in love  
I see, I see a shadow of it  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper, falling into my heart  
From your eyes, your eyes  
I begin to fall in love  
I see, I see a shadow of it  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper, falling into my heart  

[Bridge]  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper  
Falling into my heart  

[Chorus]  
From your eyes, your eyes  
I begin to fall in love  
I see, I see a shadow of it, oh  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper, falling into my heart (Falling into my heart)  
From your eyes, your eyes  
I begin to fall in love  
I see, I see a shadow of it  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling deeper  
From your eyes, you make me fall  
Falling into my heart
