**Translated Lyrics:**

Winning my heart  
Is not an easy thing to do  
You’ve succeeded in making  
Me unable to live without you  

**[Verse 2]**  
Keeping that love  
Is not an easy task  
Yet not for a second have you  
Turned away from me  

**[Refrain]**  
How lucky I am  
To be yours  

**[Chorus]**  
You are the proof  
Of beauty in both face and heart  
You become the harmony when I sing  
About the light and darkness of this life  

You are the most beautiful form  
Of God’s goodness towards me  
Time does not erase your beauty  
You are the greatest woman to me  
Please remember that  

**[Verse 3]**  
Breaking down my ego  
Is not an easy feat  
With your gentle love, you shatter  
The hardness of my heart  

**[Refrain]**  
How lucky I am  
To be yours (I want you to know)  

**[Chorus]**  
You are the proof  
Of beauty in both face and heart  
You become the harmony when I sing  
About the light and darkness of this life  

You are the most beautiful form (you are the most beautiful form)  
Of God’s goodness towards me  
Time does not erase your beauty (does not erase your beauty)  
You are the greatest woman to me  
Please remember that  

**[Interlude]**  
All that serves as proof is stored deep within my heart  
All that serves as proof is stored deep within my heart  

**[Chorus]**  
You are the proof  
Of beauty in both face and heart  
You become the harmony when I sing  
About the light and darkness of this life  

You are the most beautiful form (you are the most beautiful form)  
Of God’s goodness towards me  
Time does not erase your beauty (does not erase your beauty)  
You are the greatest woman to me  
Please remember that  

**[Outro]**  
Please remember that
