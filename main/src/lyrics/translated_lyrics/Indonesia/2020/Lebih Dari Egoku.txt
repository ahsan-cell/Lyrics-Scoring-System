**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's hard for me to face you  
But I won't give up  
You are worth fighting for  
It hurts me to hold back my anger  
But I will do it  
Even more than that  

[Chorus]  
I'm the one who apologizes even though you're in the wrong  
I will hold on even if you want to part ways  
Because you are important, more important  
Than everything I have  
If you're wrong, I will forget  
Even though you might not do the same  
Because to me, you are more important  
Than my ego  

[Verse 2]  
It hurts me to hold back my anger  
But I will do it  
Even more than that  

[Chorus]  
I'm the one who apologizes even though you're in the wrong  
I will hold on even if you want to part ways  
Because you are important, more important  
Than everything I have  
If you're wrong, I will forget  
Even though you might not do the same  
Because to me, you are more important  
Than my ego  
I'm the one who apologizes even though you're in the wrong  
I will hold on even if you want to part ways  
Because you are important, more important  
Than everything I have  
If you're wrong, I will forget  
Even though you might not do the same  
Because to me, you are more important  
Than my ego
