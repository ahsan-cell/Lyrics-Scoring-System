**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When you fall  
And hurt your heart  
Wherever it is  
I'll find you  

[Verse 2]  
When you are weak  
And powerless  
Look at me  
For you  

[Chorus]  
Whenever dreams feel far away  
Oh remember this  
I will always  
Be your protective wings  
When your world starts to fade  
And you feel lost  
I will always  
Be your protective wings  

[Verse 3]  
When you are scared  
And lost  
Wherever it is  
I'll find you  

[Verse 4]  
Your tears  
Will not fall  
Look at me  
For you  

[Chorus]  
Whenever dreams feel far away  
Oh remember this  
I will always  
Be your protective wings  
When your world starts to fade  
And you feel lost  
I will always  
Be your protective wings  

[Bridge]  
Even if you can't cope  
I won't give up  
I'm here for you  

[Chorus]  
Whenever dreams feel far away  
Oh remember this  
I will always  
Be your protective wings  
When your world starts to fade  
And you feel lost  
I will always  
Be your protective wings
