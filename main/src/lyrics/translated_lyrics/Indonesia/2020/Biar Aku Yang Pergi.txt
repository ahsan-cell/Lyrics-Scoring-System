**Translated Lyrics:**

I never expected  
Everything to be like this  
All that was beautiful  
Has turned to nothingness  

[Verse 2]  
I can't fathom  
How you could do this  
Leaving me behind  
Without any certainty  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I can only hope  
That you're happy over there  
With him, your choice  
Even though he’s my friend  

[Chorus]  
Let me be the one to go  
Let me be the one who’s hurt  
Let me be the one to stop  
Stop hoping for you  
Oh God, give me strength  
To accept all of this  
If he is truly meant for me  
I hope you bring him back to me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I can only hope  
That you're happy over there  
With him, your choice  
Even though he’s my friend  

[Chorus]  
Let me be the one to go  
Let me be the one who’s hurt  
Let me be the one to stop  
Stop hoping for you  
Oh God, give me strength  
To accept all of this  
If he is truly meant for me  
I hope you bring him back to me  

[Chorus]  
Let me be the one to go  
Let me be the one who’s hurt  
Let me be the one to stop  
Stop hoping for you  
Oh God, give me strength  
Hoo hoo ooh  
If he is truly meant for me  
I hope you bring him back to me  

[Chorus]  
Let me be the one to go  
Let me be the one who’s hurt  
Let me be the one to stop  
I who will stop (hoping for you)  
Oh God, give me strength  
Give me strength  
To accept all of this  
If he is truly meant for me  
I hope you bring him back to me  

[Outro]  
Oh God, bring him back to me
