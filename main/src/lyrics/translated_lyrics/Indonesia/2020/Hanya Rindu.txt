**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When I'm alone, I look at photos and videos  
Of you that I've kept for so long  
This heart shatters seeing all these images  
That I can't, I can't relive again  

[Chorus]  
I wish right now, you were here with me  
Laughing together like we used to  
Even if just for a moment, God, please grant it  
It's not that I can't accept the reality  
This heart just longs for you  

[Verse 2]  
I've tried every way  
To be able to live without you  
But everything feels different  
It's hard for me to erase the memories of you  

[Chorus]  
I wish right now, you were here with me  
Laughing together like we used to  
Even if just for a moment, God, please grant it  
It's not that I can't accept the reality  
This heart just longs for you  
Just longs for you  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
I wish right now, you were here with me  
Laughing together like we used to  
Even if just for a moment, God, please grant it  
It's not that I can't accept the reality  
It's not that I can't accept the reality  
This heart just longs for you  
This heart just longs for you  
I miss your smile, Mom...
