**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Your beautiful smile  
Is like a drug  
I want to keep seeing it, even from afar  

[Verse 1]  
I wish you were here  
To heal my longing heart  
In the silence, I mourn alone  
For feelings that go unheard  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s okay if this feeling  
Grows on its own  
I feel powerless when you're near  
Even if it's just your shadow  

[Chorus]  
Your beautiful smile  
Is like a drug  
I want to keep seeing it, even from afar  
Now I realize  
It’s all just my dream  
That fantasizes  
About being with you  

[Chorus]  
Your beautiful smile  
Is like a drug  
I want to keep seeing it, even from afar  
Now I realize  
It’s all just my dream  
That fantasizes  
About being with you  

[Coda]  
Surrounded by a thousand doubts  
Only silence remains, ooooooh  
Surrounded by a thousand doubts  
Only silence remains, ooooooh  
I hope...
