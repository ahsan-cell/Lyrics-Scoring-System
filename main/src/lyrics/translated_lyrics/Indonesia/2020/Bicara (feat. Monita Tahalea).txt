**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Mikha Angelo]  
How long has it been  
Since I’ve waited for your answer?  
Have my words reached you,  
The ones I've woven together,  
So you know my feelings  
That have long been buried?  
This is what I feel.

[Chorus: Monita Tahalea, Both]  
Don’t just talk,  
I don’t need words  
To understand what you feel,  
Because all I need  
Is half of your heart  
In my life  
To make me happy.

[Verse 2: Monita Tahalea, Both]  
Say what you desire,  
Whatever it is, I’ll give it to you.  
If only you were with me  
In the same place and time,  
You would know my feelings  
That have long been buried.  
This is what I feel.

[Chorus: Mikha Angelo]  
Don’t just talk,  
I don’t need words  
To understand what you feel,  
Because all I need  
Is half of your heart  
In my life  
To make me happy.

[Bridge: Mikha Angelo, Monita Tahalea, Both]  
Since you’ve been here, I understand  
How much I need you.  
If my words aren’t enough  
To make you understand,  
Let me meet you again.

[Chorus: Both]  
Don’t just talk,  
I don’t need words  
To understand what you feel,  
Because all I need  
Is half of your heart  
In my life  
To make me happy.

[Outro: Both]  
To make me happy.
