**Translated Lyrics:**

I leave you  
Far from you  
My love  

Because I am yours  
You are mine  
Half of my soul  

Living with you  
Together we will go through  
Even if the storms rage, we won’t stop  
In life and death  
The sun knows I love you  

Believe me, I won’t go anywhere  
I will always be here to accompany you until old age  
Believe me, I won’t go anywhere  
I will keep my loyalty  
We are happy together  

I will never forget  
You whom I love  
From head to toe  

I want you  
You are what I desire  
My soulmate  
You are my future  

Together we will go through  
Even if the storms rage, we won’t stop  
In life and death  
The sun knows I love you  

Believe me, I won’t go anywhere  
I will always be here to accompany you until old age  
Believe me, I won’t go anywhere  
I will keep my loyalty  
We are happy together  

I will keep my loyalty  
We are happy together  

Believe me, I won’t go anywhere  
I will always be here to accompany you until old age  
We are happy together  

I am yours  
You are mine  
I will always be here until old age  

Believe me, I won’t go anywhere  
I will keep my loyalty  
We are happy together
