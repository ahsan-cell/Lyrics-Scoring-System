**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
This is not just a hope,  
And this hope is not merely a dream.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let me take care of her until her hair turns gray and white,  
Becoming a witness to my love for her.  
My heart is serious,  
No matter the obstacles, I want to be with her.  

[Chorus]  
I want her, I don’t want anyone else,  
Only she is always there in my times of joy and sorrow.  
I want her, even with all our differences,  
I want her to be happy only with me.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let me take care of her until her hair turns gray and white,  
Becoming a witness to my love for her.  
My heart is serious,  
No matter the obstacles, I want to be with her.  

[Chorus]  
I want her, I don’t want anyone else,  
Only she is always there in my times of joy and sorrow.  
I want her, even with all our differences,  
I want her to be happy only with me.  

[Bridge]  
I’m not forcing, oh God,  
But I love her,  
I want her.  

[Chorus]  
I want her, I don’t want anyone else,  
Only she is always there in my times of joy and sorrow.  
I want her, even with all our differences,  
I want her to be happy only with me.
