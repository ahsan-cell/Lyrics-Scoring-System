**Translated Lyrics:**

I don’t understand what has happened  
You’re not the same anymore, you’re not you  
The one who always sought me out and called me  
Your ring doesn’t sound anymore  

**[Chorus: Arsy Widianto]**  
Even if you erase me, push me away, replace my love  
Nothing can erase the love you’ve given me  
Even if you change, I will endure through all my time  
Let me love you in my own way  

**[Verse 2: Brisia Jodie]**  
I don’t understand why you’ve gone silent  
You’re not the same anymore, you’re not you  
Until I hesitate to call you  
Do you understand? I miss you  

**[Chorus: Brisia Jodie]**  
Even if you erase me, push me away, replace my love  
Nothing can erase the love you’ve given me  
Even if you change, I will endure through all my time  
Let me love you in my own way  

**[Bridge: Arsy Widianto & Brisia Jodie]**  
I don’t like it when  
You’re always close to her  
Don’t be jealous  
She’s just a friend in my class  

**[Chorus: Arsy Widianto & Brisia Jodie]**  
Even if you erase me, push me away, replace my love (replace my love)  
Nothing can erase the love you’ve given me (all the love you’ve given)  
Even if you change, I will endure through all my time  
Let me love you in my own way  

**[Chorus: Arsy Widianto & Brisia Jodie]**  
Even if you erase me, push me away, replace my love (won’t replace)  
Nothing can erase the love you’ve given me (I’ll never know)  
Even if you change, I will endure through all my time  
Let me love you in my own way  

**[Outro: Arsy Widianto & Brisia Jodie]**  
No need to be jealous  
I don’t want us to part because of this  
Let me always love you forever
