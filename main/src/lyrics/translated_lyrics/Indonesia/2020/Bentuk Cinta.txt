**Translated Lyrics:**

I don’t know what’s different  
About you today  
Is it because of your flat shoes?  
Or your nails that you’ve just painted?

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Have you ever wondered what water looks like without a container?  
Have you ever imagined what love looks like?

**[Chorus]**  
Your hair, colorful like cotton candy  
So cute and lovely, even if you’re not too tall  
Chubby cheeks and fair skin  
A sweet smile, rabbit teeth  
Makes me realize, what love looks like...  
It’s you...

**[Verse 2]**  
Now I know what’s different  
About you today  
It’s not because of your flat shoes  
Or your nails that you’ve just painted

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Have you ever wondered what water looks like without a container?  
Have you ever imagined what love looks like?

**[Chorus]**  
Your hair, colorful like cotton candy  
So cute and lovely, even if you’re not too tall  
Chubby cheeks and fair skin  
A sweet smile, rabbit teeth  
Makes me realize, what love looks like...  
It’s you...

**[Interlude]**

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Have you ever wondered what water looks like without a container?  
Have you ever imagined what love looks like?

**[Chorus]**  
Your hair, colorful like cotton candy  
So cute and lovely, even if you’re not too tall  
Chubby cheeks and fair skin  
A sweet smile, rabbit teeth  
Your hair, colorful like cotton candy  
So cute and lovely, even if you’re not too tall  
Chubby cheeks and fair skin  
A sweet smile, rabbit teeth  
Makes me realize, what love looks like...  
It’s you...

**[Outro]**  
Only you for me  
What love looks like is you  
It’s you...
