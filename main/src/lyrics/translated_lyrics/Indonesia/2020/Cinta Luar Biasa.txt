**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The first time I saw you appear,  
This heart of mine longed for you.  
My heart is calm hearing your beautiful voice greet me,  
The passion in my heart took me by surprise.

[Pre-Chorus]  
This feeling is uncontainable (This feeling...)  
This heart is always for you (This heart...)

[Chorus]  
Accept this song from an ordinary person,  
But my love for you is extraordinary.  
I have no flowers, I have no riches,  
What I possess is only a loyal heart, sincere to you.

[Verse 2]  
(Du du du du du du du)  
Days change, and now love has come,  
Seeing you, gazing at you like an angel.  
The lovely curve of your eyes, the sweet smile of your lips,  
Your long black hair, elegantly tied up.

[Pre-Chorus]  
This feeling is uncontainable (This feeling...)  
This heart is always for you (This heart...)  
(Accept this song)

[Chorus]  
Accept this song from an ordinary person,  
But my love for you is extraordinary.  
I have no flowers, I have no riches,  
What I possess is only a loyal heart, sincere to you.

[Bridge]  
(Restless)  
Oooh...  
(Heart)  
Oooh...  
Accept this song  
From an ordinary person.

[Chorus]  
Accept this song from an ordinary person,  
But my love for you is extraordinary.  
I have no flowers, I have no riches,  
What I possess is only a loyal heart,  
What I possess is only a loyal heart.

[Outro]  
Accept my extraordinary love,  
Sincere to you.
