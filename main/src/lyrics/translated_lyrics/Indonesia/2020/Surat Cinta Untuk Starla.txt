**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I write down the memories of  
How I found you  
About what makes it easy  
To give my heart to you  
A million songs won't be enough  
To tell of your beauty  
The poems will be too long  
To express this love

[Chorus]  
This love has come to an end  
There's nothing left for the world  
Because I've spent it all  
My remaining love is only for you

[Verse 2]  
I once thought about  
My life without you  
Could it be more beautiful than  
What I've lived until now?  
I always dream of  
A beautiful old age with you  
Your long hair still beautiful  
Even when itâ€™s no longer black

[Chorus]  
When this time has run out  
No longer standing in this world  
I have spent  
The rest of my life only for you  
And this love has come to an end  
There's nothing left for the world  
Because I've spent it all  
My remaining love is only for you

[Post-Chorus]  
For you  
My life and my death

[Bridge]  
When the seasons change  
Until time stands still  
Even if the world hates  
I will remain here

[Chorus]  
When this time has run out (When the seasons change)  
No longer standing in this world (Until time stands still)  
I have spent (Even if the world hates)  
The rest of my life only for you (I will remain here)  
This love has come to an end (When the seasons change)  
There's nothing left for the world (Until time stands still)  
Because I've spent it all (Even if the world hates)  
My remaining love is only for you (I will remain here)

[Outro]  
Because I've spent it all  
My remaining love is only for you
