**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Once I fell in love  
With you, wholeheartedly  
I would give my life  
I would go through anything  
But I never dreamed  
You would leave me behind  
Without knowing this feeling  
I want to feel hate instead  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Suddenly you come back  
When you’re already with her  
My heart shatters even more  

[Chorus]  
Don’t come back again, my love  
How can I forget?  
When you know the situation  
You’re not meant for me  
Don’t long for me again, my love  
I don’t want anyone to get hurt  
Make her happy  
I’m okay  
Let me pretend to forget  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Suddenly you come back  
When you’re already with her  
My heart shatters even more  

[Chorus]  
Don’t come back again, my love  
How can I forget?  
When you know the situation  
You’re not meant for me  
Don’t long for me again, my love  
I don’t want anyone to get hurt  
Make her happy  
I’m okay  
Let me pretend to forget  
Don’t come back again, my love  
How can I forget?  
When you know the situation  
You’re not meant for me  
Don’t long for me again, my love  
I don’t want anyone to get hurt  
Make her happy  
I’m okay  
Let me pretend to forget  

[Outro]  
Make her happy  
I’m okay  
Let me pretend to forget
