**Translated Lyrics:**

I'm frustrated with the distance that often separates us  
So I can only chat with you on WhatsApp  
I'm annoyed with time that never stops moving  
Just for a moment, so I can enjoy your laughter  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I want to stand beside you, holding your fingers tight  
Listening to Sheila on 7 like we used to  
When you were by my side  

**[Chorus]**  
So wait for me there, as I break open my jar of longing  
Riding together around the city  
Enjoying the sun slowly fading away  
Until the cruelty of time pulls you from my embrace  
Then we’ll start saving our feelings of longing again  
Sending each other prayers, until later, my love  

**[Verse 2]**  
Don't turn off your phone  
You know I hate worrying  
When you don’t let me know  
I don’t like wondering  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I want to burn the one who keeps mentioning you on Twitter  
But you always reassure me to build trust  
Not suspicion  

**[Chorus]**  
So wait for me there, as I break open my jar of longing  
Riding together around the city  
Enjoying the sun slowly fading away  
Until the cruelty of time pulls you from my embrace  
Then we’ll start saving our feelings of longing again  
Sending each other prayers, until later, my love  

**[Outro]**  
Until we meet again
