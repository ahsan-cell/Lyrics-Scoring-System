**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When I can give you what you want  
What I can do in just a moment  
I give, I give  
But it’s not something new that you desire from me  
All my time must always be with you  
Forgive me, I can't

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know you understand  
My heart is always with you  
Out of seven days, I've given you two days

[Chorus]  
Saturday and Sunday, you’re with me  
Saturday and Sunday, you own me  
Because Saturday and Sunday, I’m yours  
My love for you is more than any other day

[Verse 2]  
There are times I go chasing dreams  
Living day by day and making it more meaningful  
Without you, without you  
But it’s not something new that you desire from me  
All my time must always be with you  
Forgive me, I can't

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know you understand  
My heart is always with you  
Out of seven days, I've given you two days

[Chorus]  
Saturday and Sunday, you’re with me  
Saturday and Sunday, you own me  
Because Saturday and Sunday, I’m yours  
My love for you is more than any other day

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know you understand  
My heart is always with you  
Out of seven days, I've given you two days

[Chorus]  
Saturday and Sunday, you’re with me  
Saturday and Sunday, you own me  
Because Saturday and Sunday, I’m yours  
My love for you is more than any other day
