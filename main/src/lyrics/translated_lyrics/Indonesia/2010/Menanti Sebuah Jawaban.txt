**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I can't soften your heart  
And I can't touch your love  
As the footprints of my steps tremble  
I am captivated by your love  
Infiltrating my days with hope  
Yet you remain silent and still  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Completely, I want to embrace you  
Holding you tight, full of hope to love you  
Sincerely, I will keep waiting  
Awaiting an answer to possess you  

[Verse 2]  
How painful the longing pierces my soul  
I hope you know the contents of my heart  
And as time keeps turning  
I am still lost in my dreams  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Completely, I want to embrace you  
Holding you tight, full of hope to love you  
Sincerely, I will keep waiting  
Awaiting an answer to possess you  

[Instrumental]  

[Chorus]  
Completely, I want to embrace you  
Holding you tight, full of hope to love you  
Sincerely, I will keep waiting  
Awaiting an answer to possess you  

Completely, I want to embrace you  
Holding you tight, full of hope to love you  
Sincerely, I will keep waiting  
Awaiting an answer to possess you  

[Outro]  
I can't soften your heart  
And I can't touch your love
