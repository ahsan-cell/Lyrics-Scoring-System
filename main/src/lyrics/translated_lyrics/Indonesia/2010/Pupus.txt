**Translated Lyrics:**

I don’t understand what I feel  
A longing that has never been this intense  
I love you more than you know  
Even though you’ll never know  
I dedicate my life to you  
I have surrendered my heart to you  
Yet you remain silent, a thousand words unspoken  
And my little heart speaks

[Chorus]  
I’ve just realized  
My love is one-sided  
You’ve shattered my whole heart

[Verse 2]  
I hope time will inspire  
The frozen side of your heart  
I hope a miracle will come  
Until finally, you too will want  
I love you more than you know  
Even though you’ll never know

[Chorus]  
I’ve just realized  
My love is one-sided  
You’ve shattered my whole heart

[Interlude]

[Chorus]  
I’ve just realized  
My love is one-sided  
You’ve shattered my whole heart  
I’ve just realized (I’ve just realized)  
My love is one-sided (One-sided)  
You’ve shattered my whole heart  
(My whole heart)
