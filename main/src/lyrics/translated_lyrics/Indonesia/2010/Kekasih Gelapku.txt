**Translated Lyrics:**

Though no one knows at all,  
I love you with all my heart.  
Even if you are just my secret lover,  
I know I won’t always be there for you.  

When you long for me,  
I know I can’t give you  
A long time in my life.  
Rest assured, you are my love,  
The one I’ve searched for all this time in my life,  
And only to you do I give the rest of my love,  
That lasts throughout my life.  

Oh, my life,  
I love you more than anything,  
Though no one knows at all,  
I love you with all my heart.  
Even if you are just my secret lover.  
Oh... ooo... Wooooww.  

I love you with all my heart,  
Even if you are just my secret lover.  
Loving you more than anything,  
Though no one knows at all,  
I love you with all my heart.  
Even if you are just my secret lover,  
My secret lover.  
Huuuhuu.
