**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Oh, yesterday I saw you  
You met with him  
I think now you’re still  
Thinking about him  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What am I lacking in your life  
That you would betray me?  

[Chorus]  
Just say it now  
That you’re not happy  
I have your body  
But not your heart  
You don’t need to lie  
You still want him  
I’ll let you be with him  
As long as you’re happy  

[Verse 2]  
I feel that now you’re still  
Thinking about him  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What am I lacking in your life  
That you would betray me?  

[Chorus]  
Just say it now  
That you’re not happy  
I have your body  
But not your heart  
You don’t need to lie  
You still want him  
I’ll let you be with him  
As long as you’re happy  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Chorus]  
Just say it now  
That you’re not happy  
I have your body  
But not your heart  
You don’t need to lie  
You still want him  
I’ll let you be with him  
As long as you’re happy  

[Outro]  
As long as you’re happy
