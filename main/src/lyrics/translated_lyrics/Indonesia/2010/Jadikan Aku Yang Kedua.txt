**Translated Lyrics:**

Surpassing my love for you  
I would surely be willing to let you go  
Even though I know I will be hurt  

If everything were different  
You wouldn't be the one I adore  
But my heart has chosen you  
Even if you can never leave it behind  

**Chorus:**  
Make me the second one  
Make me happy  
Even though you will never  
Be mine forever
