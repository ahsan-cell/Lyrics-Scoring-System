**How Worthy Are You for Me to Wait?**

How worthy are you for me to wait?
Are you beautiful enough for me to always anticipate?
Can you be present in every one of my nightmares?
Can we endure when we are far apart?

[Verse 2]  
How great are you for me to take pride in?  
Are you strong enough for me to always rely on?  
Can you withstand my unfortunate life?  
Can you reassure me when I’m filled with doubt?

[Chorus]  
Unfortunately,  
You are the only one I truly wait for.  
You are the only one who really understands me.  
You leave and disappear wherever you please.  
Unfortunately,  
You are the only one worthy of my pride.  
You are the only one I can truly depend on.  
Amidst the pain, I always await you.

[Verse 3]  
How great are you for me to take pride in?  
Are you strong enough for me to always rely on?  
Can you withstand my unfortunate life?  
Can you reassure me when I’m filled with doubt?

[Bridge]  
Maybe now you have vanished without a trace,  
Buried all the beautiful memories.  
But I am always waiting for you here,  
If only you would change your mind.

[Chorus]  
Unfortunately,  
You are the only one I truly wait for.  
You are the only one who really understands me.  
You leave and disappear wherever you please.  
Unfortunately,  
You are the only one worthy of my pride.  
You are the only one I can truly depend on.  
Amidst the pain, I always await you.
