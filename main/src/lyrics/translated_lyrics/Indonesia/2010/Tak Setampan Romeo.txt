**Translated Lyrics:**

Do you dream of me being by your side,  
When all this time you've been far from my grasp?  
I feel pessimistic, thinking this can't be real,  
Hoping this isn't just a fleeting love of yours.  

Maybe I'm not as handsome as Romeo,  
And I don't have riches to boast about,  
But I never expected to find you,  
More beautiful than any Juliet.  

You are now like the most beautiful princess,  
Adorning the flowers in the garden of my soul.  
I realize many desire you,  
Wishing you would be mine forever.  

Maybe I'm not as handsome as Romeo,  
And I don't have riches to boast about,  
But I never expected to find you,  
More beautiful than any Juliet.  

Maybe I'm not as handsome as Romeo,  
And I don't have riches to boast about,  
But I never expected to find you,  
More beautiful than any Juliet.  

Maybe I'm not as handsome as Romeo,  
And I don't have riches to boast about,  
Maybe I'm not as handsome as Romeo,  
And I don't have riches to boast about,  
But I never expected to find you,  
More beautiful than any Juliet.  

But I never expected to find you,  
More beautiful than any Juliet.
