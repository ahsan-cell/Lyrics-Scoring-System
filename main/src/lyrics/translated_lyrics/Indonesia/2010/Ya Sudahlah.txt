**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Bondan Prakoso]  
When your beautiful dreams  
Never come true, well, that's alright  
As you run chasing your hopes  
And never reach them, well, that's alright  
Hm-mm-mm  

[Chorus: Bondan Prakoso, Santoz]  
Whatever happens  
I will always be there for you-u-u  
Don't be sad  
'Cause everything's gonna be okay-ay-ay (Yo, yo)  

[Verse 2: Santoz, Lezzano, Titz, Bondan Prakoso]  
(Yeah) One of many possibilities  
You fall (Fall), without any hope  
At that moment, I offer my being (Yo)  
Along with my soul, dreams, love, and hope  
We connect the dots of cause and effect  
But don't worry, our hearts will see  
Guiding us towards the winds of happiness (Yeah, uh)  
You and I know (Yeah), there's always a way (Yeah, there is)  
I also know that problems will keep crashing  
Like strong waves hitting the rocks  
But I know, I know you can stay calm  
Face this with me until death comes (Mmm, woah)  

[Pre-Chorus: Bondan Prakoso]  
You once hoped for the warmth of love  
But never received it, well, that's alright  
Yeah, hear me sing  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah  
Du-du-du-du-ri-dam, mm-mm  
This isn't over yet  

[Chorus: Bondan Prakoso]  
Whatever happens  
I will always be there for you-u-u  
Don't be sad  
'Cause everything's gonna be oka-a-a-ay  

[Bridge: Fade2Black, Bondan Prakoso, Titz]  
Unite our steps  
Steps that walk in sync (Mm-mm)  
Hold my heart, embrace the emotions (Woah-oh)  
Hold my heart, letâ€™s unite our steps  
With shared feelings, selflessly (Mm-mm)  
This is love, across the sea (Woah-oh)  
Embrace me  
Fly away with me (Yeah)  
Soaring far (You wanna fly?)  
Woah (Wanna fly?)  
Woah, yeah (Come fly with me, baby, uh, uh)  

[Verse 3: Santoz, Titz, Lezzano, Fade2Black, *Bondan Prakoso*]  
Here I am from head to toe  
This figure accepts the weaknesses of the heart (Yeah)  
Yeah, I love you (Huh), this is our love  
Just one moment (Yes), for one love  
This one love will guide my path (Oh)  
Bring your soul close (Yo), calm by my side  
Lay down your feelings (Yeah), for what is awaited  
Happiness (Moving), until the end of time (*Oh, woah*)  

[Chorus: All, Bondan Prakoso]  
Whatever happens  
I will always be there for you  
Don't be sad  
'Cause everything's gonna be okay, yeah  
Whatever happens (Oh, la-la-la-la)  
I will always be there for you (Always there for you)  
Don't be sad (Ooh-oh, don't be sad)  
'Cause everything's gonna be okay (Yeah, hear me sing)  
Whatever happens  
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah)  
(Du-du-du-du-ri-dam, mm-mm, yeah)  
I will always be there for you (Always there for you)  
Don't be sad  
(La-la-la-la-la-la-la, ye-ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah)  
(Du-du-du-du-ri-dam, mm-mm, yeah)  
'Cause everything's gonna be okay (Yeah)  

[Outro: Bondan Prakoso]  
Everything's gonna be okay, yeah
