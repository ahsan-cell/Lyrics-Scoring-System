**Translated Lyrics:**

Praise be to Allah, forever and always,  
All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all worlds,  
For what He has inspired me, all praise belongs to Allah.

O my Lord, send blessings and peace,  
Upon Your beloved, the best of creation.

1. Today’s work and every task that follows,  
May it be a good deed, through the noble Prophet’s grace.  
With us, may You shower Your blessings abundantly,  
Grant us peace and well-being, I humbly ask.

2. Teach us the art, make us sweet as nectar,  
Transform our virtues into a treasure,  
Let our praises rise without end,  
Establish us firmly on the path, O Fatimah, daughter of the Prophet.

3. With the gentleness of the Egyptian breeze,  
And the softness of the Lord, grant us joy,  
In every endeavor, may we find comfort,  
Bestow upon us uncounted blessings, O Fatimah.

4. For our companions and those who surround us,  
Is there anyone like You to help and support?  
As a precious gift, grant us your kindness,  
Providing us with sustenance, O Fatimah.

5. We seek great mercy, O Mother, remove our burdens,  
With Your grace, ease our troubled hearts,  
Listen, O Mother, to our plea for this task,  
Guide us, O Fatimah, with Your blessed presence.

6. Grant us victory, help us in our needs,  
Bestow upon us liberation, through Muhammad, the Messenger,  
To all who seek guidance, be a worthy teacher,  
I hold fast to You, O Fatimah, our leader.

7. Those without respect belittle us,  
They misunderstand and criticize in many ways,  
Standing firm, protect us before all,  
Among those who are righteous, O Fatimah, our guide.

8. By the grace of the Lord, the world flourishes,  
Justice fills the days of Ramadan, especially on Tuesdays,  
In the light of the radiant moon,  
I enter the realm of success, O Fatimah.

The Prophet, his beloved Hasan and Husayn,  
Fatimah and Ali, may they be enveloped in mercy.

O Lord, grant us,  
A meeting with our mother and father,  
In the abode of Paradise, O Most Merciful!  
All praise belongs to Allah, forever and always,  
All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all worlds,  
For what He has inspired me, all praise belongs to Allah.

O my Lord, send blessings and peace,  
Upon Your beloved, the best of creation.
