**Translated Lyrics:**

For so long we've been together  
It turns out you're just the same  
You thought I would believe it all  
All your tricks, oh, what a waste  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You made it perfect at first  
But it ended in disaster  

**[Chorus]**  
Goodbye, my love  
If I live long enough, I will come back  
To prove it, one day you'll see  
Don't cry, my dear  
I want you to feel the bitterness of being cast aside  
It's all in vain, you truly deserve it  

**[Instrumental Interlude]**  

**[Verse 2]**  
Finally, it's all over  
I can laugh now, feeling happy  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It always seemed beautiful at first  
But it ended in disaster...  

**[Chorus]**  
Goodbye, my love  
If I live long enough, I will come back  
To prove it, one day you'll see  
Don't cry, my dear  
I want you to feel the bitterness of being cast aside  
It's all in vain, you truly deserve it  

**[Instrumental Interlude]**  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You made it perfect at first  
But it ended in disaster  

**[Chorus]**  
Goodbye, my love  
If I live long enough, I will come back  
To prove it, one day you'll see clearly  
Don't cry, my dear  
I want you to feel the bitterness of being cast aside  
It's all in vain, you truly deserve it
