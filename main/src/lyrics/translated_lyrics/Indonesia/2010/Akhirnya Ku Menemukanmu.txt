**Translated Lyrics:**

When this heart begins to doubt  
Finally, I have found you  
When this body longs to dock  

I hope you are  
The answer to all my heart's worries  
And let me  
Love you until the end of my days  

If one day I stand beside you  
Embrace me with all my weaknesses  
And when you are by my side  
Never tire of loving me  

Finally, I have found you  
When this heart begins to doubt  
Finally, I have found you  
When this body longs to dock
