**Translated Lyrics:**

I didn’t know at first  
You also want to have him  
Aren't I the one who came first?  
Let you be my friend  
It’s better if you don’t interfere  

[Chorus]  
He’s for me, not for you  
He’s mine, not yours  
Go away, don’t disturb me  
Let me get closer to him  
You will never get him  
Because he has given me signs of love  
Don’t dream too much, oh  
He’s for me  

[Verse 2]  
Isn’t it still uncertain?  
You also might end up with him  
He’s the one who decides  
What will happen  
Don’t try to control me  

[Chorus]  
He’s for me, not for you  
He’s mine, not yours  
Just wait and see, just watch  
Let me get closer to him  
You will never get him  
Because he has given me signs of love  
Don’t dream too much, oh  
Oh, oh  

[Bridge]  
I suggest you just step back, oh, oh  

[Chorus]  
He’s for me, not for you  
He’s mine, not yours  
Go away, don’t disturb me  
Let me get closer to him  
You will never get him  
Because he has given me signs too  
Don’t dream too much  
He’s for me (He’s for me)  
He’s mine (He’s mine)  
Just wait and see, just watch  
Let me get closer to him  
You will never get him  
Because he has given me signs too  
Don’t dream too much, oh  

[Outro]  
He’s for me  
No, he’s for me
