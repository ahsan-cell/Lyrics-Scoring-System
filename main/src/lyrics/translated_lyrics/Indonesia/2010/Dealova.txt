**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I want to be a beautiful dream in your sleep  
I want to be something you might miss  
Because my steps crumble without you  
Oh, because my heart is weary  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want to be something you can always touch  
I want you to know that I always adore you  
Without you, time's loneliness chains my heart  
Oh, your shadow seems to linger  

[Chorus]  
You are like a song in my heart  
Calling out my longing for you  
Like the air that I breathe  
You are always there  

[Pre-Chorus]  
O-o-o-o-oh ...  

[Bridge]  
Only you can bring me peace  
Without you, I feel lost  
And alone  

[Chorus]  
You are like a song in my heart  
Calling out my longing for you  
Like the air that I breathe  
You are always there  

You are like a song in my heart  
Calling out my longing for you, oh  
Like the air that I breathe  
You are always there  

[Outro]  
Always there  
You are always there  
Always there  
You are always there
