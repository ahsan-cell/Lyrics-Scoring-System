**Translated Lyrics:**

When you promised me  
There would never be another love  
It felt so beautiful  

But everything is different  
When you got to know her  
Do you realize that I’m hurt  
When you mention her name?  

I’m just an ordinary person  
Imperfect and sometimes wrong  
Yet in my heart, there’s only one  
An extraordinary love for you  

If only you knew  
I won’t easily change  
I will hold on, always hold on  
Until time calls for me  

*Repeat chorus*  

Where have you gone, the one who loved me?  
Where are you, the one who always missed me?  

*Repeat chorus*  
Yet in my heart, there’s only one  
An extraordinary love for you  
An extraordinary love for you
