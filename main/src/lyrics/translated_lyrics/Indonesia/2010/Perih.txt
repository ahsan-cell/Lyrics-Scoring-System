**Translated Lyrics:**

**You**
You never realized  
All that you have  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You threw me away, left me behind  
You shattered me as if I never existed  

**[Chorus]**  
I will endure  
Even though it seems impossible  
To face this story  
Though it hurts  
Though it hurts  

**[Verse 2]**  
Is it wrong (Is it wrong)  
To love too much?  
Hoping  
That everything will return  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You threw me away, left me behind  
You shattered me as if I never existed  

**[Chorus]**  
I will endure  
Even though it seems impossible  
To face this story  
Though it hurts  
Though it hurts  

**[Instrumental Break]**  

**[Chorus]**  
I will endure  
Even though it seems impossible  
To face this story  
Though it hurts  
Though it hurts  
I will endure  
Even though it seems impossible  
To face this story  
Though it hurts  
Though it hurts  

**[Outro]**  
Though it hurts  
Though it hurts
