**Translated Lyrics:**

Awakening in my solitude  
After walking so far  
The light of your love guides me  
Back into your embrace  

**[Chorus]**  
Thank you, my love, for everything  
You’ve given me that chance again  
It won’t happen again  
All my...  
Mistakes that once hurt you  

**[Verse 2]**  
Without you, I mean nothing  
I can no longer stand  
The light of your love guides me  
Back into your arms  

**[Chorus]**  
Thank you, my love, for everything  
You’ve given me that chance again  
It won’t happen again  
All my...  
Mistakes that once hurt you  

**[Bridge]**  
Uh whoa...  
Uh whoa...  

**[Chorus]**  
Thank you, my love, for everything  
You’ve given me that chance again  
It won’t happen again  
All my...  
Mistakes, oh  
My mistakes  
That once hurt you
