**Translated Lyrics:**

You who have left a mark in the depths of my heart  
The rain falls endlessly, as if a sign  
That love is no longer here  
You have turned away  

**Chorus:**  
Let me keep this feeling, ohh  
Preserving all the love you’ve given me  
You leave, but I won’t go  
You drift away, but I won’t stray  
Truthfully, I still hope for you  

Is there still a light of your longing  
That once always reflected your heart?  
I can’t erase you from my mind  
Even though I see now  
You are over there  

**Repeat Chorus**  

If in the end  
You don’t come back  
I will remain alone  
Guarding my heart  

**Repeat Chorus [3x]**  

Honestly, I still hope for you
