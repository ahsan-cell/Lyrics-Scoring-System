**Translated Lyrics:**

Listen, my beloved woman  
Tonight I will convey  
A pure desire, to you my goddess  
Hear this sincerity of mine  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I want to take you as my wife  
For the first  
And the last  

**[Chorus]**  
Don't reject me and break my heart  
I won't ask again  
This is the certainty of my heart  
I am the best for you  

**[Verse 2]**  
Listen, my dream woman  
Tonight I will convey  
A sacred promise, one for eternity  
Hear this sincerity of mine  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I want to take you as my wife  
For the first  
And the last  

**[Chorus]**  
Don't reject me and break my heart  
I won't ask again  
This is the certainty of my heart  
I am the best for you  

**[Interlude]**  

**[Chorus]**  
Don't reject me and break my heart  
I won't ask again  
This is the certainty of my heart  
I am the best for you  

Don't reject me and break my heart  
I won't ask again  
This is the certainty of my heart  
I am the best for you  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
I am the best for you  
Ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh oh ooh
