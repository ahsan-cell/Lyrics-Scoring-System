**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
How am I doing? I'm just fine  
A little amazed, but honestly, I expected this  
You who come and go, think I'm not enough  
You try to close all my chances and steps  

[Chorus]  
My inner voice will not be wrong  
Feel free to leave, I don't feel defeated  
But believe me, no matter how far you search  
You won't find anyone as good as this  

[Verse 2]  
You who come and go, think I'm not enough  
You try to close all my chances and steps  
I will carve my own path  

[Chorus]  
My inner voice will not be wrong  
Feel free to leave, I don't feel defeated  
But believe me, no matter how far you search  
You won't find anyone as good as this  

[Bridge]  
I'm not perfect  
No need to be perfect  
I will celebrate just as I am  
I'm not perfect  
No need to be perfect  
I will celebrate just as I am  
I'm not perfect  
No need to be perfect  
I will celebrate just as I am  

[Chorus]  
My inner voice will not be wrong  
Feel free to leave, I don't feel defeated  
But believe me, no matter how far you search  
You won't find anyone as good as this  
You won't find anyone as good as this  

[Outro]  
The best soul is only  
Me
