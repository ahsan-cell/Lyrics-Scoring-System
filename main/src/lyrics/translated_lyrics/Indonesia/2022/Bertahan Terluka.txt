**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Is it just my suspicion or is my intuition right  
That you have truly changed?  
Your smile feels different,  
And indeed, there’s another heart that you’re keeping.  
As if I can’t read between the lines,  
You act as if no one is hurt.

[Chorus]  
Do as you please,  
Until you grow tired of hurting me.  
As much as I can, I won’t disturb you,  
I will try to understand you.

[Verse 2]  
And indeed, there’s another heart that you’re keeping,  
As if I can’t read between the lines,  
You act as if no one is hurt.

[Chorus]  
Do as you please,  
Until you grow tired of hurting me.  
As much as I can, I won’t disturb you,  
I will try to understand you.

[Bridge]  
If only you knew my love exceeds this pain,  
Maybe you’d never expect  
Why I’m still here.

[Chorus]  
Do as you please,  
Until you grow tired of hurting me.  
As much as I can, I won’t disturb you,  
I will try.

[Outro]  
(Do as you please) do as you please (Until you grow tired)  
Keep on hurting me.  
As much as I can, I won’t disturb you,  
I will try to understand you.
