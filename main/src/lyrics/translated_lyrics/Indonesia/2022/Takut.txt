**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Already in my twenties,  
Where should I start?  
My ambition is restless,  
Excitement out of control,  
So many dreams that I will chase.  

[Verse 2]  
The twists and turns of the journey,  
I find myself trapped alone,  
Growing from kindness,  
Rising from mistakes,  
Trying to suppress the reality that...  

[Chorus]  
I'm afraid of growing up,  
Afraid I'll be disappointed,  
Afraid it's not as beautiful as I thought,  
I'm afraid of growing up,  
Afraid I'll be disappointed,  
Afraid I'm not as strong as I thought.  

[Post-Chorus]  
I keep breathing,  
Even though I often choke,  
I keep breathing,  
Even though I don't feel free.  

[Verse 3]  
In the middle of twenty-five,  
What comes next?  
So many dreams buried,  
Sacrificing my sleep,  
I donâ€™t know what else I will chase.  

[Chorus]  
I'm afraid of growing up,  
Afraid I'll be disappointed,  
Afraid it's not as beautiful as I thought,  
I'm afraid of growing up,  
Afraid I'll be disappointed,  
Afraid I'm not as strong as I thought.  

[Post-Chorus]  
I keep breathing,  
Even though I often choke,  
I keep breathing,  
Even though I don't feel free.  
Ho-oh, ho-oh  

[Bridge]  
Sorry if  
I haven't met expectations,  
Sorry if  
It seems like I don't know the way.  

[Chorus]  
I have grown up,  
I have been disappointed,  
It really isn't as beautiful as I thought,  
I have grown up,  
I have been disappointed,  
It really isn't as strong as I thought.  

[Post-Chorus]  
I keep breathing,  
Even though I often choke,  
I keep breathing,  
Even though I don't feel free.  
Ho-uh  

[Outro]  
(Afraid I'll be disappointed)  
(Afraid it's not as beautiful as I thought)  
It really isn't as beautiful as I thought,  
It really isn't as strong as I thought.  
You still keep breathing,  
Even though you often choke,  
You still keep breathing,  
And your steps will feel free,  
And your heart will feel free,  
And your soul will feel free.  
Hm-hm-hm-hm-hm,  
Hm-mm
