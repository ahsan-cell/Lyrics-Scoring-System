**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Feby Putri]  
I wake up again in the midst of silence  
Only my thoughts are loud  
Cursing myself for not being able to return  
To change the course of the story  

[Pre-Chorus: Fiersa Besari]  
When they ask for laughter  
It turns out that being willing is not as easy as it sounds  

[Chorus: Feby Putri & Fiersa Besari]  
No need to worry, I'm just hurt  
Used to pretending to laugh  
But, may I cry just this once?  
Before I go back to deceiving myself  

[Verse 2: Fiersa Besari]  
When you’re tired, take a break first  
Give yourself space, give yourself time  

[Pre-Chorus: Feby Putri]  
They say, just be grateful  
But being willing is not as easy as it sounds  

[Chorus: Feby Putri & Fiersa Besari]  
No need to worry, I'm just hurt  
Used to pretending to laugh  
But, may I cry just this once?  
Before I go back to deceiving myself  

[Bridge: Feby Putri & Fiersa Besari]  
Ha-ha-ha-ha  
Ha-ha-ha-ha  
Ha-ha-ha-ha, oh  

[Chorus: Feby Putri & Fiersa Besari]  
We are just wounded humans  
Used to pretending to laugh  
But, may I cry just this once?  
I don’t want to deceive myself anymore  

[Outro: Feby Putri]  
I want to learn to accept myself
