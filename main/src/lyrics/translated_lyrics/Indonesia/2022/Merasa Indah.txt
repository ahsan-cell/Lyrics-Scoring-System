**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Yesterday you revealed your heart  
But it was too late  
You said you couldn't  

[Chorus]  
This love will not be returned  
Darling, I assure you it will drift away  
It hurts when I feel something beautiful  
Everything is lost and over  
If this love isn't real  
Don't give me hope  
I've realized enough now  
I fell too quickly for you  

[Verse 2]  
Now I understand  
You chose him instead  

[Chorus]  
This love will not be returned  
Darling, I assure you it will drift away  
It hurts when I feel something beautiful  
Everything is lost and over  
If this love isn't real  
Don't give me hope  
I've realized enough now  
I fell too quickly for you  

[Bridge]  
You once acted as if you were my soul's refuge  
But what does it mean to choose the wrong heart?  
Ooh-ooh-ooh  
Ha-haa-haa  

[Chorus]  
It hurts when I feel something beautiful  
Everything is lost and over  
If this love isn't real  
Don't give me hope  
I've realized enough now  
I fell too quickly for you, ooh-ooh  
It hurts when I feel something beautiful  
Everything is lost and over  
If this love isn't real  
Don't give me hope  
I've realized enough now  
I fell too quickly for you  
I fell too quickly for you
