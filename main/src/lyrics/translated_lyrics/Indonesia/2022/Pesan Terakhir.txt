**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I've tried, I keep holding on  
To the love that I feel  
I love you, but you don't love me  
I can't bear to keep holding on  

[Verse 2]  
I realize I have no right to force you  
To love me with all your heart  
I will try to forget you  
But please accept my last request  

[Chorus]  
Hold my hand, my dear  
Stay close, embrace me tight  
Stand tall in front of me  
Kiss my forehead for the last time  
I will disappear far from you  
Not a single strand of hair will be seen  
But when you are hurt later on  
Look for me, I’ll be there for you  

[Verse 3]  
I don’t hate you  
I hope you feel the same  
I don’t want you to be far away  
But fate wants us to part ways  

[Chorus]  
Hold my hand, my dear  
Stay close, embrace me tight  
Stand tall in front of me  
Kiss my forehead for the last time  
I will disappear far from you  
Not a single strand of hair will be seen  
But when you are hurt later on  
Look for me, I’ll be there for you  
Hold my hand, my dear  
Stay close, embrace me tight  
Stand tall in front of me  
Kiss my forehead for the last time  
I will disappear far from you  
Not a single strand of hair will be seen  
But when you are hurt later on  
Look for me, I’ll be there for you  

[Outro]  
But when you are hurt later on  
Look for me, I’ll be there for you
