**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The journey brings you  
To meet with me  
I meet you  
Like the one I've been searching for  
They say I am also  
Like the one you seek  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I thought we were like salt and pepper  
And we met in the pot  
A story that turned out not to be so beautiful  

[Chorus]  
I thought we would be together  
So many things in common  
Your background and mine  
I thought there would be no obstacles  
I thought this would be easy  
You and I become us  

[Verse 2]  
Your love leaves a mark  
Now it has faded  
A special spark  
What does the world mean?  
About the end of the story  
We are not together  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I hope this longing disappears  
They say time heals  
Will there be another like you?  

[Chorus]  
I thought we would be together  
So many things in common  
Your background and mine  
I thought there would be no obstacles  
I thought this would be easy  
You and I become us  

[Bridge]  
You continue your journey  
I continue my journey  
Uh-uhh, Uh  

[Chorus]  
I thought we would be together  
So many things in common  
Your background and mine  
I thought there would be no obstacles  
I thought this would be easy  
You and I become us  
I thought we would be together  

[Outro]  
Take care on the road
