**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Now I understand  
All of this is happening  
Undeniably  
You're the only one I have  
The earth in silence  
You won't be alone  
I'm here waiting for you to return  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If only I could hold your hand  
There would be no word for longing in my heart  

[Chorus]  
Do you know how much I  
Miss your presence, being here?  
Believe me, my love, distance and time can't erase  
The promise to keep my heart safe  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If only I could hold your hand  
There would be no word for longing in my heart  

[Chorus]  
Do you know how much I  
Miss your presence, being here?  
Believe me, my love, distance and time can't erase  
The promise to keep my heart safe  

[Bridge]  
The rain falls, representing my heart  
The wind blows, depicting my restlessness, oh  
But now the rainbow  
Comes to shine upon us  

[Chorus]  
Missing your presence, being here  
Believe me, my love, distance and time can't erase  
The promise to keep my heart safe  
Missing your presence, being here  
Believe me, oh my love, distance and time can't erase  
The promise to keep my heart safe
