**Translated Lyrics:**

If I have to remember you again  
I won’t be able to bear what happened between us  
If forgetting you were easy  
It wouldn’t be heavy, it wouldn’t tire my heart  

[Bridge]  
I admit, I’ve lost  
This love is bitter and doesn’t have to be possessed  

[Chorus]  
If I could, I would go back  
I would change the fate of the love I chose  
Even though it’s impossible, even if I want to  
Take you through a time machine  

[Verse 2]  
If forgetting you were easy  
It wouldn’t be heavy, it wouldn’t tire my heart  
A long journey that I must go through  
Letting you go  

[Chorus]  
If I could, I would go back  
I would change the fate of the love I chose  
Even though it’s impossible, even if I want to  
Take you through a time machine, ho-uh-oh  
Wo-uh-oh  

If I could, I would go back  
I would change the fate of the love I chose  
Even though it’s impossible, even if I want to  
Take you, oh-oh  

If I could, I would go back  
I would change the fate of the love I chose  
Even though it’s impossible, even if I want to  
Take you through a time machine
