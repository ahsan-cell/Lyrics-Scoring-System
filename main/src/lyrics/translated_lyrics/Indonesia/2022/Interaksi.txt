**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
How was I to know this day would come,  
The day I’d see him,  
The one I never aimed for,  
The one I never sought,  
Guess the seeds of heartbreak sprout again.  

[Chorus]  
If I had known,  
If I could choose, I’d surely avoid meeting you,  
That’s what I’d pick,  
If I could steer clear of this interaction,  
That’s what I’d choose.  

[Verse 2]  
I want to take him to beautiful places,  
A typical cliché, wanting to know his thoughts,  
Whether it’s desire or love,  
My fragile heart dares the ride.  

[Chorus]  
Oh, once again, I’m out of control in this melancholic oasis,  
That’s what I’d choose, hmm,  
I can’t help but manage my heart,  
Not everything is my choice.  

[Bridge]  
Nature and all its energy,  
Is there a place for me in its creation?  
If not for me,  
Please keep me away from that heartbreak.  

[Chorus]  
If he truly is meant for me here,  
Come closer and closer,  
And if he’s not meant for me, please...  

[Outro]  
Calm down and settle,  
Calm down and settle,  
Calm down and settle,  
Or come closer.
