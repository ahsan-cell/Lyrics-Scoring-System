**Translated Lyrics:**

After all this time we've been through  
Passing moments that truly matter  
♪  
Now, I am certain of one heart  
That feels just right to accompany me  
From now until I grow old  
I want a home to share our love  
You called "mother," while I am "father"  
Exchanging stories in the family room  
Chatting and cradling our little one  
So simple  
This happiness is complete  
Together  
Until the day we close our eyes  
♪  
Ha-ah  
Ha-ah  
Ha-ah  
I want a home to share our love  
You called "mother," while I am "father"  
Exchanging stories until we drift to sleep  
Then morning comes, you cook, I go to work  
So simple  
This happiness is complete  
Together  
Until our time on earth is done  
Hopefully  
Our good intentions will soon come true  
As long as we  
Believe He is the Almighty  
Don't tire yet, trust that all is beautiful  
Close your eyes, to Him we surrender
