**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I don't know how many Tuesdays have passed  
Yet you still linger, stuck in my mind  
Today I promise to forget by tomorrow  
But my heart doesn't keep that vow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Slap me on the cheek  
So I can wake up and understand  

[Chorus]  
Let the rain hide its downpour  
Close my eyes to the tears  
Accompany my long-held sorrow  
Is it a sin for me to pray?  
Wishing you would hurt  
And leave her behind  

[Verse 2]  
Today I promise to forget by tomorrow  
But my heart doesn't keep that vow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Slap me on the cheek  
So I can wake up and understand  

[Chorus]  
Let the rain hide its downpour  
Close my eyes to the tears  
Accompany my long-held sorrow  
Is it a sin for me to pray?  
Wishing you would hurt  
And leave her behind  

[Bridge]  
It's not that I don't try  
(I try) Huu  

[Chorus]  
Let the rain hide its downpour  
Close my eyes to the tears  
Accompany my long-held sorrow  
Is it a sin for me to pray?  
Wishing you would hurt  
And leave her behind  
Let the rain hide its downpour  
Close my eyes to the tears  
Three years have flown by  
And still, it's you who remains  
The real fool is me  

[Outro]  
Slap me on the cheek  
Wake me up, so this won't happen again
