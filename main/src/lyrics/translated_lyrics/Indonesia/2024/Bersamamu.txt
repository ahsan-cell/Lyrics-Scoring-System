**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse One]

I want you to feel the love that I feel (feel it)  
And let it all, my love fill your heart (fill my heart...)  
I weave beautiful words into a name, so you know what I feel...  
I feel love when I'm near you, a beautiful love for you, the most beautiful in my heart  

Listen...  
The whispers of your heart, I speak beautiful love for you to live the most beautiful life together  
You become eternal forever  

With you...  

[Drop+Lyric]  

I weave beautiful words into a name, so you know what I feel...  

I feel love when I'm near you, a beautiful love for you, the most beautiful in my heart (2x)  
To live the most beautiful life together  
You become eternal forever...  

[Drop+Lyric]  

With you...  
With you...  
With you...  
With you...  
With you...  
With you...
