**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When your heart is hurt  
I am the one who stays by your side  
Wiping away your tears  

[Verse 2]  
But why is it that when  
Your heart has smiled again  
I am the one you forget  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Have you not realized all this time  
That I have always wanted you too?  

[Chorus]  
Why is it so hard for me to have your heart?  
Even all this time, my presence means nothing to you  
What’s happening now is that I’m just a temporary shelter  
When you’re in pain  
And when everything calms down  
You disappear just like that  

[Bridge]  
If there really is no hope  
Why must I be the one you turn to?  
When your heart is hurt  
I am the remedy  
Yet you never appreciate  
This love and affection so sincere  

[Chorus]  
Why is it so hard  
Why is it so hard for me to have your heart?  
Even all this time, my presence means nothing to you  
What’s happening now is that I’m just a temporary shelter  
When you’re in pain  
And when everything calms down  
You disappear just like that  

[Outro]  
And when everything calms down  
You disappear just like that
