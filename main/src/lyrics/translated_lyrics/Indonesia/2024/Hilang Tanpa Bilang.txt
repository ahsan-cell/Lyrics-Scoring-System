**Translated Lyrics:**

I keep on fighting  
Against this long longing  
I always stay patient  
Waiting for you, who vanished without a trace  

[Verse 1]  
They say to forget  
You who have long gone  
And start moving on with life  
End this sadness of mine  
But I believe in my heart  
It's slowly killing me  

[Chorus]  
I keep on fighting  
Against this long longing  
I always stay patient  
Waiting for you, who is lost  
I keep on fighting  
Against this long longing  
I always stay patient  
Waiting for you, who vanished without a trace  

[Verse 2]  
You are the chasm between loyalty and madness  
Just a hope that may never become reality  
You are the bitterness but not the regret  
A valuable lesson in life  
No, you are not a failure  
Is there anyone who stays sane when in love?  
While I can only touch you through prayer  
What if over there you find someone and are happy?  
Did I ever mean anything to you?  

[Chorus]  
I keep on fighting  
Against this long longing  
I always stay patient  
Waiting for you, who is lost  
I keep on fighting  
Against this long longing  
I always stay patient  
Waiting for you, who vanished without a trace  
Waiting for you, who vanished without a trace
