**Translated Lyrics:**

Could it be? Could it be? Could it be  
You stop by today?  
If not, just like you, be a sunflower  

That suddenly blooms in the garden  
Even if it speaks the language of plants  
Tell me  
What’s your new home like?  

[Verse]  
Are those rivers really crossed with milk?  
And is your body no longer in pain?  
Are you and the people there young again?  
All these questions, find the answers  
A joyful heart, you often laugh  
Is it true what they say, that you love to joke?  

[Chorus]  
Could it be? Could it be? Could it be  
You stop by today?  
If not, just like you, be a sunflower  

That suddenly blooms in the garden  
Even if it speaks the language of plants  
I’ll tell you  
How my life is without you  

[Post-Chorus]  
I still miss you every moment  
Sometimes I cry when I need to  
But now I’m funnier than before  
Be as joyful as you said  

Live life with full delight  
And believe you’re in my heart forever, oh  

[Chorus]  
Could it be? Could it be? Could it be  
You stop by today?  
If not, just like you, be a sunflower  

Could it be? Could it be? Could it be  
You stop by today?  
If not now, I promise we will meet again.
