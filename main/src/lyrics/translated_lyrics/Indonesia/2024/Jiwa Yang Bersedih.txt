**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Come here,  
Stop for a moment,  
Your journey is long,  
There’s no place to take shelter.  

[Verse 2]  
Cry out,  
For you are human too,  
Who can truly  
Go on forever,  
Pretending to be perfect?  

[Chorus]  
Tell the soul that is sad,  
How cold is the world you inhabit.  
If there’s no place for you to return,  
Bring your wounds, let me heal them.  
Aren’t your feet tired from running?  
There are things they don’t understand.  
Give yourself time to lean for a bit,  
All this time you’ve been great,  
It’s just that you haven’t been heard.  

[Verse 3]  
Cry out,  
For you are human too,  
Who can truly  
Go on forever,  
Pretending to be perfect?  

[Chorus]  
Tell the soul that is sad,  
How cold is the world you inhabit.  
If there’s no place for you to return,  
Bring your wounds, let me heal them.  
Aren’t your feet tired from running?  
There are things they don’t understand.  
Give yourself time to lean for a bit,  
All this time you’ve been great,  
It’s just that you haven’t been heard.  

[Interlude]  
Huu, huu  
Hoo, hoo  

[Chorus 3]  
Tell the soul that is sad,  
How cold is the world you inhabit.  
If there’s no place for you to return,  
Bring your wounds, let me heal them.  
Aren’t your feet tired from running?  
There are things they don’t understand.  
Give yourself time to lean for a bit,  
All this time you’ve been great,  
It’s just that you haven’t been heard.  

[Outro]  
All this time you’ve been great,  
You will surely be heard.
