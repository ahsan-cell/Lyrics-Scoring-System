**Translated Lyrics:**

Standing here  
I turn back time  
Remembering  
You from before  

You were by my side every day  
The most comforting support  
When I was weak, when I was tired  
Ho wo wo  

Awakening  
I find myself alone  
Reflecting  
On all that’s impossible  

If only I could rewind it back to how it was  
I’m happy, but everything vanished without a reason  
You stopped it all  
Ho oh oh  

Hurt and crying, but I accept  
All the decisions you’ve made  
One thing you must know  
I’m waiting for you to return  

Honestly, I don’t want you to go  
Leaving everything behind here  
These tears can’t be held back  
Remembering all that has happened  

I know you feel the same as I do  
Not wanting our love to end here  
But maybe this is the way  
We have to part, ho oh ho  

Hurt and crying, but I accept  
All the decisions you’ve made  
One thing you must know  
I’m waiting for you to return  

Ho ho wo oh  
Leaving everything behind here  

I know you feel the same as I do  
Not wanting our love to end here  
But maybe this is the way  
We have to part, ho oh  
Hoping that someday  
You and I will meet again  
Just like you said  
Before you left me
