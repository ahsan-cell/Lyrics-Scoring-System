**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Seeing you happy, the most beautiful thing  
A gift of love that I once had  
You made me believe in the sincerity of love  
As if a perfect story is about to come  

I still clearly remember, your warm embrace  
As if nothing could ever fade away  
Now it's just a memory, that you've left behind  
No more time together remains  

[Chorus]  
Why is there still?  
A lingering feeling in my heart  
When you left so suddenly  
Can I endure?  
Without your presence, my love  
God, send my longing to her (longing to her)  

[Verse 2]  
I still clearly remember (clearly remember), your warm embrace  
As if nothing could ever fade away (fade away)  
Now it's just a memory, that you've left behind  
No more time together remains (time together)  

[Chorus]  
Why is there still? (ooh…)  
A lingering feeling in my heart  
When you left so suddenly (so suddenly)  
Can I endure?  
Without your presence, my love  
God, send my longing to her  

[Bridge]  
(Still stored) Oh, still stored  
Every memory (ooh…)  
All the love you gave  
You cannot be replaced  

[Chorus]  
Why is there still? (still there)  
A lingering feeling in my heart (feeling in my heart)  
When you left so suddenly  
Can I endure? (without your presence, my love)  
God, send my longing to her  
Send my longing to her
