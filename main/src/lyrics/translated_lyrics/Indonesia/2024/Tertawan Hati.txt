**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I've tried with all my heart  
To be an angel  
Pushing aside my feelings  
Crushing my ego  
But my wings are broken  

[Verse 2]  
When I ask myself  
Why do I hold on?  
Accepting a situation that's not good  
Forcing everything  

[Chorus]  
It hurts  
I can't bear it  
Do we realize we're too shattered?  
Lost  
Gone without a trace  
Yet I can't bring myself to surrender  
My heart is captive  

[Bridge]  
I don't want to lose  
But I'm tired of fighting  
Isn't home where I can lean?  
Alone, I can't manage  
Together, we suffer  
This is the reality that we're not okay  

[Chorus]  
It hurts  
I can't bear it  
Do we realize we're too shattered?  
Lost  
Gone without a trace  
Yet I can't bring myself to surrender  
My heart is captive
