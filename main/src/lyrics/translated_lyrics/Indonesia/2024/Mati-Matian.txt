**Translated Lyrics:**

At the beginning, our story was created  
Your sweet words left me in awe  
To me, you are perfect  
It’s true what they all say  
I’ve been blinded by love  
Not just once have you betrayed me  
I can’t take it anymore, I’ve had enough  

I fought hard to defend you in front of them  
Even though it hurts, I still believe you’re different from the rest  
I’ve been completely deceived, yet this love remains the same  
God, is this love or foolishness?  

I’m exhausted with your behavior  
Time and again, I’ve forgiven you  
And again, you do it, ah  
My one and only pride  
Now turned into the deepest pain  

I fought hard to defend you in front of them  
I fought hard to defend you in front of them  
Even though it hurts, I still believe you’re different from the rest  
I’ve been completely deceived, yet this love remains the same  
God, is this love or foolishness?  

Oh, oh  
Even though it hurts, I still believe you’re different from the rest  
I’ve been completely deceived, yet this love remains the same  
God, is this love or foolishness?  
Oh God, is this love or foolishness?
