**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Time after time  
Day after day  
I realize I’m all alone  
You’ve gone so far away  
Leaving me behind  
It turns out I miss you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The smile that always wraps my wounded heart  
In front of them  
God, am I still worthy to be with her?  
Because this heart desires her  

[Chorus]  
It’s not that easy to find someone to replace you  
It’s not that simple to discover a figure like you, my love  
You know how deep the love I planted for you is  
Why did you choose to part ways?  

[Bridge]  
I placed too much hope in you  
That’s why I’ve been so long without you  
They say I’ll find someone better than you  
But that’s impossible  
None of it is easy  

[Chorus]  
I’m searching for someone to replace you  
It’s not that easy to find a figure like you, oh, my love  
You know how deep the love I planted for you is  
Why did you choose to part ways?  
I’m searching for someone to replace you  
A figure like you, my love  
You know how deep the love I planted for you is  
Why did you choose to part ways?  
You chose to part ways.
