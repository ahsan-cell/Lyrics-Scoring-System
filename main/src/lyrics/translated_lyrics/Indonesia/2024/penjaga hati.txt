**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Unknowingly, I found  
Found a beautiful woman who awakens me  
She is none other than  
Only her  

[Verse 2]  
She makes me feel at ease  
In the warmth of her embrace  
She understands what I feel  
Only her  

[Chorus]  
I will cross seven seas and oceans  
I will climb the Himalayas  
I will do anything for you, my love  
Oh, guardian of my heart  

[Verse 3]  
You and I are perfect  
I hope there’s a way to stay together  
I will always wait, I don’t want to let go  
You and I  

[Chorus]  
I will cross seven seas and oceans  
I will climb the Himalayas  
I will do anything for you, my love  
Oh, guardian of my heart  
Woah-oh  

[Guitar Break]  

[Chorus]  
I will cross seven seas and oceans  
I will climb the Himalayas  
I will do anything for you, my love  
Oh, guardian of my heart  
Woah-oh  
Because with you, everything feels beautiful  
The turmoil in my heart has vanished  
My promise is I will never let you go, oh my angel from heaven  
Forever  
Forever  
Forever
