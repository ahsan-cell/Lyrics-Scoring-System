**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Once the eyes have seen  
Once the ears have heard  
Once the body has felt  
Clearly recorded, as if it just happened, hm-mm  

[Verse 2]  
Who is to blame?  
Who is responsible?  
Time keeps moving on  
It feels wrong because something remains unfinished, oh-oh-oh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m no longer angry  
Though I still remember  
Everything that happened yesterday  
Made me who I am today  
I’m no longer hateful  
Even though I’ve suffered loss  
Whether or not the apology is heard  
My heart is open to accept it all  

[Chorus]  
There will be a future  
For all who endure  
My world once shattered  
Piecing it back together, one by one  

[Interlude]  
(Hu-hu-hu-hu-uh)  
(Hu-hu-hu-hu-uh)  

[Bridge]  
Not everyone will understand  
Hm, and not everyone will say  
Sorry, everything had to happen (surely the feeling of loneliness)  
Now you’re not alone anymore (no more holding back)  
I will try to understand, oh-oh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m no longer angry  
Though I still remember  
Everything that happened yesterday  
Made me who I am today  
I’m no longer hateful  
Even though I’ve suffered loss  
Whether or not the apology is heard  
My heart is open to accept it all  

[Chorus]  
There will be (there will be)  
A future (a future)  
For all who endure  
My world once shattered  
Piecing it back together, one by one  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Chorus]  
There will be (there will be)  
A future (a future)  
For all who endure  
My world once shattered  
Piecing it back together, one by one, ho-oh  
(There will be a future)  
(For all who endure) there will be a future  
(My world once shattered)  
Piecing it back together (one by one), hu-uh  
Piecing it back together  
Piecing it back together
