**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
My child, when someday  
You listen to this song  
And I am no longer by your side  
You will understand  
Why I was so annoying in your eyes  

[Verse 2]  
My child, if the time comes  
When you live alone  
And the world turns out  
Not as you hoped  
I am here  
Being the home that always awaits your return  

[Pro-Chorus]  
One day you will become  
A parent like me  
Who wants their child  
To be happy with their life  

[Chorus]  
If my little outbursts  
Break your heart  
Harder than that  
The world will judge you  
I shaped you into  
Who you are today  
You must be strong  
You must be great  
My precious gem  

[Verse 3]  
My child, the time will come  
You must choose your own path  
Which may not align and be beautiful in my eyes  
If it happens  
Promise me you will always be yourself  

[Pro-Chorus]  
One day you will become  
A parent like me  
Who wants their child  
To have power over their life  

[Chorus]  
If my little outbursts  
Break your heart  
Harder than that  
The world will judge you  
I shaped you into  
Who you are today  
You must be strong  
You must be great  
My precious gem  

[Interlude]  
[Chorus]  
If my little outbursts  
Break your heart  
Harder than that  
The world will judge you  
I shaped you into  
Who you are today  
You must be strong  
You must be great  

[Outro]  
I am the fingers  
And your mother is the pen  
And you are the most beautiful poem ever created  
May my gentle caress  
Soften your heart  
You must be proud  
You must be beautiful  
You must be strong  
You must be great  

MY PRECIOUS GEM...
