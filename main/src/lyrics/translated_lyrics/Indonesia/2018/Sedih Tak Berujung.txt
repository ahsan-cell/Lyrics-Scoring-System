**Translated Lyrics:**

As the days of your happiness approach,  
I choose to remain silent in my solitude.  

While they laugh over my pain,  
About the love that has left me behind,  
I don’t care,  
Truly don’t care,  
This is my path in life.  

Here I am, you hold my heart,  
Keep it deep within your soul.  
There’s nothing left for me, all feelings are gone from my chest.  
Goodbye, an endless story,  
Now I will stop hoping,  
This farewell is for me,  
It will become a never-ending sad tale.  

Here I am, you hold my heart,  
Keep it deep within your soul.  
There’s nothing left for me, all feelings are gone from my chest.  
Goodbye, an endless story,  
Now I will stop hoping,  
This farewell is for me,  
It will become a never-ending sad tale.
