**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1**  
For thousands of days, I've waited for you  
Millions of songs have been created for you  
Will you continue like this?  
Is there still a space in your heart  
Where I can find a place to stay?  
Try me whenever you want  

**Chorus**  
Do you know the song that you love?  
Do you know the star that you greet?  
Do you know the home that you seek?  
That's me  
Do you know the song that you love?  
Do you know the star that you greet?  
Do you know the home that you seek?  
That's me  

**Verse 2**  
Try stepping out in the stormy night  
Sing the song that you love  
Then you'll feel the coolness around you  
Try stepping out in the blazing day  
Remember the star that you greet  
Then you'll feel the warmth surrounding you  

**Chorus**  
Do you know the song that you love?  
Do you know the star that you greet?  
Do you know the home that you seek?  
That's me  
Do you know the song that you love?  
Do you know the star that you greet?  
Do you know the home that you seek?  
That's me  

**Interlude**  
Believe me, that's me, oh  
Believe me, that's me, oh  

**Break**  
Du-du-du-du-du, du-du, du-du-du-du-du, ah  
That's me  
Du-du-du-du-du, du-du, du-du-du-du-du, ah  
That's me  

**Chorus**  
Do you know the song that you love?  
Do you know the star that you greet?  
Do you know the home that you seek?  
That's me  

**Outro**  
Du-du-du-du-du, du-du, du-du-du-du-du, ah, ah  
Hey, that's me, hey  
Hey, that's me, hey  
Hey, that's me, hey  
Hey, that's me, hey  
Hey, that's me, hey  
Hey, that's me, hey  
Hey, that's me, hey
