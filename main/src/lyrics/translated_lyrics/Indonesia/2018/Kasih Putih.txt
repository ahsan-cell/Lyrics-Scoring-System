**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The deepest feelings I've ever known  
My desire is only for you  
Sweetly etched  
In my contemplation  
Your soul, my soul unite  

[Chorus]  
Let me feel  
The warmth of your loving touch  
Take me to fill me  
Grant me  
Pure love in my heart  
(I come to you, my beloved)  

[Verse 2]  
I pour out the essence of my soul  
Only to you  
In that water  
You carry me forever  

[Chorus]  
Let me feel  
The warmth of your loving touch  
Take me to fill me  
Grant me  
Pure love in my heart  

[Bridge]  
(Hug me, oh my love)  
(Shower me with love)  
(Let me feel)  
(The warmth of your loving touch)  
(Take me to fill me)  
(Grant me your love)  

[Chorus]  
Let me feel  
The warmth of your loving touch  
Take me to fill me  
Grant me  
Pure love in my heart  
Let me feel  
The warmth of your loving touch  
Take me to fill me  
Grant me  
Pure love in my heart  

[Outro]  
(I find the meaning of my life)  
With you
