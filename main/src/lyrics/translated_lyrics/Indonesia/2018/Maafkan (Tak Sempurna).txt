**Translated Lyrics:**

In your heart for me  
And I respond to your deep love  
With a smile on my lips  
Everything is beautiful, feels like a dream  

And the days go by  
Testing my love for you  
I have given all my love  
And my heart to you  
But you always demand more from me  
Until I don’t know what else to do  

Forgive me for not being perfect  
No matter how long, I will remain this way  
I just want to always  
Be the best for you  

Huuuu, not perfect, not perfect  
Huuuu, not perfect, not perfect  

If only I could be someone  
Like you want me to be  
So that my love  
Is irreplaceable by any other  
Because you always demand more from me  
Until I don’t know what else to do  

Forgive me for not being perfect  
No matter how long, I will remain this way  
I just want to always  
Be the best for you  

Huuuu, not perfect, not perfect  
Nana na, not perfect, not perfect  
Bei beibei, not perfect, not perfect  
Du dud duu, not perfect, not perfect  

Forgive me for not being perfect  
No matter how long, I will remain this way  
I just want to always  
Be the best for you  
Forgive me for not being perfect  
No matter how long, I will remain this way  
I just want to always  
Be the best for you  

Not perfect, not perfect  
Huuuu, not perfect, not perfect
