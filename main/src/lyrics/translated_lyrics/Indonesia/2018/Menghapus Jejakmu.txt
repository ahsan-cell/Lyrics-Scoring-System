**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I keep moving, trying to forget you  
My heart is weary from watching your ways  
Your thoughts make me doubt  
This can't possibly last  
Slowly, dreams start to disturb me  
I try to keep my distance  
Gradually, my heart feels trapped  
I try to continue living  

[Chorus]  
You are not my everything  
Not the place to stop my steps  
It's all over, everything has passed  
Let the rain wash away your traces  

[Verse 2]  
I keep moving, trying to forget you  
My heart is weary from watching your ways  
Your thoughts make me doubt  
This can't possibly last  
Slowly, dreams start to disturb me  
I try to keep my distance  
Gradually, my heart feels trapped  
I try to continue living  

[Chorus]  
You are not my everything  
Not the place to stop my steps  
It's all over, everything has passed  
Let the rain wash away your traces  

[Bridge]  
Let go of everything  
Let go of everything  

[Chorus]  
You are not my everything  
Not the place to stop my steps  
It's all over, everything has passed  
Let the rain wash away your traces  
You are not my everything  
Not the place to stop my steps  
It's all over, everything has passed  
Let the rain wash away your traces  

[Outro]  
Na-na-na-na-na, na-nana-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na, na-nana-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na, na-nana-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na, na-nana-na-na
