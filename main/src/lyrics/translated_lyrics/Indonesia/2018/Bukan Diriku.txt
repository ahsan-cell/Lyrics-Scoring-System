**Translated Lyrics:**

I am not the best  
That exists in your heart  

I cannot doubt  
It turns out it is she  
Who understands you  
Not me  

Now forgive me  
If I have become silent  
Towards you  

Itâ€™s not that my kindness is muted  
Only my heart has limits  
To understand you  
Forgive me  

**Chorus:**  
Though I still love you  
I must leave you  
I have to forget you  
Even though my heart cherishes you  
My conscience needs you  
I must let you go  

And it is only you  
Who can understand me  
Who can truly see me  

It turns out it is she  
Who is able to praise you  
Who has long touched you  
Not me  

**(Repeat Chorus)**
