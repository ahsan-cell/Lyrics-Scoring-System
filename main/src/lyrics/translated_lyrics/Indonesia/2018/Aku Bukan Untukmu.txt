**Translated Lyrics:**

Once you desired me  
Even though I never answered you  
You had no intention of leaving me  

Now you’re drifting away  
Now you’re leaving me  
Just as I began to hope for you  
And I beg you, forgive me  

I regret making you cry  
And letting you choose someone else  
But never deceive your destiny  
It must be what’s best for you  

Don’t remember me anymore  
I’m not meant for you  
Even though I plead and ask for your heart  
Never leave him  
For my sake  

Now you’re drifting away  
Now you’re leaving me  
Just as I began to hope for you  
And I beg you, forgive me  

I regret making you cry  
And letting you choose someone else  
But never deceive your destiny  
It must be what’s best for you  

Don’t remember me anymore  
I’m not meant for you  
Even though I plead and ask for your heart  
Never leave him  

Even though I plead and ask for your heart  
Never leave him  
For my sake
