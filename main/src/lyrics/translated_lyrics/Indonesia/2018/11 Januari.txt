**Translated Lyrics:**

**January Eleventh, we meet**  
**Living this love story**  
**My instinct tells me you are mine**  
**Happiness is always within reach**  
**Years spent together with you**  
**I declare that you are my soul**  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
**I am your guardian**  
**I am your protector**  
**I am your companion**  
**In every step you take**  

**[Verse 2]**  
**I have hurt your heart before**  
**You have forgotten this promise**  
**All because we are only human**  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
**I am your guardian**  
**I am your protector**  
**I am your companion**  
**In every step you take**  

**[Chorus]**  
**You bring me into your life**  
**You wash me with your love**  
**Your smile and your sadness are my life**  
**You touch my love gently**  
**With a million colors**  

**[Instrumental]**  
**Ooooh ooooh**  

**[Chorus]**  
**You bring me into your life**  
**You wash me with your love**  
**Your smile and your sadness are my life**  
**You touch my love gently**  
**With a million colors**
