**Translated Lyrics:**

The one I love  
Why have you been gone so long  
From my sight here?  

Don’t make me smile  
When there’s no passion  
I want to always be with you.  

Now I’m restless  
I feel weak without you... ohh  

Reach for all my fingers  
Embrace me in your happiness  
I want to be together forever, just the two of us.  

If I open my eyes  
I want you to always be there  
In this weak heart of mine  
With you, I am strong.
