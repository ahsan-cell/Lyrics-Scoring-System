**Translated Lyrics:**

Carried by the river to the edge of my sight  
And I begin to fear being swept away by love  
Inhaling longing that tightens my chest  
My path feels empty, and I reach for you  
It feels warm, oh, deep in my heart  
I hold on tight and try to stop time  
Yet still, I see you walk away  
I never doubted and always remember  
The glimmer in your eyes and your warm touch  
At that moment, I was afraid to seek meaning  
To nurture feelings that tighten my chest  

[Chorus]  
You come and go, oh, just like that  
I accept everything as it is  
Eyes closed, and my heart murmurs  
In the space of longing, we meet  
You come and go, oh, just like that  
I accept everything as it is  
Eyes closed, and my heart murmurs  
In the space of longing, we meet  

Meeting
