**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, yeah  
J-Flow right here  
Vidi, drop the voice, come on  

[Verse 1]  
Oh, nothing is as great and captivating  
As when you walk past me  
Just ordinary  
The time of introduction has already passed  
There’s something intriguing in your aura  
That keeps bothering me  
Hearing everyday stories  
That are normal yet still delightful  

[Chorus]  
Now it truly feels  
The further you are  
The closer it seems  
I will nurture  
The love you’ve planted  
In my heart  

[Verse 2: J-Flow, Vidi]  
Right here baby  
Break it down, break it down  
Vidi, come on, oh  
Oh, there’s no surprise in your charm  
The first time I held your hand  
Just ordinary  
The bond has already formed  
There’s something captivating about your shadow  
I don’t want to leave  
You are the essence of inspiration  
An endless stretch of sea  

[Chorus]  
Now it truly feels  
The further you are  
The closer it seems  
I will nurture  
The love you’ve planted  
In my heart  

[Verse 3: J-Flow, Vidi]  
Ah, ah, you know, the further that you go  
The closer it feels  
The feeling that you show, is that how heaven feels?  
Seconds pass by, minute after minute  
I was too shy, my words  
Words have been erased  
I fell silent and could only say bla bla bla  
Like a shooting star, I  
Make a wish like la la la  
My pressure is gone  
My treasure is found  
My baby girl, you really  
Make my world go around  
Gazing at the essence, (aha) the clear essence  
Break it down V  
Clearly, a prayer of love  
Sing for the ladies, come on  

[Chorus: Vidi, J-Flow]  
Now it truly feels  
The further you are  
The closer it seems  
Just as far as we go, just as close as we feel  
I will nurture  
The love you’ve planted  
Right here in my heart, right here in my mind  
In my heart  

[Chorus]  
Now it truly feels  
The further you are  
The closer it seems  
I will nurture  
The love you’ve planted  
In my heart  

[Outro: J-Flow, Vidi]  
Right here, baby  
Right here, baby  
Vidi, come on  
Now it truly feels  
Come on boy  
Break it down, break it down  
Come on  
Now it truly feels  
J-Flow right here
