**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Time feels like it's slipping away  
Leaving behind the story of us  
There will be no more laughter now  
To erase all the loneliness in my heart  

[Chorus]  
There’s a story about me and her  
And how we were together in days gone by  
There’s a story about beautiful times  
When we mourned and when we laughed  

[Instrumental]  

[Bridge]  
I remember the moments we laughed together  
Telling everything about us  

[Chorus]  
There’s a story about me and her  
And how we were together in days gone by  
There’s a story about beautiful times  
When we mourned and when we laughed
