**Translated Lyrics:**

I want my heart to whisper  
To release the restlessness  
About you  
Oh... oh... Beautiful...  
It's not that I want to disturb you  
But what does it mean to long for you  
Always,...  
Oh...  
Even if the sun rises in the north  
My heart is only for you...  

**Refrain:**  
There’s a heart that’s sweetest and full of love  
Of course, I will return it with all my soul  
No more  
No more will anything disturb us  
This is sincerity  
Truly, I love you  

Oh... oh... Beautiful...  
It's not that I want to disturb you  
But what does it mean to long for you  
Always,...  
Oh...  
Even if the sun rises in the north  
My heart is only for you...  

**(refrain)**  
I want to walk through the path of love  
A love that is eternal for you forever...  
Heyyyy..... heya ya ya heya ya ya heya...  

**(refrain)**
