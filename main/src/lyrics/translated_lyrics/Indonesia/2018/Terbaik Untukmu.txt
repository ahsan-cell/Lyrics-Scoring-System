**Translated Lyrics:**

We have grown further apart  
I once thought this was what you wanted  
To break free from my embrace  

* Oh now I realize  
This is my fault  
I don’t want to be late and regret it  

Chorus: Forgive me if I always  
Make you angry and hate me  
I do all of this  
Just to make you happy  

Maybe I just can’t understand  
How to show my intentions  
I only want to be the best for you  

I want you to stay here with me  
Don’t go  
Give me one chance  
To prove  
The truth of my love  

Repeat *  
Repeat chorus
