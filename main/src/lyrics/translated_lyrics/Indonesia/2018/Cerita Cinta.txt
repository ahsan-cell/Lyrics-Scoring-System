**Translated Lyrics:**

Yee iyee iyee ye ye ye ye...  
Heey iyee iyee iyee...

[Verse 1]  
It started with your eyes, the beauty of your smile  
Why should I feel restless?  
It began with a gaze, the warmth of your touch  
Why does it make me uneasy?

[Pre-Chorus]  
I never expected we were the same  
Holding the vibrations of love... love...  
Iyee...

[Chorus]  
Let love surge in our hearts  
Let love unite us, Ouwoo wo wo  
The first love story that I feel  
May our love story never end

[Verse 2]  
Now the longing I have is only for you  
Only for you  
If we truly must be together  
Why should there be doubt?

[Pre-Chorus]  
I never expected we were the same  
Holding the vibrations of love... love...  
Iyee...

[Chorus]  
Let love surge in our hearts  
Let love unite us, Ouwoo wo wo  
The first love story that I feel  
May our love story never end

[Bridge]  
The world seems to joke... (Ho oo)  
Watching our story... (Love aa aa Ouwoowo)

[Chorus]  
Let love (let love)  
Surge in our hearts  
Let love (let love)  
Unite us, Ouwoo wo wo  
The first love story that I feel  
May our love story never end

Let love...  
Surge in our hearts  
Let love...  
Unite us, Ouwoo wo wo  
The first love story that I feel  
May our love story never end  
Eey... (love story) yeiyeiyeiye... (our love story)  
Eey... (love story) yeiyeiyeiye... (our love story)  
Eey... may our love story never end
