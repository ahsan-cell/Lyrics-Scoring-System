**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You are so perfect  
In my eyes, you are so beautiful  
You make me  
Always worship you  

[Verse 2]  
In every step I take  
I will always think of you  
I can't imagine  
My life without your love  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Please don’t leave me  
I won’t be able to face it all  
Only with you can I endure  

[Chorus]  
You are my blood  
You are my heart  
You are my life  
Complete me  
Oh, my love, you are so  
Perfect  

[Post-Chorus]  
Perfect  
Perfect  

[Verse 2]  
You hold my hand  
When I am weak and fall  
You whisper words  
And erase all my regrets  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Please don’t leave me  
I won’t be able to face it all  
Only with you can I endure  

[Chorus]  
You are my blood  
You are my heart  
You are my life  
Complete me  
Oh, my love, you are so  

[Post-Chorus]  
Perfect  
Perfect  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Please don’t leave me  
I won’t be able to face it all  
Only with you can I endure  

[Chorus]  
You are my blood (my blood)  
You are my heart (my heart)  
You are my life  
Complete me  
Oh, my love, you are so  
You are my blood (my blood)  
You are my heart (my heart)  
You are my life  
Complete me  
Oh, my love, you are so  
My love, you are so  

[Post-Chorus]  
Perfect  
Perfect
