Hey, hey, how are you, my friend?  
Are you ready to step over your troubles  
And face tomorrow morning?  
Hey, hey, how are you, my friend?  
Are you ready to walk into the future and await the rainbow?

Make sure you give it a try  
Make your dreams come true, oh, come true  
We can all do it as long as we take a step  
Embrace the beautiful day, yeah

Let’s be grateful for all the blessings in this life  
We are happy, we are happy  
Together with the warm sun  
Enjoy and paint the memories
