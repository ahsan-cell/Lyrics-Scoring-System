**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I want love to be here forever  
Not just for a little while  
Greeting and then disappearing  
Rising and falling like a rainbow  
Whose beauty lasts only a moment  
So I can see it color my day  

[Chorus]  
Stay here with me  
Don’t come and then leave  
Don’t think of my heart  
As just a stopover for you  
For a fleeting love  

[Verse 2]  
Why can’t I be  
The love that will never be replaced?  
(I’m just becoming) a love that won’t ever happen  
So why are you still here  
Extending my hopes?  

[Chorus]  
Stay here with me  
Don’t come and then leave  
Don’t think of my heart  
As just a stopover for you  
For a fleeting love  

[Bridge]  
You’re like words that keep flowing  
In the vastness of the blue ocean waves  
But unfortunately, you didn’t choose me  
To be your harbor  

[Chorus]  
Stay here with me  
Don’t come and then leave  
Don’t think of my heart  
As just a stopover for you  

[Outro]  
If you don’t want to be here  
Don’t wander around anymore  
Let my heart  
Find true love  
Oh my love  
Oh fleeting love
