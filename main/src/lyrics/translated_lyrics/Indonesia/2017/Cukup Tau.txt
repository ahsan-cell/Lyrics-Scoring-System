**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s truly in vain  
I love him, but he doesn’t love me back  
The way he moves seems to say  
He doesn’t love me and doesn’t like me  
I start to think  
I’m heartbroken and I begin to feel  

[Chorus]  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to get close to you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling  

[Verse 2]  
The way he moves seems to say  
He doesn’t love me and doesn’t like me  
I start to think  
I’m heartbroken and I begin to feel  

[Chorus]  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to get close to you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to get close to you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to get close to you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore  
To be with you, my love  
Enough to know, plant it within  
No need for me to disturb you again  
I don’t want anymore, don’t want anymore, darling
