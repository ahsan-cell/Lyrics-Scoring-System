**Translated Lyrics:**

**Same Same**  
We both know  
There’s something going on  

[Verse 1]  
They say  
What’s good isn’t always the best  
I’ve tried to leave many times  
But I always turn back  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Maybe this means it’s a sign  
You’re the champion of my heart  

[Chorus]  
We both know  
That we both have doubts  
But there’s something that keeps making me believe in you again  
We both want  
You and I are searching for a way  
To unite once more  
Starting anew with the past  

[Verse 2]  
Sometimes I’m alone, sometimes I’m searching  
But I always return to you  
Maybe this means it’s a sign  
You’re the champion of my heart  

[Chorus]  
We both know  
That we both have doubts  
But there’s something that keeps making me believe in you again  
We both want  
You and I are searching for a way  
To unite once more  
Starting anew with the past  

[Bridge]  
Sometimes the future  
Is behind us  
Calling your name  
Chase it  
Sometimes the future  
Is behind us  
Calling your name  
Chase it  

[Chorus]  
We both know  
That we both have doubts  
But there’s something that keeps making me believe in you again  
We both want  
You and I are searching for a way  
To unite once more  
Starting anew with the past  

[Chorus]  
We both know  
That we both have doubts  
But there’s something that keeps making me believe in you again  
We both want  
You and I are searching for a way  
To unite once more  
Starting anew with the past  

[Outro]  
With the past  
With the past
