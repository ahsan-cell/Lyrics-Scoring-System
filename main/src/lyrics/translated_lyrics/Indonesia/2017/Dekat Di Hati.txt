**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The ringing of my phone  
Makes me smile in the morning light  
You tell me stories  
About how we met in dreams last night  
I don’t know why  
I feel your presence here with me  
Your laughter and jokes  
Comfort me when I’m lonely  

[Chorus]  
I’m here and you’re there  
Only meeting through our voices  
But I’ll always wait for the moment we’ll meet  
Though you’re far away right now  
We gaze at the same sky  
Far from sight but close at heart  

[Verse 2]  
The ringing of my phone  
Makes me smile in the morning light  
Your laughter and jokes  
Comfort me when I’m lonely  

[Chorus]  
I’m here and you’re there  
Only meeting through our voices  
But I’ll always wait for the moment we’ll meet  
Though you’re far away right now  
We gaze at the same sky  
Far from sight but close at heart  

[Instrumental Bridge]  

[Chorus]  
I’m here and you’re there  
Only meeting through our voices  
But I’ll always wait for the moment we’ll meet  
Though you’re far away right now  
We gaze at the same sky  
Far from sight but close at heart  
Distance and time won’t matter  
Because you will always be in my heart  
Like the heartbeat I carry wherever I go  
Though you’re far away right now  
We gaze at the same sky  
Far from sight but close at heart  

[Outro]  
Close at heart  
Close at heart
