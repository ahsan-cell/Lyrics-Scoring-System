**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Give me a chance to miss you  
Don’t keep coming around  
Also, give me some space to be free and alone  
Don’t always be there  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I need to know how much I need you  
Believe me, longing is good for us  

[Chorus]  
(In the morning seeing you) as noon approaches, you know  
(Where am I) this afternoon  
Never once has there been a cold night  
Until I forget what loneliness feels like  
No longer lonely, I can appreciate it  

[Verse 2]  
The good and bad of my changes, you won’t notice  
We are evolving  
If we want to know how deep our feelings run  
We need space  

[Chorus]  
(In the morning seeing you) as noon approaches, you know  
(Where am I) this afternoon  
Never once has there been a cold night  
Until I forget what loneliness feels like  
No longer lonely, I can appreciate it  

[Bridge]  
We still need our own space  
To continue to appreciate, oh, the feeling of loneliness  

[Chorus]  
(In the morning seeing you) as noon approaches, you know  
(Where am I) this afternoon  
Never once has there been a cold night  
Until I forget what loneliness feels like  
(In the morning seeing you) as noon approaches, you know  
(Where am I) this afternoon  
Never once has there been a cold night  
Until I forget what loneliness feels like  
No longer lonely, I can appreciate it  
No longer lonely, I can appreciate it
