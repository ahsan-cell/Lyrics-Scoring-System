**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When I feel it now  
There’s a space in my heart  
That you’ve touched, oh  
And when I realize  
It’s not always beautiful, love  
That exists, whoa oh oh whoa  

[Chorus]  
Maybe it’s me who must understand  
If I’m not the one you want to have  
Is it wrong of me  
If you’re the one in my heart?  
Oh  

[Verse 2]  
Is there a place for me in your heart?  
Could it be that you miss having me?  
Is there a little bit of me in your heart?  
When do I disturb your day?  
Maybe you don’t want me around  
Will I be a little in your heart?  

[Chorus]  
If it’s really me who must understand  
Why can’t I have your love?  
Is it wrong of me  
If you’re the one in my heart?  

[Bridge]  
You are the one in my heart  

[Chorus]  
If our love will never come to be  
I just want to understand  
Is there a place for me  
Oh, in your heart, woo ooh  
And when will you know  
You’re the one in my heart?  

[Outro]  
You are the one in my heart  
Am I in your heart?
