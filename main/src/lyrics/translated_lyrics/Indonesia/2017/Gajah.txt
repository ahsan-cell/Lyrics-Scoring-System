**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
At least I have seventy years  
I can't jump, but I can swim  
Happy to see the female herd  
Gathering together until death  

[Verse 2]  
Big and brave, I fight alone  
The only thing I avoid is a tiny ant  
This clever mind I've built with numbers  
Your face I will never forget  

[Pre-Chorus]  
When I was little, they laughed at me  
They called me an elephant  
(I got angry) I got angry  
Now I realize praise hides in mockery  
(They remember I got angry)  
Shake my hand, call me an elephant  

[Chorus]  
You are my friend, you pray for me  
With a clever mind, I must be strong  
If I fall, other elephants will help  
Your body, in a situation, willingly becomes my shield  

[Bridge]  
When we were small, we knew nothing  
It's natural to get angry too quickly  
When we were small, we knew nothing  
The worst can later become the best  
The worst can later become the best  

[Chorus]  
You are my friend, you pray for me  
With a clever mind, I must be strong  
If I fall, other elephants will help  
Your body, in a situation, willingly becomes my shield  
You are my friend, you pray for me  
With a clever mind, I must be strong  
If I fall, other elephants will help  
Your body, in a situation, willingly becomes my shield
