**Translated Lyrics:**

We are a pair of shoes  
Always together but never united  
We die as if we have no soul  
Moving only because of human feet  
I am the right shoe  
You are the left shoe  

[Bridge]  
I’m happy when invited to run fast  
But I’m afraid you’ll get tired  
I don’t mind getting caught in the rain  
But I’m scared you’ll feel cold  

[Hook]  
We realize we want to be together  
But there’s nothing we can do  
It feels complete when we’re both here  
It feels sad when we’re on different shelves  
Near you, the box feels like paradise  
But even touching, we are powerless  

[Bridge]  
I’m happy when invited to run fast  
But I’m afraid you’ll get tired  
I don’t mind getting caught in the rain  
But I’m scared you’ll feel cold  

[Verse 2]  
We realize we want to be together  
But there’s nothing we can do  
We realize we want to be together  
But there’s nothing we can do  
It feels complete when we’re both here  
It feels sad when we’re on different shelves  
Near you, the box feels like paradise  
But even touching, we are powerless  
Love indeed has many forms  
Maybe not all can unite
