**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
How happy my heart is when  
I sit alone with you  
Walking together with you  
Dance with me  

[Verse 2]  
But if today is the last day  
I will still be happy  
I will always be grateful  
That's just how it is  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But if you want to be alone  
Please tell me quickly  
So I won't have hope  
And make you sad  

[Chorus]  
When the time comes  
I want you to be my wife  
Walking with you in the sun and rain  
Running here and there, laughing  
But when the time to part has come  
Allow me to take care of you  
Together enjoying a hug at the end of time  
Please accompany me  

[Instrumental Bridge]  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But if you want to be alone  
Please tell me quickly  
So I won't have hope  
And make you sad  

[Chorus]  
When the time comes  
I want you to be my wife  
Walking with you in the sun and rain  
Running here and there, laughing  
But when the time to part has come  
Allow me to take care of you  
Together enjoying a hug at the end of time  
Please accompany me  

[Outro]  
Please be my friend  
Please be my wife
