**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Now I know that love doesn't rely on status  
Everyone knows when we are a couple  
But status doesn't guarantee love  

[Verse 2]  
Now I know that love doesn't depend on words  
Words can be spoken, but the heart doesn't align  
Words don't guarantee love, oh  

[Chorus]  
What for?  
What for is love without honesty?  
What for is love without actions?  
It means nothing  
What for?  
What for is love without proof?  
What for do we hold onto our status  
When love is no longer there?  

[Verse 3]  
Now I know that love doesn't depend on words  
Words can be spoken, but the heart doesn't align  
Words don't guarantee love, oh  

[Chorus]  
What for?  
What for is love without honesty?  
What for is love without actions?  
It means nothing  
What for?  
What for is love without proof?  
What for do we hold onto our status  
When love is no longer there?  

[Outro]  
What for?  
What for is love without proof?  
What for  
Do we hold on  
When love is no longer there?  
What for?
