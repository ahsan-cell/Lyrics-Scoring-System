**Translated Lyrics:**

I am here for you  
Once again for you  
I bring the longing  
That you ordered, complete  

I am here for you  
Once again for you  
Believe me, there's no need  
For you to worry  

[Chorus]  
I too feel your vibrations  
Loving me like I love you  
Truly, I am infatuated with you  

[Verse 2]  
Life is all about you  
Always just about you  
It seems you are my addiction  

You make me unable  
Always unable  
To hold back my feelings for you  

[Chorus]  
I too feel your vibrations  
Loving me like I love you  
Truly, I am infatuated with you  

[Bridge]  
To you  

[Chorus]  
I too feel your vibrations  
Loving me like I love you  
Truly, I am infatuated with you  

I too feel your vibrations  
Loving me like I love you  
Truly, I am infatuated with you  

(Truly, I am infatuated) truly infatuated with you  
(Truly, I am infatuated) infatuated with you  
(Truly, I am infatuated) with you  

[Outro:]  
My infatuation is with you
