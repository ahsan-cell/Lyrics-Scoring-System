**Translated Lyrics:**

We are teenagers, intoxicated by love  
Binding promises together for eternity  
Hearts intertwined, a pair of captivating eyes  
Elevating romance  
That always asks for more  
Stretching the evening, waiting for the arrival  
Of the one who holds my heart  
Willing to wait since the sun rose  
Eager to share  
Everything within my heart  
Brightening the soul and embracing at the end of the day  

**[Chorus]**  
The beauty of our love stories in our youth  
Under the allure of twilight, we indulge in sweetness  
There’s no time more beautiful than our teenage years  
As if the world belongs to just the two of us  

**[Verse 2]**  
My heart feels longing without a trace of sorrow  
The sweet melody of love resounds  
To the beloved  
Notes are created  
Holding the charm of the soul  
I give it to you, and you accept it  
We are two souls  
In the bliss of love  
Not caring about what will happen  
What I want right now  
Is for you to be here with me  

**[Outro]**  
The beauty of our love stories in our youth  
Under the allure of twilight, we indulge in sweetness  
There’s no time more beautiful than our teenage years (than our teenage years)  
As if the world  
As if the world  
As if the world belongs to just the two of us  
Our youth  
As if the world belongs to just the two of us
