**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Isyana]  
You and I  
Have become one  
In the bond of trust  
The seed of my love  
The seed of your love  
Grows ever more perfect  

[Pre-Chorus: Isyana]  
You make me  
Be myself  
I’m more certain about you, you, you  

[Chorus: Isyana]  
You are  
The most beautiful  
Who brings peace to my heart  
Loving you  
I will never fear  
Because you accept all my flaws  

[Verse 2: Rayi]  
Baby girl, you're so beautiful  
Our love is like a miracle  
It’s more than just physical attraction  
Even though we’re individuals  
We have a spiritual connection, affection  
And it’s always, you’re the one and only  
Baby, you can call me anytime  
You feel you want me  
And I’ll be there for you  
And I know you too  
And I love you 'til the world falls apart  

[Pre-Chorus: Isyana]  
You make me  
Be myself  
I’m more certain about you (What)  
You (Who)  
You (Yeah)  

[Chorus: Isyana]  
You are  
The most beautiful  
Who brings peace to my heart  
Being loved by you  
I will never fear  
Because you accept all my flaws  

[Verse 3: Rayi]  
Here we go, uh (I love you)  
We’ve been together through the worst times, girl  
(I love you)  
But I want you to know you still rock my world  
(Baby, I love you)  
I love you too, girl  
(I love you)  
And I love it when you smile, you’re so cute, girl  
(Baby, oh, I love you)  
Hey, but don’t be jealous  
While I’m hanging with my friends (I love you)  
When it’s just you and me, girl  
Feels like time is endless  
(Baby, I love you)  
And when the time is right  
I will have you by my side (I love)  
Saying this to your dad  

[Bridge: Rayi & Isyana]  
“Sir, can I marry your daughter?”  
Sing it for me, girl!  
Do you love me like I love you?  
(Of course, I do)  
Do you love me like I love  
You?  

[Chorus: Isyana]  
You are  
The most beautiful  
Who brings peace to my heart  
Being loved by you  
I will never fear  
Because you accept all my flaws  
You are (Bring it back, yeah)  
The most beautiful (Uh, one more time, girl)  
Who brings peace to my heart  
Being loved by you  
I will never fear (what?)  
Because you accept all my flaws  

[Outro: Rayi & Isyana]  
Ain't nobody love you like me  
Accepting all my flaws
