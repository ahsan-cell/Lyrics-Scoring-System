**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
If you can forget about her,  
Let me come in and arrange  
The space in your heart that has been closed for so long.  

[Verse 2]  
If you still hesitate to accept,  
Let your little heart speak,  
Because I believe the time will come.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You are a part of my life,  
You are a part of my life.  

[Chorus]  
I will never stop believing,  
Even if I have to wait a thousand years.  
Let things happen as they should,  
Even if I have to wait a thousand years.  

[Verse 3]  
If you still hesitate to accept,  
Let your little heart speak,  
Because I believe the time will come.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You are a part of my life,  
You are a part of my life.  

[Chorus]  
I will never stop believing,  
Even if I have to wait a thousand years.  
Let things happen as they should,  
Even if I have to wait a thousand years.  

[Bridge]  
No matter how long it takes (No matter how long it takes),  
I will remain faithful, waiting.  

[Chorus]  
I will never stop believing,  
Even if I have to wait...  
I will never stop believing,  
Even if I have to wait a thousand years.  
Let things happen as they should,  
Even if I have to wait a thousand years.
