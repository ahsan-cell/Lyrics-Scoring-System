**Translated Lyrics:**

One Word I've Been Waiting For  
Because I Can't...  
Read Your Eyes  
Hear Your Whispers  
Sing it, my love  
The Melody of Your Heart's Words  
Because I Can't Bear...  
To Interpret This Tremor  
Because I'm Doubting You  
Why is it Hard to Express Love?  
Even Though It Feels  
In Longing's Revenge  
In the Silent Night  
Love Feels Present...

Sing it, my love  
The Melody of Your Heart's Words  
Because I Can't Bear...  
To Interpret This Tremor  
Because I'm Doubting You  
Why is it Hard to Express Love?  
Even Though It Feels  
In Longing's Revenge  
In the Silent Night  
Love Feels Present...

Why is it Hard to Express Love?  
Even Though It Exists  
In the Drizzle of Rain  
In the Bright Moonlight  
Also in the Sorrowful Whispers  
Why is it Difficult to Admit Love?  
Even Though It Feels  
In Longing's Revenge  
In the Silent Night  
Love Feels Present...
