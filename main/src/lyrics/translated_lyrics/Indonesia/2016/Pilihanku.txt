**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
A million feelings that words can't express  
In countless ways, you always bring me happiness  
You are the reason and the answer to all my questions  
What I truly want is just for you to always be here  
Here for me  

[Chorus]  
Will you be my choice?  
The last one in my life  
Will you be the first?  
The one who’s always there when I open my eyes in the morning  

[Verse 2]  
Oh, let me have you, love you  
Take care of you, cherish you, give you love  
Giving you everything you desire, as long as I can, I will try  
To make all dreams and hopes come true  
Into reality  

[Chorus]  
Will you be my choice?  
The last one in my life  
Will you (will you) be the first (be the first)  
The one who’s always there when I open my eyes in the morning  

[Bridge]  
Be the last to be the first  
To be forever  

[Chorus]  
Will you (will you) be my choice (be my choice)  
The last one in my life  
Will you (will you) be (will you be) the first (the first)  
The one who’s always there in the morning (whoa)  
Will you (will you) be my choice (be my choice)  
The last one in my life (whoa)  
Will you (will you) be (will you be) the first (the first)  
The one who’s always there in the morning (whoa) when I open my eyes  

[Outro]  
Be the last to be the first  
To be forever  
Yeah yeah
