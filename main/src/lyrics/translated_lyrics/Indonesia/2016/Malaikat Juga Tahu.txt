**Translated Lyrics:**

Your happiness is my happiness, surely  
Sharing our fate forever  
Except when you fall in love  

This time I'm almost out of strength  
To prove to you that there is real love  
Faithfully present every day  
I can't bear to let you be alone  
Even though often you seem to enjoy your solitude  

Because you don't see sometimes the angels  
Without wings, not shining, not handsome  
But this love, feel free to compare  
The angels also know who will be the champion  

My presence won't vanish overnight for a dream lover  
But the chance for me may not be perfect  
Yet I'm ready to be tested  
I believe my love is the true one  

Because you don't see sometimes the angels  
Without wings, not shining, not handsome  
But this love, feel free to compare  
The angels also know who will be the champion  

You always ask me to stay by your side  
You always joke about changing my face  
Let me go because I can't stand being alone  

But you don't see sometimes the angels  
Without wings, not shining, not handsome  
But this love, feel free to compare  
The angels also know  

But you don't see sometimes the angels  
Without wings, not shining, not handsome  
But this love, feel free to compare  
The angels also know, the angels also know  
I am the one who will be the champion
