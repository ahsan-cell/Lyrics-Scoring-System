**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s not my intention  
To ignore you  
Right before my eyes  

But I can’t forget  
The moment you made  
Me feel humiliated  

[Chorus]  
My heart aches  
My heart is shattered  
To hate you  
Destroys my love  

[Verse 2]  
It’s not my intention  
To hide my smile  
When we meet  

But I can’t push away  
Your attitude  
I’m hurt inside  

[Chorus]  
My heart aches  
My heart is shattered  
To hate you  
Destroys my love  

[Interlude]  

[Verse 3]  
It’s not my intention  
To be unable to push away  
I’m hurt inside  

[Chorus]  
My heart aches  
My heart is shattered  
To hate you  
Destroys my love  

My heart aches  
My heart is shattered  
To hate you  
Destroys my love  

[Post-Chorus]  
Destroy, destroy, woo  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
My heart aches  
My heart is shattered  
To hate you  
Destroys my love
