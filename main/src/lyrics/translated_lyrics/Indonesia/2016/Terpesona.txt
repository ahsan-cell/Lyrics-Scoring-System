**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
When we met, there was a feeling in my heart  
You smiled sweetly, leaving me mesmerized  
I couldn't hold back the turmoil within me  
I want to say that I like you  

[Pre-Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Only you  
Only you  
Are the one I like  

[Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Captivated, it was love at first sight  
And I can't resist my longing for you  
Your smile always fills my dreams  
I want to hug you and kiss your forehead  

[Post-Chorus: Audy]  
Oh, how beautiful  

[Verse 2: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Now I feel (now I feel)  
The vibrations of love in my heart  
I want to be together  
Forever  

[Pre-Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Only you  
Only you  
Are the one I love  
Ooh, ooh, ooh  

[Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Captivated, it was love at first sight  
And I can't resist my longing for you  
Your smile always fills my dreams  
I want to hug you and kiss your forehead  

[Post-Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Oh, how beautiful  

[Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
Captivated, it was love at first sight  
And I can't resist my longing for you  
Your smile always fills my dreams  
I want to hug you and kiss your forehead (kiss your forehead)  

[Chorus: Glenn Fredly & Audy]  
(Captivated, it was love at first sight)  
And I can't resist my longing for you  
Your smile always fills my dreams  
I want to hug you and kiss your forehead  
Oh, how beautiful  

[Outro]  
(Captivated, it was love at first sight)  
(And I can't resist my longing for you)  
(Your smile always fills my dreams)  
(I want to hug you and kiss your forehead)
