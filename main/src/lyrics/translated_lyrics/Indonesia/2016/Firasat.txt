**Translated Lyrics:**

I see the clouds shaping your face  
The sigh of the wind whispers your name  
My body is frozen  
Last night  
The crescent moon curved your smile  
A sprinkle of stars like the glow of your aura  
I realize  
I must run quickly  
Hurry home  
Hurry back, don’t leave again  
My intuition wants you to come back soon  
Hurry back, don’t leave again...  
Finally  
Like a river longing for the ocean  
I know exactly where I will flow  
I hope there’s time  
My love  
I believe nature speaks too  
There’s meaning behind all the signs  
Is this feeling  
Longing or peace?  
I don’t care  
I keep running  
Hurry home  
Hurry back, don’t leave again  
My intuition wants you to come back soon  
Hurry back, don’t leave again  
And look, my dear  
The rain falls, soaking  
As if tears are falling  
Hurry home  
Hurry back, don’t leave again  
My intuition wants you to come back soon  
Hurry back, don’t leave again  
My intuition wants you to come back soon  
Come back...  
I also realize  
You are the intuition of my heart.
