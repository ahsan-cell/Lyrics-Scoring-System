**Translated Lyrics:**

From my nightmares  
All this time I've been trapped  
In your magnetic field  
I just realized  
You're like a parasite  
Always asking for this and that  
You demand from me as you please  

I've had enough, I'm starting to feel suffocated  
I need oxygen  
To breathe without you  

**Chorus:**  
Go to the ends of the earth  
Dehydrated in the Sahara Desert  
Lost in the Bermuda Triangle  

Go into outer space  
Hypothermic in the North Pole  
Lost in the Antarctic Ocean  
And don’t come back  

Parasite, parasite, parasite (parasite)  
You truly are a parasite  

At first, shy and coy  
Then you became a leech  
Always asking for this and that  
You demand from me as you please  

I've had enough  
I'm starting to get angry  
I'm like an atomic bomb  
Ready to explode because of you  

**Repeat Chorus**  

Parasite, parasite, parasite  
You truly are a parasite  
Always asking for money  
Always wanting to be treated  
Always needing a budget  
Always wanting a ride  
Always wanting a call  
Always wanting a text  
Always wanting to be bought  
You’re such a parasite, ah...
