**Translated Lyrics:**

Menahun, I wait for the words  
That encompass everything  

**[Dewi Lestari]**  
And now, I hope to be understood  
Even if just once in your embrace  

Nothing is hidden  

**[Aqi]**  
No need to deny  

**[Aqi & Dewi Lestari]**  
Your pain  
My pain  

No more excuses  
This is the truth  
It hurts indeed  
But this is the answer  

Let me go  
With all your soul  
Without me having to lie  
For you are the one I love  
And you don’t deserve to be tormented  

**[Dewi Lestari]**  
Realize that I too will be alone  
In the quiet of the early morning  

**[Aqi]**  
But what does it mean to be together?  

**[Aqi & Dewi Lestari]**  
Yet it’s all just an illusion  

Nothing is healed in this embrace  

**[Dewi Lestari]**  
But feel everything before I let you go forever  

**[Aqi & Dewi Lestari]**  
I won’t force it, just a little understanding  

**[Dewi Lestari]**  
That this is how it is  
A love that is no longer the same (no longer the same)  

**[Aqi & Dewi Lestari]**  
Let me go  
With all your soul  
Without me having to lie  
For you are the one I love  
And you don’t deserve to be tormented  

**[Aqi]**  
Let me go  

**[Dewi Lestari]**  
With all your heart and soul  

**[Aqi & Dewi Lestari]**  
And you don’t deserve to be tormented  

**[Dewi Lestari]**  
You are tormented  

**[Aqi]**  
And now (and now)  
I hope to be understood (understood)  
Even if just once in your embrace
