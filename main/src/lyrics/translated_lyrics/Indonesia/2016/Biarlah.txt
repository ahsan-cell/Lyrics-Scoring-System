**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I've been running  
Chasing the uncertain  
Chasing you  
Only you  
I sing my life  
I whisper my love  
Only for you  
Only for you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But you keep leaving  
But you keep running  
So let me stay here  

[Chorus]  
Let me willingly  
Release you  
Leaving me behind  
Grant me  
The strength  
To forget you  

[Verse 2]  
Time keeps rolling  
The pain still carves  
My path in life  
My path in life  
Give me your soul  
Give me your love  
Only for me  
Only for me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But you keep leaving  
But you keep running  
So let me stay here  

[Chorus]  
Let me willingly  
Release you  
Leaving me behind  
Grant me  
The strength  
To forget you  

[Bridge]  
You are far from me  
You keep drifting away  
From me  
You are far from me  
You keep drifting away  
From me  

[Chorus]  
Let me willingly  
Release you  
Leaving me behind  
Grant me  
The strength  
To forget you  

[Outro]  
Oh  
Oh no  
Oh no  
Oh no
