**Translated Lyrics:**

You who have left a mark in my heart  
Endless rain seems to be a sign  
That love is no longer here  
You have turned away  

**Chorus:**  
Let me keep this feeling, ohh  
Preserving all the love you’ve given  
You leave, but I won’t go  
You drift away, but I won’t stray  
Honestly, I still hope for you  

Is there still a light of your longing  
That used to always reflect your heart?  
I can’t erase you from my mind  
Even though I see now  
You are over there  

**(Repeat Chorus)**  

If in the end  
You don’t come back  
I will remain alone  
Guarding my heart  

**(Repeat Chorus 3x)**  

To be honest, I still hope for you
