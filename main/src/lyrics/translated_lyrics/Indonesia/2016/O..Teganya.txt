**Translated Lyrics:**

[Drop]

[Verse 1]  
Not just any fool, I’m a powerhouse  
This is a one-man army, and I’m back again  
Since I was born, I claim to be the best lyricist  
They don’t want beef, now they want publicity  
(Yeah)  
To hit the mark, you gotta be [? normal less]  
I’m not afraid of the boss, not afraid of the industrial tricks  
...  
I’m the legend  
The most dangerous 'Emcee Mwanamalundi  
So when the chiefdom comes, I’m ready  
No worries, the ugali I eat isn’t from a bell  
You gotta love it or leave it alone  
Their lines, I don’t know them, but mine flow  
They flow with their hearts, it resonates in their souls, oh  
I push my rhymes like a pimp pushes a hoe  
I’m Ngosha Ze Don, man  
Rock city, stand up!  
(Aye)  
I’m high like blue skies and the stars are aligned  
Still making music, my name keeps growing  
Not just in the East, Africa, the whole world knows me  
Fid Q is Farid, but not every Farid is Fid Q  
The wealth of poetry, I believe it’s only mine  
So, (So) If, (If) you’re trying to compete ('pete)  
You (You) better be critically good  
(Ooh, ooh)  
Listen to these flows over Marco-Chali’s beat  
They’re round like [?], they’re fierce  

[Chorus]  
[Drop]  
I don’t care  
That’s why I fight every day  
[Drop]  
I don’t care  
Woah, oh  

[Verse 2]  
Rapper [Gabachori] is biting, I don’t want that friendship  
(Mmm)  
Here, the strong ones carry metal, trying to be Tupac  
(Yeah, yeah)  
Today is tomorrow, you’re worried about yesterday  
You want to be the next Notorious, ‘cause BIG is dead  
(Woo...)  
I’m here to preach, teach, motivate, and entertain  
Maasai call me [Olegana]  
[?]  
My verses hit like Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan  
I’m making a mockery, respect me, see I’m lucky, man  
(Aight)  
Fid Q isn’t just a name, it’s a brand like Pepsi  
It’s more than just these bars, you hear them in every verse  
For [god's sake], people say I’m fit for endorsement  
Benevolent, man  
Rhymes sweeter than hot cake  
I need shades ‘cause the future is so bright  
I know the industry [?] Careers that don’t last  
Ngosha, I’m conscious, I’m here, I’m here like [?]  
Every day I’m focused on Hip-Hop, not “Hey baby”  
It’s alright, it’s okay  
Pick your nose, if you can do it all  
If music is a small bed, I’ll sleep in the middle  
These days’ hangouts don’t get lively without self-searching  

[Chorus]  
[Drop]  
I don’t care  
That’s why I fight every day  
[Drop]  
I don’t care  
[Drop]  
That’s why I fight every day  
Woo, woo  

[Phone conversation continues on between Fid Q and QJ]
