**Translated Lyrics:**

I've been waiting for you for so long  
I don't know until when  
We've been together for quite a while  
But is this all there is?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Who knows until when  
Who knows until when  

[Chorus]  
Today I will declare my love  
Declare my love  
I don't want to wait too long  
Too long  

[Verse 2]  
Do you realize, I am a woman  
I can't be the one to start  
Do you realize, you're keeping me hanging  
I don't want to wait  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Who knows until when  
Who knows until when  

[Chorus]  
Today I will declare my love  
Declare my love  
I don't want to wait too long  
Too long  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Chorus]  
Today I will declare my love  
Declare my love  
I don't want to wait too long  
Too long  

Today I will declare my love  
Declare my love  
I don't want to wait too long  
Too long
