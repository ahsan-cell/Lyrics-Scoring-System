**Translated Lyrics:**

Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  

**[Verse 1]**  
I start each day by wishing for you, hoping you’re always healthy and happy there  
Before you forget me even more  
Before you leave me behind  
I never hoped you would miss my presence  
This sad existence of mine  
I just want that whenever you see me, wherever you are, your heart will say this  
"This man has fallen for you"  
"This man will always adore you"  
"A-ha, yeah, a-ha, yeah"  
Just like the rappers try to cheer me up  

**[Refrain]**  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’m the one who always places flowers and writes love notes on your desk  
I’m the one who will always watch over you  
Enjoying your beauty from my dark side  
And let me be your admirer, don’t ever mind  
My feelings  
Calm down, calm down my beloved  
I wouldn’t dare to touch you  

**[Chorus]**  
Maybe you’ll never know  
How easy it is for you to be admired  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
Maybe you’ll never realize  
How easy it is for you to be loved  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  

**[Instrumental Break]**  

**[Bridge]**  
I’m the one who will always adore you  
I’m the one who will always keep an eye on you  
I’m the one who will always adore you  
I’m the one who will always keep an eye on you  

**[Chorus]**  
Maybe you’ll never know (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
How easy it is for you to be admired (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
Maybe you’ll never realize (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
How easy it is for you to be loved (Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  
(Na-na-na, na-na-na-na)  

**[Verse 3]**  
Because only with my deep longing for you  
I sustain my life  
So only with the traces of your heart  
Does my life have meaning as I navigate through it  
Forever I can only adore you  
Forever I can only miss you  

**[Outro]**  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh
