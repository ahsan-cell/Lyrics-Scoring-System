**Translated Lyrics:**

The cold wind greets me,  
Trying to feel,  
The gentle presence of you.  

My God, I ask about love,  
Where is its direction and purpose?  
If we are truly to part,  
Why must death be the one to separate us?  

I praise you, even from afar,  
It echoes sweetly into the sky.  
The cries of my heart call out to you,  
Can you hear the soul of my life?  

My spirit and body crumble,  
Shattered into pieces.  
My hands and feet are gone,  
No longer standing on this earth.  

I praise you, even from afar,  
It echoes sweetly into the sky.  
The cries of my heart call out to you,  
Can you hear the soul of my life?  

You, strip away my being always,  
Through the beauty of your embrace.  
Holding my heart, which is bound,  
And now, you leave me.  

I praise you, even from afar,  
It echoes sweetly into the sky.  
The cries of my heart call out to you,  
Can you hear the soul of my life?  

I praise you, even from afar,  
It echoes sweetly into the sky.  
The cries of my heart call out to you,  
Can you hear the soul of my life?
