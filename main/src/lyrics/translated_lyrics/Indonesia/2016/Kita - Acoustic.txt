**Translated Lyrics:**

In the moments we laugh, cry, and reflect on love,  
I try to erase the feelings,  
Feelings where you drift far from my soul and my dreams.  
Let it be, let it be, our days,  
Bound together through your sweet words.

**Chorus:**  
And you whisper words of love,  
You’ve sprinkled feelings of affection,  
Let’s ensure we’re in harmony,  
Even if tied by feelings of shame.  
For a moment, you seem wilted,  
If you long for the laughter that colors our path.  
Let’s sip and savor my dreams and yours,  
Bound together through the promise of your words.
