**Translated Lyrics:**

When I realize you are no longer here

How long can I endure this?
Yet I live through all the stories of my life

Every memory etched will never be replaced

But they remain beautiful and stick in my heart
Will all the feelings that have been created come to an end
In my mind and in my hopes?

I drown in solitude as I realize
You are no longer here now.
