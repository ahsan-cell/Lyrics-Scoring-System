**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I can't believe  
You're here with me  
Keeping me company  
When she has gone  
Truly happy  
You're here with me  
Wiping away all  
The pain that I feel  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Could you feel  
Everything I've surrendered?  
Remember, my love  

[Chorus]  
I like him  
Maybe I love him  
But is it possible  
For you to be mine?  
You once were, were his  
But is it wrong of me  
To keep this feeling inside?  

[Interlude]  
Na, na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na, na, na  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Could you feel  
Everything I've surrendered?  
Remember, my love  

[Chorus]  
I like him  
Maybe I love him  
But is it possible  
For you to be mine?  
You once were, were his  
But is it wrong of me  
To keep this feeling inside?  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Chorus]  
I like him  
Maybe I love him  
But is it possible  
For you to be mine?  
You once were, were his  
But is it wrong of me  
To keep this feeling inside?
