**Translated Lyrics:**

I can't believe you've become this way  
Once you were an angel in my heart  
How could you have turned out like this?  

Time and again, you said it yourself  
Now I’ve grown to hate you  
My love has gone away  

Just go, just leave  
No need to come back  
It’s pointless now, only bringing pain  
I’ve had enough of knowing you  
I’ve felt enough hurt as it is  

A promise I’ll remember until I die  
You were faithful until I returned  

Time and again, you said it yourself  
Now I’ve grown to hate you  
My love has gone away  

Just go, just leave  
No need to come back  
It’s pointless now, only bringing pain  
Just throw away the love from yesterday  
I can no longer trust your feelings  
I’ve had enough of knowing you  
I’ve felt enough hurt as it is  

Just go, just leave  
No need to come back  
It’s pointless now, only bringing pain  
Just throw away the love from yesterday  
Oh... I can’t trust you anymore  
Just leave me be  
It will all be in vain  
I’ve had enough of knowing you  
I’ve felt enough hurt as it is
