**Translated Lyrics:**

God, help me  
I can't hold back the feelings in my chest  
I want to have him  
But he belongs to someone else  
God, help me  
It turns out he’s my friend’s lover  
I don’t know what to say  
My heart is confused and uncertain  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I never meant to hurt your heart  
But I’m also a woman  
Who wants to feel love  

**[Chorus]**  
Never, never want you  
Really, really love you  
Forgive me for disappointing you  
Really, really love you  
Never, never leave you  
I’ll soon forget about him  

**[Verse 2]**  
God, help me  
I can't hold back the feelings in my chest  
I want to have him  
But he belongs to someone else  
God, help me (God, help me)  
It turns out he’s my friend’s lover  
I don’t know what to say  
My heart is confused and uncertain  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I never meant to hurt your heart  
But I’m also a woman  
Who wants to feel love  

**[Chorus]**  
Never, never want you  
Really, really love you (Really, really want you)  
Forgive me for disappointing you  
Really, really love you  
Never, never leave you  
I’ll soon forget about him  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I never meant to hurt your heart  
But I’m also a woman  
Who wants to feel  
Wants to feel loved, hoo  

**[Chorus]**  
Never, never want you  
Really, really love you (Really, really want you)  
Forgive me for disappointing you (Sorry)  
Really, really love you  
Never gonna leave you
