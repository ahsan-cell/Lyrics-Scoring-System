**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
This story is no longer the same  
Though your heart is always here  
Understand that I haven’t changed  
Look at me from a different side  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Lean on me  
Feel my heart  
Lean on me  

[Chorus]  
And I am not myself  
Without you to hold me  
You complete me  
You perfect me  

[Verse 2]  
The time we’ve been through  
Makes you mean so much more  
Melt the hardness of my heart  
You are the one I’ve been searching for  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Lean on me  
Feel my heart  
Lean on me  

[Chorus]  
And I am not myself  
Without you to hold me  
You complete me  
You perfect me  
And I am not myself  
Without you by my side  
You calm me down  
You bring me relief  

[Instrumental]  

[Chorus]  
And I am not myself  
Without you to hold me  
You complete me  
You perfect me  
And I am not myself  
Without you by my side  
You calm me down  
You bring me relief
