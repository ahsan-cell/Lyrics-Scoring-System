**Translated Lyrics:**

I know you’re bored  
I know you’re weary  
I know you can’t take it anymore  

It’s all my fault  
It’s all because of me  
I know you can’t take it anymore  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Don’t be sad, don’t be sad  
I will surely be faithful  

[Chorus]  
I’m afraid you’ll leave  
You’ll disappear, you’ll hurt  
I want you here  
By my side forever  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Don’t be afraid, don’t be sad  
I will surely be faithful  

[Chorus]  
I’m afraid you’ll leave  
You’ll disappear, you’ll hurt  
I want you here  
By my side forever  

I’m afraid (Don’t be afraid) you’ll leave (You won’t leave)  
You’ll disappear, you’ll hurt  
I want (I also) you here (With you)  
By my side forever  

I’m afraid (Don’t be afraid) you’ll leave (You won’t leave)  
You’ll disappear, you’ll hurt  
I want (I also) you here (With you)  
By my side (By your side) forever
