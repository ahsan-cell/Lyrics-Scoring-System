**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I can't bear  
The pain in my heart  
Your intention, you're a rival  

[Verse 2]  
I've tried countless ways  
But what can I do, I'm powerless  
You desire it  

[Chorus]  
I can't let my fingers accept two rings  
From your heart, from your love  
And I can't share my feelings of love  
With her, from your love  

[Verse 3]  
I've tried countless ways  
But what can I do, I'm powerless  
You desire it  

[Chorus]  
I can't let my fingers accept two rings  
From your heart, from your love  
And I can't share my feelings of love  
With her, from your love  

[Interlude]  
(I can't let my fingers accept two rings)  
(From your heart, from your love)  
Oh  

[Chorus]  
And I can't share my feelings of love  
With her, from your love  
(And I can't share my feelings of love)  
With her, from your love  

[Outro]  
I can't  
Bear the pain
