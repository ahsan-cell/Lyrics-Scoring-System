**Translated Lyrics:**

I have to admit  
Everything has changed  
Tired of going through  
Everything feels wrong  

What’s more, my fault  
What’s more, your fault  
I don’t understand  
What’s more, my fault  
What’s more, your fault  
What’s more  

Enough  
Forget all the stories  
Between us  
I don’t want, I don’t want, I don’t want  
You to be hurt  
Because of love  

Tired of going through  
Everything feels wrong  

What’s more, my fault  
What’s more, your fault  
I don’t understand  
What’s more, my fault  
What’s more, your fault  
What’s more  

Enough  
Forget all the stories  
Between us  
I don’t want, I don’t want, I don’t want  
You to be hurt  
Because of love  

Not  
Because that feeling has faded  
Forgive me  
I just don’t want  
I don’t want, I don’t want  
To be hurt  
Because of love  

Ohh  
It’s not that I don’t hope  
To return to you  
But understand  
I don’t want  
I don’t want to be hurt  

Enough  
Forget all the stories  
Between us  
I don’t want, I don’t want, I don’t want  
You to be hurt  
Because of love  
Not  
Because that feeling has faded  
Forgive me  
I just don’t want  
I don’t want, I don’t want  
To be hurt  
Because of love
