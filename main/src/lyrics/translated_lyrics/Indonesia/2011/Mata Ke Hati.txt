**Translated Lyrics:**

I've never felt love  
So powerful before  
Until I met you  
My world was gray  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And then you came, bringing love  
That I've long awaited  

[Chorus]  
Oh my love, you make love  
Fall from my eyes and into my heart  
Your laughter makes me smile again  
Oh my love, you make the world  
Beautiful to live in  
I believe your heart means the most  

[Verse 2]  
Only you are the one  
Who resides in my heart  
If only we could be  
Together forever  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And then you came, bringing love  
That I've long awaited  

[Chorus]  
Oh my love, you make love  
Fall from my eyes and into my heart  
Your laughter makes me smile again  
Oh my love, you make the world  
Beautiful to live in  
I believe your heart means the most  

[Bridge]  
Falling from my eyes  
And into my heart  
You make the world  
Beautiful to live in  
I believe in my heart  

[Chorus]  
Oh my love, you make love  
Fall from my eyes and into my heart  
Your laughter makes me smile again  
Oh my love, you make the world  
Beautiful to live in  
I believe your heart means the most  
Oh my love, you make love  
Fall from my eyes and into my heart  
Your laughter makes me smile again  
Oh my love, you make the world  
Beautiful to live in  
I believe your heart means the most
