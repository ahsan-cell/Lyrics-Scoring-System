**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You, make me blush  
Make me shy when I'm with you  
When I greet you  

[Verse 2]  
I, why do I get goosebumps?  
Why do I feel nervous when I'm with you?  
When you smile at me  

[Chorus]  
Maybe, this is what it feels like, the feeling of liking someone  
From the very first time, I asked  
"What’s your Facebook?" "What’s your number?"  
Maybe, this is what it feels like, love at first sight  
Your sweet smile makes my heart race endlessly  

[Verse 3]  
Later, I’ll follow your Twitter  
I’ll wait for your retweet, so I’ll know  
Do you like me too?  

[Chorus]  
Maybe, this is what it feels like, the feeling of liking someone  
From the very first time, I asked  
"What’s your Facebook?" "What’s your number?"  
Maybe, this is what it feels like, love at first sight  
Your sweet smile makes my heart race endlessly  

[Bridge]  
Yeah, only you, only you can make me  
Sleep uncertainly thinking of you, my beloved  
Oh, you’re so beautiful!  
Oh, God, I just want her to know  
You’re cute, you’re so cute  

[Chorus]  
Maybe, this is what it feels like, the feeling of liking someone  
From the very first time, I asked  
"What’s your Facebook?" "What’s your number?"  
"What’s your number?"  
Maybe, this is what it feels like, love at first sight  
Your sweet smile makes my heart race endlessly  
Maybe, this is what it feels like (This is what it feels like, wow), the feeling of liking someone  
From the very first time (From the very first time), I asked  
(I saw your smile, your glance, seeing how beautiful you are)  
"What’s your Facebook?" "What’s your number?"  
Maybe this is what it feels like, love at first sight  
(Oh, could this be what I feel?)  
Your sweet smile makes me (Your smile makes me)  
Race endlessly  

[Outro]  
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you  
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
