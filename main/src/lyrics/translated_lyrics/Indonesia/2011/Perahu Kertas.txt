**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
My paper boat will sail  
Carrying a love letter for you  
Words that are a little crazy  
But this is how it is  
The paper boat reminds me  
How amazing this life is  
Searching for a place to anchor my heart  
You are my only friend  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Revive the dreams (Loves)  
The aspirations (Loves)  
That I've long kept to myself  
Together, I can believe  

[Chorus]  
I am happy  
You have been born into this world  
And you exist  
Among billions of people  
And with my radar,  
I can find you  

[Bridge]  
No one can stand in the way  
Of my feelings  
My love for you  

[Chorus]  
I am happy  
You have been born into this world  
And you exist  
Among billions of people  
And with my radar,  
I can find you  
Oh, happiness  
You have been born into this world  
And you exist  
Among billions of people  
And with my radar,  
I can find you
