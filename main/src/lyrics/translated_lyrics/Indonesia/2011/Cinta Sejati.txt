**Translated Lyrics:**

Revisiting memories when love meets love  
The voice of night and day seems to sing a tune  
I can hear your longing calling my name  

When I am no longer by your side, Ramzie  
I will wait for you in eternity  

I have never left, always in your heart  
You are never far, always within my heart  
My soul cries out, affirming my love for you  
Thankful to the divine love that unites us  

When I am no longer by your side  
I will wait for you in eternity  

Love, Ain and Ramzie, we paint a history  
Unfolding a story of Ramzie filled with joy  
So that anyone, be they human or God  
I will wait for you in eternity  

Ain waits for Ramzie, but Ramzie does not come, she is sad  
They are friends in romance  
May Allah bless their lives  

The valley colored  
Curves embracing us  
Two souls merging into one  
In the purity of our love  

Our love paints a history  
Unfolding a story full of joy  
So that anyone, be they human or God  
Surely knows our true love
