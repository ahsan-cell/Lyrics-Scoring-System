**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
So many things  
That I've experienced, that I've encountered  
When I'm with you  
I feel joy, I feel sadness  

[Pre-Chorus]  
These tears  
Awaken me  
You will never  
Be mine  

[Pre-Chorus]  
These tears  
Awaken me  
You will never  
Become mine  

[Chorus]  
I never understood I could be this crazy  
I live for you, I die without you  
I never realized I could be this foolish  
I live for you, I die without you  

[Instrumental]  

[Pre-Chorus]  
These tears  
Awaken me  
You will never  
Become mine  

[Chorus]  
I never understood I could be this crazy  
I live for you, I die without you  
I never realized I could be this foolish  
I live for you, I die without you
