**Translated Lyrics:**

When I drown in sorrow  
Time hesitates to pass by  
I promise to close the door of my heart  
Not knowing for whom it may be  

The more I look at the past  
The more my heart feels uncertain  
But one light brightens my soul  
When I see your smile  

[Chorus]  
And you come to change everything  
Into something more beautiful  
You lift my love to the skies  
Making me feel perfect  
And make me whole to live this life  
Together with you forever  
You are the best for me  

[Verse 2]  
Now I want to stop time  
When you are near me  
The flower of love blooms in my soul  
I will pick one for you  

[Chorus]  
And you come to change everything  
Into something more beautiful  
You lift my love to the skies  
Making me feel perfect  
And make me whole to live this life  
Together with you forever  
You are the best for me  
You are the best for me  

[Bridge]  
I entrust my whole heart to you  
My love, one promise, you are the last for me  

[Chorus]  
And you come to change everything  
Into something more beautiful  
You lift my love to the skies  
Making me feel perfect  
And make me whole to live this life  
Together with you forever  
You are the best for me
