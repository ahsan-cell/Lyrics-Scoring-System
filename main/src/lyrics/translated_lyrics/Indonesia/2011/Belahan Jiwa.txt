**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1 - Rob C]

Don’t have any illusions, I don’t show mercy  
My flow’s so strong, like I’ve got 10 GB RAM  
Your life is just spam, this line hits like a bam  
My fam stays happy, we stick together, man  
The beat’s so beautiful, every word is a gem  
My pen game’s strong, other rappers call me the best  
On Facebook, they message, asking for my number next  
You’re just a snitch, don’t betray anyone, friend  
You know KKG, the Punjabi Wu-Tang Clan  
Since 9/11, we’ve had a bigger plan  
Best rappers in the game, we’re the ones they stand  
You can’t be like me, buddy, you just can’t

[Verse 2 - Veer Karan]

My life’s moving fast, my friend  
I’m living like a king, unlike your past, my friend  
I’ve got cash in hand, living life to the fullest  
I’m above any school, my class is the coolest  
When I put money in my pocket,  
Everyone asks, “Bro, how are you doing?”  
Now they say your songs are really great  
Make us too, take as much money as you want  
What do you know about him?  
He doesn’t hide, he’s always doing his thing  
How many people are out there talking about me?  
I count my notes like counting stars, you see

[Hook - Sikander Kahlon (Sady Immortal)]

I don’t care about you, (I don’t care, my friend)  
If you don’t care about me, (If you don’t care about me)  
Look ahead and behind, (Oh, just look right)  
No one cares about you, nah nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 3 - Sikander Kahlon]

My thoughts are open, your mind is still a virgin  
With tattoos on my neck, it’s heavy, my burden  
Writing new verses, my friend, I do it every day  
First Punjabi rapper wearing a turban, hey  
I’m urban, but I’m also rural  
I’m going hard in rap, do you even know?  
If I get respect, it’ll come back  
If I blow up, I’ll rise, no doubt  
I break through barriers, it’s just my habit  
Your rap is a drama, nothing’s really achieved  
Those who mess with me in rap, they’ll regret  
Ego doesn’t bother me, my verse hits hard, Kahlon

[Verse 4 - Sady Immortal]

When I needed you, where were you all?  
Now I don’t need anyone, I walk tall  
I’m alone, but I’m strong for those who are weak  
I’m a fear for the scared, a gift for the meek  
For the selfish, I’m a need, for you, I’m death  
Who am I? The one you wish to be, that’s my breath  
What do I care about others? I’ll live my way  
I get drenched when it rains, come what may  
I rise above troubles, through tough times, I stay  
Forget the past, because I’m happy today  
I tell God, “Thank you,” for this life I lead  
Don’t show off money, don’t act like you’re in need  
Forget all the talk, this city knows my name,  
You know Mohali, it’s not just a game  
What’s the rumor about you? What’s the fuss?  
Do I care about you? No, I don’t, that’s a must  
You can say what you want, but I’ll stay true  
I’ll call you back, don’t think it’s too late for you
