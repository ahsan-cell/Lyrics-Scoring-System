**Translated Lyrics:**

When we meet and you greet me,  
Your beautiful face warms the atmosphere.  
I can't believe it, my sweet dream has come true.  
When I'm alone going through the day,  
Your shadow always comes my way,  
And I understand what this heart desires.

[Pre-Chorus]  
But suddenly, you belong to someone else,  
This heart is wounded,  
I’m truly disappointed,  
I want to say...

[Chorus]  
Forgive me if I fall in love,  
I'm sorry if I have feelings for you.  
When you belong to someone else,  
Should I just bury these feelings?  
Or should I just carry on,  
Until you leave them and we are together?

[Pre-Chorus]  
But suddenly, you belong to someone else,  
This heart is wounded (Wounded),  
I’m truly disappointed (I’m truly disappointed),  
I want to say...

[Chorus]  
Forgive me if I fall in love,  
I'm sorry if I have feelings for you.  
When you belong to someone else,  
Should I just bury these feelings?  
Or should I just carry on,  
Until you leave them and we are together?

[Bridge]  
Will there be a chance  
For me to express  
The feelings that have been here all along?

[Chorus]  
Forgive me if I fall in love (Sorry if you fall in love),  
I'm sorry if I have feelings for you (Sorry if you like me).  
When you belong to someone else,  
Should I just bury these feelings?  
Or should I just carry on,  
Until you leave them and we are together?  
Forgive me if I fall in love,  
I'm sorry if I have feelings for you.  
When you belong to someone else,  
Should I just bury these feelings?  
Or should I just carry on,  
Until you leave them and we are together?
