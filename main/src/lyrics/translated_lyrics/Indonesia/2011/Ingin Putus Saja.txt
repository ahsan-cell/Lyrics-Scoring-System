**Translated Lyrics:**

And finally, now my heart has no feelings left at all  
Rather than going crazy for too long, ha ha ha, going crazy  
It’s better to part ways quickly  

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving up  
But I just want to break up because there’s no love  
I can’t be with you anymore  

It’s not just once, we often break up for a day and then come back  
You promised many times to change, but it only gets worse, making me angry  
Rather than going crazy for too long, going crazy  
It’s better to part ways quickly  

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving up  
But I just want to break up because there’s no love  
I can’t be with you anymore  

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving up  
But I just want to break up because there’s no love  
I can’t be with you anymore  

Not giving up, just wanting to break up  
Just wanting to break up  

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving up  
But I just want to break up because there’s no love  
I can’t be with you anymore
