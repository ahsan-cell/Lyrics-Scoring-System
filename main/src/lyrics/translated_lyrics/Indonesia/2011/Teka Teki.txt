**Translated Lyrics:**

Sometimes you pull away, sometimes you make me blush  
The sweetness of your words  
Leaves me feeling uncertain  
I don’t know what to do  

Truly, you make me wonder  
With your riddles and enigmas  
Could I possibly find the answer  
To your riddles and enigmas?  

Are you aware of what I feel?  
Should I reveal my true feelings?  
The sweetness of your words  
Leaves me feeling uncertain  
I don’t know how to proceed  

Truly, you make me wonder  
With your riddles and enigmas  
Could I possibly find the answer  
To your riddles and enigmas?  

Truly, you make me wonder  
With your riddles and enigmas  
Could I possibly find the answer  
To your riddles and enigmas?  

Sometimes I feel almost unable  
To face you and all your questions  

Truly, you make me wonder  
With your riddles, your riddles, your enigmas  
Could I possibly find the answer  
To your riddles and enigmas?  

Truly, you make me wonder  
With your riddles and enigmas  
Could I possibly find the answer  
To your riddles and enigmas?  

You make me wonder  
With all your riddles and enigmas  
Could I possibly find the answer  
To your riddles and enigmas?
