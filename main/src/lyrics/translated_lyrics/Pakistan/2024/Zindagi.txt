**Translated Lyrics:**

In dreams,  
We all,  
In our eyes,  
In our gazes,  
If you ever...

Just lift your hands a little,  
Ask God for a prayer,  
To share all the joys,  
And erase all the sorrows.

In colors,  
In dreams,  
We all,  
In our eyes,  
In our gazes,  
If you ever...

Life, just sway a little,  
Look around you,  
Share all the joys,  
And forget all the sorrows.

May we remain in colors,  
May we remain in dreams,  
May we remain in colors,  
May we remain in dreams,  
May we remain in colors,  
May we remain in dreams,  
May we remain in colors,  
May we remain in dreams.
