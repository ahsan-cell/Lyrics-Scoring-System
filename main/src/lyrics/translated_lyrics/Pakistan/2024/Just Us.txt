**Translated Lyrics:**

Your words, those words of yours  
They won't leave my heart, won't leave my heart  
Nights without you, nights  
Why should I let them go, let them go?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
If I don't agree, then I don't know  
Together we've lost, my love  

**[Chorus]**  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  

**[Verse 2]**  
There are some wishes in my heart  
That I've carried since then  
Even dying, I don't die a hundred times  
Some things remain in my mind  
Were my promises not enough?  
I've been sitting here, now smile and say it  
Don't speak, oh beloved, don't speak  
Don't hold yourself back like this, don't hold back  
Don't break me like this, don't break me  
My dear  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
If I don't agree, then I don't know  
Together we've lost, my love  

**[Chorus]**  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry  
So then, my dear, my heart's desire  
Don't just leave me, don't make my heart cry
