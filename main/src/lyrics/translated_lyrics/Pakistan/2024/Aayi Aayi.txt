**Translated Lyrics:**

What to do, what not to do,  
Why don’t you tell me?  
The strength of the henna doesn’t fade away.  

What is it that I have, what do I lack?  
Why do you tell me?  
When you don’t play for me, why do you speak?  

[Verse 1]  
What should I say about your state and my questions?  
When we travel together, what else can I say?  
Dreams are being wrapped,  
Water is being swallowed,  
Seeing you return like this makes me feel all of creation.  

[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Look, it’s a victory!  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Look, it’s a victory!  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Victory, oh victory, oh victory!  

[Bridge]  
Yeah!  
Mangi on the mic!  

[Verse 2]  
My beloved, waiting for me,  
In hand, there’s a lamp, all in trust.  
Just like he won in one night,  
The whole world is trapped in one person.  

Come on, show your talent,  
What are you waiting for? The whole caravan is ready.  
Though pain has come, let it out from within,  
No one dares, bring your dance!  

[Verse 3]  
I’ll talk about the truth,  
Today’s success is just one blow.  
What’s the use of such pride, brother?  
Ask me, I’ll speak about the truth.  

Rise with whatever song you want to sing,  
You’re here, but there’s no account to settle.  
This world is built on dreams, think and shape yourself,  
Life will keep moving, never stopping.  

[Verse 4]  
What will you say when the eyes close?  
In dreams, you sit, looking at the sky.  
When the beat drops, will you sway?  
On the dry ground, will you dance?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Dreams are being wrapped,  
Water is being swallowed,  
Seeing you return like this makes me feel all of creation.  

[Chorus]  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
How do you sit on the bed?  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Dreams fulfilled, I’m not dependent on cash.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Lights on, I’m standing on stage.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh oh oh oh.  

[Verse 5]  
Sister, the sun has risen,  
Darkness has gone away.  
My beloved has arrived,  
Purity has walked away.  

Sister, the sun has risen,  
Darkness has gone away.  
My beloved has arrived,  
Purity has walked away.  

[Verse 6]  
These dreams have shown this dream,  
They are becoming real in the desert.  
He is not alone in the caravan,  
Everyone is gathered, all are together.  
The philosophy of life is given,  
Even if you stand, you won’t be loved.  
Seeing you return like this makes me feel all of creation.  

[Instrumental-break]  

[Chorus]  
Look, it’s a victory!  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Look, it’s a victory!  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  

Look, it’s a victory!  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh,  
Look, it’s a victory!  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh.  

[Outro]  
Oh oh oh.
