**Translated Lyrics:**

If you remain silent, you're deemed unfaithful,  
But if you speak up, you're labeled a traitor.  
Congratulations to you for this patience,  
The sin of love is what I've earned.  

O preacher, keep your advice to yourself,  
My beloved is no one's enemy.  
Come to the court of love and test yourself,  
See if you can understand the patient of love.  

The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  
The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  

The naive heart, oh naive heart, is yearning,  
To sway and dance away.  
The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  

Why is the world in such a hurry?  
Let me share some sorrows,  
The mischief in those eyes has captivated me,  
They are the ones speaking of departure today.  

Who spread such rumors of disgrace?  
They turned it into a spectacle just to mock.  
The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  

The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  
The naive heart, oh naive heart, is yearning,  
To sway and dance away.  

The prayers of love were recited, yet you delayed it,  
In the test of love, we remained faithful.  
For those for whom we gave our every moment and life,  
They remained in the same state when buried, still performing ablutions.  

In haste, my love, to suppress us,  
They carried dreams in their fists, while we remained patient.  
The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  

The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  
The naive heart, oh naive heart, is yearning,  
To sway and dance away.  

The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.  
The naive heart is yearning once again,  
To sway and dance away.
