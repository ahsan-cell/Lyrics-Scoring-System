**Translated Lyrics:**

Everything feels so foreign now  
It seems like my heart is nowhere  
You've forgotten us, just like that  
As if we never existed  

My heart, I don't know what hopes it holds  
Only darkness remains  
Every dawn begins with thoughts of you  
Do you smile without me? Or laugh out loud, my love?  
Do you find joy without me, shedding tears, my love?  
Do you, without me?  
Do you adorn yourself, shyly, my love?  
Do you, without me?  
Do you, without me?  

[Verse 2]  
You said my face should not be seen  
Tell them that wasn’t true  
How can I reach out, gripped by fear?  
The right I had is gone  
Come, let’s walk these paths again  
Let’s promise not to fight over these things  
If there are no grievances, then it’s all good  
Just trust me, believe in my intentions  
Do you smile without me? Or laugh out loud, my love?  
Do you, without me?  
Do you find joy, shedding tears, my love?  
Do you, without me?  
Do you adorn yourself, shyly, my love?  
Do you, without me?  
Do you, without me?  

[Verse 3]  
Come, let’s walk these paths again  
(Do you, without me?)  
Let’s promise not to fight over these things  
(Do you, without me?)  
If there are no grievances, then it’s all good  
(Do you, without me?)  
Just trust me, believe in my intentions  
(Do you, without me?)  

[Outro]  
Come, let’s go  
(Do you, without me?)  
Let’s promise  
(Do you, without me?)  
No grievances  
(Do you, without me?)  
Just trust me, believe in my intentions  
(Do you, without me?)
