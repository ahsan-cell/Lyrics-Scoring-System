**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
Deceit is everywhere,  
Hearts are filled with thieves, false smiles and lies.  
Oh, deceit is everywhere,  
Hearts are filled with thieves, false smiles and lies.  
People...

**[Verse 1]**  
There should be an expiration for hatred,  
A diary for true loves should exist.  
Build statues in the whole city of Laila and Majnu,  
In memory of true lovers, there should be poetry.  
Yeah!

**[Verse 2]**  
Souls that loved were once people,  
Beyond bodies, they were wanderers.  
Friends have left, all those mad ones have faded,  
Love became a choice, just a joke.  
I keep thoughts in my mind, talking on the street,  
Love remains, it’s just give and take,  
The trading of hearts has become a game.

**[Verse 3]**  
Here, faces are beautiful but hearts are all fake,  
It’s become a habit to crave money,  
Not knowing the worth of a penny.  
In this world, how can I believe? The devil roams, finding joy in humanity.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Star, Shah,  
How do you know?  
How did you know?

**[Chorus]**  
Deceit is everywhere,  
Hearts are filled with thieves, false smiles and lies.  
Oh, deceit is everywhere,  
Hearts are filled with thieves, false smiles and lies.  
People...

**[Instrumental-break]**

**[Bridge]**  
What else is love?  
It makes the heart alive.  
What else is love?  
Every heart's love story is true,  
Friends, it really is true.  
What else is love?  
My friend, what can I say?  
What is the essence of affection?  
What else is love?

**[Verse 4]**  
In the beginning, when man came into this world,  
He had nothing but love,  
And for true lovers, God created this universe.  
The name of great lovers was known,  
The name of great lovers was known.  
Hmm...

**[Verse 5]**  
False people have false promises,  
They seem to be deceiving.  
Making promises with someone else,  
While keeping them with another.  
With the ungrateful, they sit idle,  
Today, they are stars.  
When the world was wandering,  
Their names were lost in the dust.

**[Verse 6]**  
Tell me, what is worldly affairs?  
Friend, love is everything.  
Those who love cannot die,  
Love is such a precious thing.  
For love, I sacrifice,  
Eternal love is intoxicating.  
Wherever the talk of love arises,  
That’s where the world exists.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
What else is love?  
It makes the heart alive.  
What else is love?  
My friend, what can I say?  
What is the essence of affection?  
What else is love?

**[Chorus]**  
Deceit is everywhere,  
Hearts are filled with thieves, false smiles and lies.  
Oh, deceit is everywhere,  
Hearts are filled with thieves, false smiles and lies.  
People...
