**Translated Lyrics: "Ghetto Blaster"**

**[Part I]**

**[Intro: Joker & Allame]**  
Yeah, "Ghetto Blaster", listen baby  
Full [?] battle bootleg baby, yeah (Ah)  
C'mon (Let’s go)  
Allame (Listen up)  
Joker (Come on)  
Trabzon (Are you ready, are you ready?)  
Eskişehir, yeah, yeah (Come on, come on)  
Made in Batarya, c'mon (Hah, hah, hah, hah)

**[Verse 1: Allame & Joker]**  
Bring the academic rhyme man in front of me  
Rap lessons are taught by heart, they call this a "battle"  
No soldiers left in the field, blood will flow  
Compasses won't suffice for your ass  
A stroke hits my motherfucking dog  
Fall down immediately, "Don’t blow" they say  
Forget this, go sweat it out in the sauna with your mom  
The men screaming "Save me"  
Raise your hands to get into this vibe  
Is there still a ring to attack my rhythm?  
Look this way too, "Ghetto Blaster"  
Like a rhyme academy, it’s a circle [?]  
I’m victorious in my literature  
We couldn’t be media stars but we’re still here  
My rap includes my streets (Ha)

**[Part II]**

**[Intro]**  
(Dirty punk, you shouldn’t have scared those pigeons)  
(Ha, you want something from the old days, huh?)  
(I’ll play you something from the old days, dirty punk)  
(Let’s see)

**[Verse 2: Allame & Joker]**  
If I translate this rhyme in master style, it’ll be the language of Turkish  
Remember, right? What realm did my champion dreams wander?  
Wait a minute, did you talk back to me? Open your mouth, let me adjust you  
Come on, no need for an erection, are you all idiots?  
Wearing spotted thongs, girls like pawns with bows  
They adopt my rap, create a function  
No, I’m sure, ours is super tension  
Keep your distance, don’t mess it up, it’ll turn into sulfate  
Shake your arrow in the name of love, your tailbone will break there  
Don’t bring the old school into your mouth, your store will spoil while standing  
With the sun, you can get a girl, I’ll set the tone, your mind will break  
Ah, fall in line, motherfuck, don’t be stupid  
Watch your ass, take a breath, hold on tight to the free punchline  
This rhyme will hit, see it, if the commander stands up  
Those sons of bitches will make their graves their home if they swallow this pill

**[Chorus: Joker]**  
("Ghetto Blaster")

**[Part III]**

**[Verse 3: Joker & Allame]**  
[...]

The piggy bank is full, exchange the money  
Can’t find this flow, can it be cloned?  
I’m an icon, the one I read [?] gets stuck  
In hip-hop, I’m the coach, [?] stays

Chase my literature [?]  
[?]  
[?], even the Eiffel Tower won’t cut it  
[?] passes by me, slow down and brake

Set it in your head, you’re in incubation, my man  
You couldn’t become my eternal rival [?]  
[?]  
[?]

Touching your blood, twelve languages, bismillah  
This will make you feel [?]  
[?] blood can get spoiled  
I slapped death, seduced their sisters

**[Part IV]**

**[Intro]**  
(You deserve more than death, bitch)

**[Verse 4: Allame & Joker]**  
Don’t push too much below the belt, I’ll throw you out  
That’s why every word of mine is like an F16  
This "Ghetto Blaster" is a revolver, Joker is a Scud rocket

Lay the mat down, don’t break your ass, brother  
I’ll rent this ass if you say one word  
Eminem imitation fake, [?], [?] comes out often

To those I’ve shoved, I call them "boy"  
Gather from the wall, brain off the shelf, gay  
This punk is a bit different from your style

From thirty-six kilometers away, a shotgun is a single shot [?]  
[?], makes the guy sweat from his temple, fame  
This [?] is the son of a bitch, May Day

Follow from three hundred thousand light-years behind  
If the rhyme that sells your rap is what I’m doing  
Take it
