**Translated Lyrics:**

Listen to me, my friend  
You don’t need anything at all  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the river  

That’s enough, my friend  
Two lines are enough for a home  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the river  

[Verse 1]  
Your story is also my story  
Speak loudly, let the whole world hear  
Someone will wake you from your sleep  
And piece together your broken dream  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Beyond dreams, this is where we’ll go  
Everyone will recognize us  

[Chorus]  
Listen to me, my friend  
You don’t need anything at all  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the river  

That’s enough, my friend  
Two lines are enough for a home  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the river  

[Instrumental-break]  

[Verse 2]  
You want to live, but the truth haunts you  
Even things that aren’t said, the world creates  
Feet are on the ground, but the aim is on the moon  
The storms that come our way can be frightening  

[Bridge]  
No, no, no, don’t be afraid  
Now, never step back  
Everyone will know, everyone will know  

[Instrumental-break]  

[Verse 3]  
Who lives by dying over and over?  
Don’t turn your eyes away from life  
The tales of Sassi and Heer are old  
Show me something new  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The God who resides in hearts will accept us  
And everyone will agree  

[Chorus]  
Listen to me, my friend  
You don’t need anything at all  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the world  

That’s enough, my friend  
Two lines are enough for a home  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the river  

[Outro]  
To the other side of the river  
Let’s go now, to the other side of the river
