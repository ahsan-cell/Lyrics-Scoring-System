**Translated Lyrics:**

Measure the truth, those who are honest, line them up right away  
Those whose intentions are pure, line them up right away  
Even those who don’t take bribes, line them up right away  
Anyone who comes to cause trouble, line them up right away  

Line them up, line them all up  
Those who never change, just rhyme with "thief"  
Even those who don’t take bribes, line them up right away  
Anyone who comes to cause trouble, line them up right away  

Line them up, Sadiq, stay on the side  
If you cross the line, the sniper will pull the trigger  
Worshippers of wealth, what happens when their high fades?  
When cheap labor means taking someone’s rights away  
Here, the fear of landlords and ministers is greater than the army  
They don’t read Sun Tzu, but stay in the Art of War  
On southern lands, control from Lahore  
Local extortionists wave their flags at their checkpoints  
Invisible in their corners, but police are in their pockets  
If you see them, understand elections are near  
The poor public hopes for promises that are lies  
Revolutionary youth chant Iqbal on repeat  

Measure the truth, those who are honest, line them up right away  
Those whose intentions are pure, line them up right away  
Even those who don’t take bribes, line them up right away  
Anyone who comes to cause trouble, line them up right away  

Burst out and let it burst; this is the way here  
Politicians and the public are forced into this habit  
White-collar crime is a distant matter; how will the street vendor change?  
When to cut costs, they sell you dog meat  
Hypocrisy is light, like the walls of public schools  
They come out to drown their neighbors with nails  
Those who dream of defeating the establishment  
Write their own name on the missing persons list  
Distance from big cars, no clue about their guards  
Distance from beards, they’ve never understood the Quran  
Law enforcers need protection  
There’s benefit in violence; how have they not understood this yet?  

Measure the truth, those who are honest, line them up right away  
Those whose intentions are pure, line them up right away  
Even those who don’t take bribes, line them up right away  
Anyone who comes to cause trouble, line them up right away  

Line them up, line them all up  
Those who never change, just rhyme with "thief"  
Even those who don’t take bribes, line them up right away  
Anyone who comes to cause trouble, line them up right away
