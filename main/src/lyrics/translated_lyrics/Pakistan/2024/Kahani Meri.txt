**Translated Lyrics:**

Don’t ask me about my story,  
How has my life been?  
Don’t ask me about my story,  
How has my life been?  

All the stars in the sky,  
Even more than my home and walls.  

I’ve kept your mark hidden away,  
Don’t ask me about my story,  
How has my life been?  

I don’t want prayers, nor do I seek comfort,  
This is my rightful complaint to God.  
The world laughs at my tears,  
My love was not a spectacle.  

My youth passed in sorrow,  
Don’t ask me about my story,  
How has my life been?  
Don’t ask me about my story.
