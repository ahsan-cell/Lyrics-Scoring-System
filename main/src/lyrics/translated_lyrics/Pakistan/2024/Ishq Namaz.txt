**Translated Lyrics:**

**Today, Let's Recite The Prayer Of Love**  
**Let's Have A Conversation With Our Beloved**  

Never Have I Found A Companion Like You  
Never Have I Found A Companion Like You  
**Embrace Me Within Your Prostration Today**  

**Today, Let's Recite The Prayer Of Love**  
**Let's Have A Conversation With Our Beloved**  

**Oh Master, Oh Beloved Master**  
**Only Those Who Truly Love Will Understand**  
**They Will Recognize The Taste Of True Passion**  

**The Intoxication Of Love, Only The Lover Knows**  
**Bulleh Shah Also Earned Love**  
**Mansoor Came Smiling To The Gallows**  
**Waris Shah Imparted Lessons**  

**Before The Fire Of Love, There's No Force**  
**No One Greater Than The Beloved**  

**Just Follow The Championship Of Beloved**  
**Just Follow The Championship Of Beloved**  

**Only Through The Love Of The Ascetic, One Finds Solace**  
**Only Through The Love Of The Ascetic, One Finds Solace**  

**Do Not Commit Idolatry In The Name Of Love**  
**Do Not Commit Idolatry In The Name Of Love**  
**Do Not Be Adorned Even In Dreams**  

**Before The Fire Of Love, There's No Force**  
**No One Greater Than The Beloved**  

**Oh beloved, oh beloved**  
**Why Indulge In Love?**  
**Why Fill Someone Else's Breath?**  

**The Intoxication Of Love, Only The Lover Knows**  
**Who Else Can Bear Its Weight?**  

**Earn love, O Human,**  
**Accept The Call Of Love, O Human**  

**Mola, Mola**  

**Before The Fire Of Love, There's No Force**  
**No One Greater Than The Beloved**  

**Before The Fire Of Love, There's No Force**  
**No One Greater Than The Beloved**  

**Before The Fire Of Love, There's No Force**  
**No One Greater Than The Beloved**  

**Before The Fire Of Love, There's No Force**  
**No One Greater Than The Beloved**
