**Translated Lyrics:**

Tell me one thing, do you die in memories?  
Do you still love me?  
Tell me one thing, do you die in memories?  
Do you still love me?  

Who are you with now, what do you know about them?  
Can they silence you?  
Who are you with now, what do you know about them?  
Can they silence you?  
Jaani filled the ocean with tears, do you also fill rivers with your tears?  

Tell me one thing, do you die in memories?  
Do you still love me?  

Ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra ra  
Ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho ho  

No one answers my questions,  
I keep asking myself over and over.  
I keep asking myself over and over.  

I love those who love me, or the one I love,  
Or the one I love.  
There’s such a difference between my love and theirs,  
We were afraid of you, you’re afraid of them.

Do you still love me?  

Re re ra ra ra ra re re ra ra ra ra ra  

Who is it that asks my companion about me every time?  
They call out to you by name many times.  
They call out to you by name many times.  
If we didn’t belong to you, would they belong to us?  
We promise, do you promise too?  

Tell me one thing, do you die in memories?  
Do you still love me?  

Don’t make me remember so much, it might break my heart,  
I might have to leave the one I belong to now.  
Don’t make me remember so much, it might break my heart,  
I might have to leave the one I belong to now.  

[Outro: Akshay Kumar's Voice]  
Say whatever you need to say,  
Why are you so afraid?  
Did you love us more,  
Or do you love them more?  

Now that I’ve left,  
Now answer me,  
Do you still love me?
