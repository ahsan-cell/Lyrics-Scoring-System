**Translated Lyrics:**

Ain't nobody get me going better than my chica girl  
Chica, chica, chica, that's my chica girl  
Ain't nobody get me going better than my chica girl  

You are the one on the paths, you are the one in my sight  
One day, my heart was bound to lose itself  
I saw you, I desired you, I searched for you, I found you  
What happened upon finding you was meant to be  

So come on, whatever happens now  
You say "yes" or "no"  
In my heart, it's only you  
Now it's forever and ever  

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  

Never even try to win me over  
You won't be able to have me  
You’ll wander around pretending to be a lover  
But you won’t belong anywhere  

So come on, whatever happens now  
You say "yes" or "no"  
In my heart, it's only you  
Now it's forever and ever  

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  

Chica, chica, chica, that's my chica girl  
Ain't nobody get me going better than my chica girl  
Chica, chica, chica, that's my chica girl  
Ain't nobody get me going better than my chica girl  

There are many who adore me in this world  
But why should I look at anyone else when I see you?  
The distance between the earth and the sky  
Understand that’s how far away I am  

So come on, whatever happens now  
You say "yes" or "no"  
In my heart, it's only you  
Now it's forever and ever  

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  

You are the one on the paths, you are the one in my sight  
One day, my heart was bound to lose itself  
I saw you, I desired you, I searched for you, I found you  
What happened upon finding you was meant to be  

So come on, whatever happens now  
You say "yes" or "no"  
In my heart, it's only you  
Now it's forever and ever  

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, my love, now it's forever  
Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on, now forever, darling
