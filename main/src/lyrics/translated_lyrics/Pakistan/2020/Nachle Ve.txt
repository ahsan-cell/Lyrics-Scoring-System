**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part 1]**
The realm of music we create  
Is to use sound to paint a picture  
A picture carved with many details  
Each detail splits into a thousand pieces  
A piece described by many lines  
A line will be broken into many flows  
But above all else,  
The essence of the lyrics is paramount  
Distinguishing between the level of a hen and a hawk  
What is Vietnamese rap really?  
Does it even exist?  
But there’s always one thing that’s clear  
Wherever there’s a scent of diss, you see them gather  
In the present or in the future  
Good omens or accompanied by disasters  
Fool or genius,  
We must ask who the times favor  
I don’t like peace at all  
Because it reveals the hypocrisy of righteousness  
I prefer a silent revolution  
Because then good and evil won’t be divided  
If your music soars high just to seek me out  
Then I assert that’s a narrow-minded view  
Art is a vast ocean where my crew sets sail  
How can you drown me in a sea of resentment?  
Five-star wisdom is constructive intelligence  
From that, the universe of music is born  
The price haunts the minds of the living  
Deeper than any tattoo on skin  
It’s where life gives you empty hands  
And a hell you must endure  
Go ahead, I’ll let you know in advance  
One day you won’t trust the living, only the dead  
So don’t provoke those original codes  
Analyzing entities without form  
Because when you’re a faulty version  
The command is to skip, not follow a process  
You take this market as your raw material  
Then I take you as my raw material  
Creating music meant for artists  
That when artists hear, it elevates them  
I am the reality that always causes you pain  
Going through it means giving up or growing fast  
Discrimination, distinction, extremism to the core  
Yet why is it so close and pleasant?  
With Vietnamese rap fans, it’s a poetic insult  
It’s diss, it’s poetry, it’s beefing each other  
But when it enters the consciousness of the subject  
You see clearly: That’s magic  
That’s a test  
Simply put, it can be imagined like a collective battle  
So look into history  
The opponent is treated equally by G  
One is you rap, two is you trash  
Three is you quit or pretend to stop rapping  
When you’re scared, it means you’ve lost  
This challenge isn’t bitter or sour  
When a diss track becomes a hit  
No need for clickbait, does it have substance?  
The day you work with my disciple you diss  
The garden of greens before was a waste  
So did I diss right, or did I diss wrong?  
Why does everyone go to the South side?  
Is it because the market is big, or because of someone?  
Or because they just don’t know what to do?  
All attention given to the work  
So if your name is there, you should be proud  
Conquering the game, maintaining the style  
Spreading thoughts, who has time for trivial matters?  
Not sharing the pie, I’m not snatching food  
Or my music could turn someone into ice  
Or you have a place, but that spot becomes tense  
How can I lose my legacy like you lost your scarf?  
Vietnamese rap is deteriorating, gasping  
And blame it on G, we’re cutting the breath  
We are not the problem  
To loosen the knot  
We are a distinct identity  
And it’s always immobile at  
The place you’re being directed  
So don’t raise your voice in anger  
Mistakenly, raising your voice to scold  
Scolding me for low skill  
OK, still gotta watch the way to the herd  
Scolding me for arrogance  
OK, my music contains treasures  
Scolding me for poetry  
OK, if you like, I’ll burn it down  
My music makes you sleepy  
OK, after you’ve drunk enough  
Call me conservative?  
Oh no, I’ve only seen myself getting...  
Calling me striped?  
Oh no, I’m here green - red - yellow star  
Saying I’m looking for trouble?  
Oh no, defecating in the village pond  
You can say whatever you want  
G’s music still fills the floor  
Many see me rap like this surely  
Makes them suffer and many feel stuck  
But we still passionately enjoy  
Who has time like anyone sitting there making facts?  
Real music afraid of being stale?  
Or is it because your mouth is fake so afraid of being obsolete?  
Quế eyes release an announcement  
For the loyal Chinese dogs  
That it has been caught by G-Fam’s plan  
Distinguishing ethnicity or region  
Is due to
