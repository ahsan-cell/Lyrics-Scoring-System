**Translated Lyrics:**

Rain is falling on the roof, inside it's burning up like a party  
My city seems to light up in the dark of night. I love my city  
I step out of the elevator, they turn me up like Playboi Carti  
Rock boys go moshpit, all of my homies rolling  
Yo WAVY, yeah I'm still living and doing what I want just like before  
What I smoke is OG, I write melodies while hustling  
I can't let my feelings drown. If you don't like me, ignore it  
At the end of the month, no worries because I know how to get that money  
Okay (kay), if I want it, I take it (take it)  
Yeah, I'm gonna come and get it  
Back to my hood, I’ll share it  
That's how we do, we get it  
Go broke in a minute  
Come back, undefeated  
Gucci on my feet (wow), we 'bout to get lit, yeah  
Outside with the mob (mob). Can’t see me, I'm a ghost (hidden)  
Haters wanna see me lost (yeah). One way, take a shot (yeah)  
Every day I pray to the Lord (hold up)  
Wake up, get some more (more)  
Sometimes I feel alone, but loneliness makes me strong  
Rain is falling on the roof, inside it's burning up like a party  
My city seems to light up in the dark of night. I love my city  
I step out of the elevator. They turn me up like Playboi Carti  
Rock boys go moshpit, all of my homies rolling  

Yeah. Twenty-four K ice Rolex, that's what I want (want it)  
Not playing, inviting you down (hold up)  
Don’t waste what I roll (hold up)  
Tall houses stacked in rows (yeah)  
Late at night, not afraid to go against the flow (yeah)  
What’s under my tongue shows me I'm on the right path (yeah)  
Bihhh just wanna bullshit  
Laid-back on the sofa  
Ocean Mob saying hello  
I don't talk with ya  
Bihhh just wanna bullshit  
Laid-back on the sofa  
Ocean Mob saying hello  
I don't talk with ya, like woah woah woah woah  
Looking my knee low  
Hashtag #takesomepose  
Looking my knee low

[TLINH]  
(Drive all the night)  
I’m a superstar born with my heart tainted  
(Drive all the night)  
You can hear the sirens in my first cry  
(Drive me all the night)  
I’m a bad fucking angel with my wings tied  
(Drive me all the night)  
I’m not yet to be alive  
NIGHT saxophone playing  

[DA/MD]  
Gliding on the freeway with my DA crew  
Hands together and soaring, yeah I'm off now  
OBE entering soul city, everything strikes through  
I’m the hidden frequency captured by that mic  
Still only me alone. (Still only me alone)  
Still only me alone. (Still only me alone)  
Rain is falling on the roof, I’m flying in that water  
Looking down at the colorful night city  
Soul city killing me softly, I feel like I'm losing all sensations in my head  
Rain is falling on the roof, I’m flying in that water  
Looking down at the colorful night city  
Soul city killing me softly, I feel like I'm losing all sensations in my head
