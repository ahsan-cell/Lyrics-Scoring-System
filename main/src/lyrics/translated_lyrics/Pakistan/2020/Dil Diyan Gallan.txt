**Translated Lyrics:**

Bind me to you  
In true friendships, friendships, friendships  
There are no distances  
This anger of yours is just paper-thin  
Listen to me, my beloved  

The words of the heart  
We'll share while sitting side by side  
Eye to eye, gazing into each other  
The words of the heart, oh  
We'll do this every day  
Fulfilling our true love  

Why do you torment me?  
Why do you show me?  
Just pretending to be upset and sulking  
The words of the heart, oh  
We'll share while sitting side by side  
Eye to eye, gazing into each other  

I’ll keep you hidden from the world  
Adorning my eyes, you are my loyalty  
Keep me as your own  
I come for you  
I come for you, my friend  
Let there never be distances  

I live for you...  
I live for you  
You live for me  
Just tell me why you tease me like this  

The words of the heart  
We'll share while sitting side by side  
Eye to eye, gazing into each other  
The words of the heart...  

The dark nights, dark, dark  
Are with my heart, dusky  
My sorrows, sorrows, sorrows  
Feel like you’re not in my embrace  

My sky doesn’t listen to the seasons  
No dream gets fulfilled  
The words of the heart  
We'll share while sitting side by side  
Eye to eye, gazing into each other  
I know why you look at me secretly  
Joining your name with mine  
The words of the heart  
We'll share while sitting side by side  
Eye to eye, gazing into each other  
The words of the heart...
