**Translated Lyrics:**

Fans of our style,  
Don’t copy any star’s vibe.  

Oh, the new ones rising,  
Fans of our style,  
Don’t copy any star’s vibe.  
Oh, they leave a mark on hearts,  
Cruising in a friend’s Jaguar.  

Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A vintage look from your friend.  
Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A royal look from your friend.  

Perfume wafts, asking for colors,  
In the streets, friends don’t mess with girls.  
With a decent touch, they seem dull,  
But a casual hello opens up the fun.  
In the poses we strike for photos,  
Oh, it becomes a viral story then.  

Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A vintage look from your friend.  
Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A royal look from your friend.  

Button-down collars, the stylish Jatt,  
They know how to pick the best of the lot.  
When they speak, they lead with charm,  
Top-notch Jatts are rare to find.  

Button-down collars, the stylish Jatt,  
They know how to pick the best of the lot.  
When they speak, they lead with charm,  
Top-notch Jatts are rare to find.  
Where no one else is making a scene,  
The requests flow easily there, my friend.  

Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A vintage look from your friend.  
Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A royal look from your friend.  

With drinks in hand, the party’s alive,  
Where are the glasses from our parents?  
They keep their wooden pistols close,  
Dhillon’s sound echoes from afar.  

What a gathering it was, not just any show,  
Made the front page of the newspaper.  
Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A vintage look from your friend.  
Oh, wearing boot cuts,  
Catching eyes as we walk by,  
A royal look from your friend.
