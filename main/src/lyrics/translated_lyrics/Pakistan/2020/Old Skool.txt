**Translated Lyrics:**

Aahaa  
Oh, you guys are killers now (Prem Dhillon)  
—oh really? (Sidhu Moose Wala!)  
Catch you coming out of your damn house, dude  
Aye yo, The Kidd  

[Verse 1: Prem Dhillon & Sidhu Moose Wala]  
Hey, don’t be scared, just tell me how it feels  
Who’s bothering you, tell me who it is (Come on)  
Look at the circumstances, they’ve made you this way  
I’ll show you how to stand up and fight, just watch me  

[Chorus: Prem Dhillon]  
Old school, the vibe of friends is alive  
Old school, that’s why there’s so much hype  
Old school, the crew of the Jatt is here  
Old school, the ones who hustle are the Jatts  
Old school, old school, old school, alright, alright  

[Verse 2: Prem Dhillon]  
Hey girl, your neck is like a beautiful vase  
You’ve become the reason for my destruction  
Those who comment on me, they’re just jealous  
You too, don’t hide, let’s show what we’ve got  
Old school, old school, old school...  
Hey old school, I’ve got a muscle car  
My friends are always ready, 24/7  
God damn, you’re shining like a star  
Every moment I think about you, you walk like old school...  

[Chorus: Prem Dhillon & Prodigy]  
Hey old school, the vibe of friends is alive  
Old school, that’s why there’s so much hype  
Old school, the crew of the Jatt is here  
Old school, the ones who hustle are the Jatts  
Old school... yeah yeah  
Hey old school...  
(I'm no shorty, dude, I stop your glory)  

[Verse 3: Prem Dhillon]  
Yeah, your eyes are on the boy from Dhillon  
Looks like Danny but don’t mistake him for a thug  
Don’t act pure when you’re just playing games  
If you mess with me, I’ll make you regret it  
Old school, don’t mess with me, I’ll make it hard  
The Jatt’s preference is clear, so why not speak up?  
Well-known in the middle, don’t ask too many questions  
No, don’t just play around, keep it old school...  

[Chorus: Prem Dhillon]  
Old school, the vibe of friends is alive  
Old school, that’s why there’s so much hype  
Old school, the crew of the Jatt is here  
Old school, the ones who hustle are the Jatts  
Old school, old school, old school...  

[Verse 4: NseeB & Sidhu Moose Wala]  
6 0 4  
Just like the laws in Syria, that’s how the boys roll  
They keep their fingers on the pulse and watch for enemies  
Those who shoot don’t miss, your eyes are mesmerizing  
You’re the choice of the Jatt, your city knows it  
Stay humble, think wisely  
Friendship shouldn’t shrink  
With a gentle look, the boy stands out  
Thought rebels keep bad connections at bay  
You’re the one I want close to me  
Came from Surrey, they call him NseeB  
He doesn’t ask for much, just time  
The boy sits and rhymes about your beauty  
Your traditional turban and principles, old school  
Asking Rohru, he’s got the tools, old school  
The Jatt fuels the rhythm, old school  
Don’t underestimate the value of friendship  

[Interlude: Sidhu Moosewala]  
Hey, listen up!  

[Verse 5: Sidhu Moosewala]  
Hey, big things are happening  
There’s a lot going on behind the scenes  
Check out the style of the boy  
Sweet like honey, with a charming gaze  
The Jatt brings the era back  
Pay attention,  
32 extendo divides the Jatt’s game  
Hitting the right notes, that’s the Jatt’s claim  
He’s making waves in the world  
See the flag waving in the air, that’s the Jatt’s pride  
Hey, Moose Wala stays in the spotlight  
You’ll hear the talk in the crowd  
Hey, many have come and gone  
Here, the world earns its keep in two years  

[Chorus: Sidhu Moosewala]  
Hey old school, just like the way it should be  
Old school, rocking the black style  
Today’s date won’t break the Jatt’s spirit  
Old school, when the boy shines bright  
Old school, when the boy shines bright  
Old school, when the boy shines bright  
Old school!  

[Outro: Sidhu Moosewala & Prodigy
