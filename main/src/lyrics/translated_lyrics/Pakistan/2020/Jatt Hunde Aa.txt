**Translated Lyrics:**

With the clouds rolling in, I come alive  
Wearing Ray-Bans even in church, I thrive  
With the clouds rolling in, I come alive  
With a Blackberry, they’re all around me,  
Saying they want to be close,  
When I hear them, it’s like a kick to my soul.  

Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.  

When they sit down,  
They’re the ones who shine,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.

Hey, stop opening those files,  
Those who come to eat, they’re just for show,  
They roll in fresh, no doubt,  
Don’t you dare stay home, just step out.  
You might also like,  
Hey, don’t let their gaze catch you,  
Don’t sit too close,  
They’re always up to something.  

Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.  

When they sit down,  
They’re the ones who shine,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.  

Stand tall with that slang,  
They’re sipping drinks like goats,  
Phones set, they’re ready to roll,  
Then they share their woes with their girls,  
Phones set, they’re ready to roll,  
Then they share their woes with their girls.  

Look at him, he’s not alone,  
He’s singing high notes,  
With a crew of four or five,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.  

When they sit down,  
They’re the ones who shine,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.  

Oh, look at Denny, the Dhillon boy,  
He’s got a vibe that outshines the stars,  
That guy, always laughing,  
He lives in the hearts of the ladies.  

Oh, those who stay up late,  
They come running,  
And when they leave, they linger on.  

Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.  

When they sit down,  
They’re the ones who shine,  
Jatts are here,  
Oh, the Jatts are here.
