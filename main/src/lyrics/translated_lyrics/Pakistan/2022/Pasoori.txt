**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Ali Sethi]**  
If the fire of necessity burns,  
And the pain of separation comes,  
Becomes poison, yes, your love,  
I drink it all in full.  
He was supposed to come, but he didn’t,  
My heart collided with a bang.  
The crow speaks and tells me,  
Of the theft of the ghee (clarified butter).

**[Pre-Chorus: Ali Sethi]**  
On the paths, in the lanes, I’ll hide him,  
Let no one stop me.

**[Chorus: Ali Sethi]**  
My beloved, how can you know about the sorrows of separation?  
Come back, even if your heart isn’t whole.  
Yes, how can we talk about the tales of love?  
Come back, even if your heart isn’t whole.

**[Verse 2: Shae Gill]**  
I’ve forgotten the necessity,  
The rules of this world,  
Your company is essential,  
It’s necessary to fulfill.  
He was supposed to come, but he didn’t,  
Didn’t show me the way.  
Our hearts are supported,  
But our desires remain unfulfilled.

**[Pre-Chorus: Shae Gill]**  
I’ll go again, I’ll call you,  
Let’s talk about everything.

**[Chorus: Shae Gill]**  
My beloved, how can you know about the sorrows of separation?  
Come back, even if your heart isn’t whole.  
Yes, how can we talk about the tales of love?  
Come back, even if your heart isn’t whole.

**[Bridge: Shae Gill & Ali Sethi]**  
My beloved, let there be no leadership in separation.  
My beloved, in separation...  
My beloved, let there be no leadership in separation.  
Let there be no suffering for all lovers.  
Let there be no suffering for all lovers.  
Come, let’s take you away,  
Where the connections are.  
You are the one; it’s your absence.  
Make us, adorn us, give us shelter.  
Make us, adorn us, give us shelter.

**[Refrain: Ali Sethi]**  
If the fire of necessity burns,  
And the pain of separation comes,  
Becomes poison, yes, your love,  
I drink it all in full.

**[Pre-Chorus: Ali Sethi]**  
On the paths, in the lanes, I’ll hide him,  
Let no one stop me.

**[Chorus: Ali Sethi & Shae Gill]**  
My beloved, how can you know about the sorrows of separation?  
Come back, even if your heart isn’t whole.  
Yes, how can we talk about the tales of love?  
Come back, even if your heart isn’t whole.

**[Outro: Shae Gill & Ali Sethi]**  
Even if your heart isn’t whole,  
Even if your heart isn’t whole.
