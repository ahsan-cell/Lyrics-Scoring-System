**Translated Lyrics:**

When you looked at me, my state turned bad  
My heart longs to be with you, oh so sad  
My heart longs to be with you, oh so sad  

Oh, this heart has been struck by love's arrows  
This heart has been struck by love's arrows  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  

Oh, the moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  

Your eyes play games that are truly divine  
They give answers, yet never ask a sign  
Your eyes play games that are truly divine  
They give answers, yet never ask a sign  

We've distanced ourselves from the world, lost in your embrace  
We've distanced ourselves from the world, lost in your embrace  
Every moment, I’m filled with thoughts of you  
Oh, your gestures and your eyes have captivated me  
Your gestures and your eyes have captivated me  

The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  

You might also like long nights of separation  
Long nights of separation  
Long nights of separation  
Long nights of separation  
You want me like the moon, no need for wealth or gain  

Once you leave, you never come back again  
My beloved, you don’t turn around to see me then  
Once you leave, you never come back again  
My beloved, you don’t turn around to see me then  

You sit with others, keeping your distance from me  
You sit with others, keeping your distance from me  
People say you don’t keep your promises true  
These rumors about you have struck me through  
These rumors about you have struck me through  

The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  

Oh, in your eyes, I see my fate, don’t you know?  
Just once, make peace with my heart, let it show  
Can anyone overpower the heart’s desire?  
I can’t trust you even for a moment, I tire  
Your words, both false and true, have struck me deep  
Your words, both false and true, have struck me deep  

The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  

Captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow  
The moonlight, my beloved, has captured me in its glow
