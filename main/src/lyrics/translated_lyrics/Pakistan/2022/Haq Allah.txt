**Translated Lyrics:**

The greatest courage is waking up in good spirits  
Putting on a smile, saying good morning, making breakfast  
Then rushing out into the fierce world  
Giving you a quick kiss, keeping my voice calm  
Look over there, a dad's off to Kazakhstan  
To drill the sea  
Another gets paid every month  
Because he wears a military uniform  
Some go to the post office, some to the hospital, some to the junkyard  
I kill myself every day with these stupid drafts  
I’m always working, sometimes I seem absent  
But the current doesn’t sweep me away  
I’m with you, I’m by your side  
I think about money too, it’s a duty, but not too much  
I think of you when I go out and sing  
And I’m an enthusiast  
At first glance  
I always say hi to everyone, how nice, what are you up to?  
Give me a hug  
That’s a job too  
I come home a wreck  
Now come with me  
I’ll show you what I do  

**[Chorus]**  
When I say hands up for the Assalti Frontali  
My hands go to the sky for great ideals  
Things may seem the same but they’re always different  
Beyond the outcome, they will never be lost battles  
We aim high, even higher, and then even more  
Life rushes on, and if no one helps you  
Remember, when you’re down, that  
I’m with you  

Being on stage has always been a celebration for me  
To gather courage at first, I covered my face and head  
A red bandana, a nice black hat  
Over time I took it all off, I just need to be simple and true  
Before stepping onto the scene  
And putting myself in view  
I tried a job like this  
As an accountant  
It lasted two hours  
Love didn’t last long either  
I take a walk  
Better not to fool myself  
Maybe we’ll meet again in twenty years  
Now I talk a little less, still looking far away  
I’d like to always be there to defend you and lend a hand  
But I can wish you a good day and truly mean it  
For my part, the more I grow, the less I can stand  
Diderot sold his library to live  
Marx had three children who died, starved blind  
Galileo was imprisoned, Giordano Bruno burned  
Each of them deserved to be loved much more  

**[Chorus]**  
When I say hands up for the Assalti Frontali  
My hands go to the sky for great ideals  
Things may seem the same but they’re always different  
Beyond the outcome, they will never be lost battles  
We aim high, even higher, and then even more  
Life rushes on, and if no one helps you  
Remember, when you’re down, that  
I’m with you
