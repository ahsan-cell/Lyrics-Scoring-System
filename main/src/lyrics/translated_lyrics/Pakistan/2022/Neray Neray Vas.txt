**Translated Lyrics:**

Quench the thirst of my eyes,  
I’ve walked the path of yours, my beloved!  
Oh, my heart can't beat without you, today I've made a decision.  
Oh, quench the thirst of my eyes,  
I’ve walked the path of yours.  
I gaze at your face,  
Come close, let me win you over.  
I gaze at your face,  
Sitting beside you, let me win you over.

Oh, come closer, my dear, I keep loving you,  
Come closer, my dear, I keep loving you.  
Come closer, my dear, I keep loving you,  
Come closer, my dear, I keep loving you.

Forget about the others, listen to me,  
Why do you look at me from afar every day?  
Can’t you spare a little time for me?  
Why do you keep moving away from me?  
Forget about the others, listen to me,  
Why do you look at me from afar every day?  
Can’t you spare a little time for me?  
Why do you keep moving away from me?

Oh, beautiful and fragrant, I’m yours,  
With my eyes, I’ve caught you in my net.  
Oh, beautiful and fragrant, I’m yours,  
With my eyes, I’ve caught you in my net.  
Oh, I would die for you, my love,  
Only you stand by me, looking so good.  
Oh, I would die for you, my love,  
Only you stand by me, looking so good.

I bow down for you, my beloved,  
You look at me, don’t stop gazing.  
I bow down for you, my beloved,  
You look at me, don’t stop gazing.

You become my veil, I sit only in your shade,  
You become my mirror, for you are all I desire.  
You become my veil, I sit only in your shade,  
You become my mirror, for you are all I desire.

Oh, I gaze at your face,  
Come close, let me win you over.  
I gaze at your face,  
Sitting beside you, let me win you over.

Oh, come closer, my dear, I keep loving you,  
Come closer, my dear, I keep loving you.  
Come closer, my dear, I keep loving you,  
Come closer, my dear, I keep loving you.

Oh, I would die for you, my love,  
Only you stand by me, looking so good.  
Oh, I would die for you, my love,  
Only you stand by me, looking so good.  
Oh, I would die for you, my love,  
Only you stand by me, looking so good.  
Oh, I would die for you, my love,  
Only you stand by me, looking so good.
