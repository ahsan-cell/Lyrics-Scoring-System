**Translated Lyrics:**

Beloved, I found you  
Beloved, I found you  
With tired eyes, oh God,  
Beloved, I found you  
Beloved, I found you  

Unite me with myself, oh God! Grant me some connection  
I’m starting to lose myself  
Let my tears fall, the ones that make you smile  
I’m starting to lose myself  

Carefree, my love, don’t be upset with me  
Carefree!  

How I long for my beloved, like anyone would ask for something  
What do they ask for?  
The prayers I seek, they haven’t been found, not in this world  
Not in this world!  

Whatever you’ve written, oh God, you know it well  
I’m asking you for it  
Whatever my wish is, oh God, you know it too  
I stand before you with truth  

Carefree, my love, don’t be upset with me  
Carefree!  
Carefree!  
Carefree!  
Carefree!  
Carefree!  
Carefree! (Carefree!)  
(Don’t be upset)  

There will come a day, a night,  
That will be mine, just for me (my love)  
I’ll listen to all the beats of his heart  
Oh God knows when it will happen!  

Unite me with my beloved, oh God! Now grant me some connection  
I’m starting to lose myself  
Let my tears fall, the ones that make you smile  
I’ve been standing before you for so long  
Carefree, my love, don’t be upset with me
