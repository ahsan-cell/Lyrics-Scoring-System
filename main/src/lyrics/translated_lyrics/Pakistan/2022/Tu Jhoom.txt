**Translated Lyrics:**

I embrace the trees,  
And I walk on smiling.  
Oh, I embrace the trees,  
And I walk on smiling.  
Fighting against the heat, I searched for my shade,  
Both sorrow and joy are mine, and this is all I know.  
"What should I do, understanding everyone?"  
I try to explain this to my heart.

**[Chorus: Naseebo Lal]**  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway.

**[Verse 2: Abida Parveen]**  
I’m crazy, knowing nothing,  
Singing in a state of bliss.  
Pleasing the world, yet still,  
Peace doesn’t come to me.  
If all happiness comes, what will remain behind?  
If all happiness comes, what will remain behind?  
"There’s nothing in your control,"  
I try to explain this to my heart.

**[Chorus: Abida Parveen & Choir]**  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
Oh, you sway, sway, sway, sway.  
You sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
Oh, you sway.

**[Instrumental Break]**

**[Verse 3: Naseebo Lal]**  
I’m content with my being,  
I’m above my own status.  
This world doesn’t concern me,  
I’ve understood everything.

**[Verse 4: Abida Parveen]**  
What should be done with high shoulders?  
What should be done with the heavens?  
I live by laughing,  
I’ve escaped from the wanderings.

**[Bridge: Naseebo Lal & Abida Parveen]**  
I am like myself,  
Why should I feel shy?  
To please the world,  
Yet still, peace doesn’t come to me.  
What is yours will find you, just make an excuse.  
"There’s nothing in your control,"  
I try to explain this to my heart.

**[Chorus: Abida Parveen, Naseebo Lal & Choir]**  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway.  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
Oh, you sway, sway, sway, sway.  
You sway, sway, sway, sway,  
You sway, sway, sway, sway.  
You sway, sway, sway, sway.

**[Post-Chorus: Abida Parveen & Naseebo Lal]**  
I’m crazy, knowing nothing,  
I’m crazy, I’m crazy,  
I’m crazy.  
Oh, I’m crazy, knowing nothing,  
I’m intoxicated, knowing nothing,  
I’m intoxicated, knowing nothing,  
Knowing nothing, you sway, you sway, sway, sway, sway.  
I’m content with my being, you sway, sway, sway, sway.

**[Outro: Abida Parveen & Naseebo Lal]**  
Ah, gaze, gaze,  
Oh!  
The gaze of the beloved, who reveals secrets, you sway, sway, sway, sway.  
(You sway, sway, sway, sway) Why shouldn’t they take pride in their fortune?  
Why shouldn’t they take pride in their fortune?  
Take pride! Oh, you sway, sway, sway, sway.  
You sway, you sway, you,  
Oh, you sway, sway, sway, sway.  
You sway, sway, sway, sway.
