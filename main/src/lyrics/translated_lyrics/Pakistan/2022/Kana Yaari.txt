**[Chorus: Kaifi Khalil]**  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!

**[Verse 1: Kaifi Khalil]**  
Love of the humble, of the master and disciples,  
Love of the saints, of God’s chosen ones.  
What is this love that burns like a fire?  
A burden and a moon, who can bear its weight?  
This love is a light that shines in the dark,  
O Prophet of love, you are the one who leads.

**[Chorus: Kaifi Khalil]**  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!

**[Verse 2: Eva B]**  
What use is friendship if it’s just a pretense?  
Friendship is a path where intentions are clear.  
I am with you, don’t doubt my loyalty,  
My heart is yours, I won’t break my promise.  
When you speak, I see the light in your eyes,  
There’s no benefit in hiding behind false smiles.  
I’ll share my secrets, let them be known,  
Don’t let sorrow silence your voice.  
Friendship is a treasure, don’t let it fade away,  
My heart aches when you’re in pain,  
We are opposites, yet we are friends,  
You are the hunter, but I am not your prey.  
A friend can become an enemy, and an enemy a friend,  
But I am content as long as you hold my heart.

**[Verse 3: Kaifi Khalil]**  
You are a wonder, oh how beautiful!  
You are a treasure, oh how precious!  
You are my path,  
And I am weary without you.  
I am poor, but my heart is pure,  
You are rich, forgive me for my longing.  
May God bless your life,  
While I suffer in silence.  
You are in the Gulf, you are thriving,  
While I am lost in despair.  
Your love is a wave that washes over me,  
I am but a patient soul, longing for you.  
This world is full of deceit in love,  
But love is not a game in this world.  
This world is a chest that holds your love.

**[Bridge: Wahab Bugti]**  
Hold my hand, dear, hold it tight,  
Enemies turn to friends, promises bloom.  
People are like paper, easily torn,  
But my heart beats for you, my beloved.

**[Chorus: Wahab Bugti, Kaifi Khalil & Eva B]**  
What a cry of a hundred sorrows,  
First, let there be love!  
What a cry of a hundred sorrows,  
First, let there be love!  
First, let there be love!  
First, let there be love!  
What a betrayal of love, oh beloved!

**[Outro: Wahab Bugti, Kaifi Khalil & Eva B]**  
A friend can become an enemy, and an enemy a friend,  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
I am content as long as you hold my heart,  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
Oh, the beloved of love!  
Oh, the beloved of love!
