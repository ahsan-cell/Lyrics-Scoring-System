**Translated Lyrics:**

**(Verse 1 – Hashim Nawaz)**  
Hey! We don’t need to tell you what we are  
The world knows, it’s the city of Pindi  
They ask for so much, but there’s no kindness in return  
Don’t let small troubles get to you  
One by one, they’re all scoundrels  
Living in the moment, forgetting the past  
Singing old songs in the morning and driving at night  
But our hearts are big (oh, so big!)  
We bow down to meet, nothing goes unnoticed  
The love we give always comes back, the car is big but the company is with Honda  
Pindi city, check how many are here  
Stay happy even if troubles come  
Once they say, “Don’t repeat that”  
Asking for charity from the one who gives, oh God  
We’re happy, don’t ask about tomorrow, we’re always hungry  
Whatever comes our way, we take it  
We’re new, you’re not my bro  
We’re Pindi boys, who are your brothers?  
Meaningful relationships, hold them close to your heart  
Mistakes in thinking, take Pindi to Pindi  

**(Hook – Khawar Malik)**  
My boys drive Mehran from Karachi to Lahore  
My Pindi boys party till 4  
Girl, turn up the beat, sit in my backseat  
Pindi boys, the best choice  
Play this track on repeat!  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
This city is Pindi  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
This city is Pindi  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
This city is Pindi  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
Bawa ji, it’s Pindi  

**(Verse 2 - Zeeru)**  
It’s about the people of Pindi  
They think they’re burgers, their life is like pogo sticks  
They laugh at us when they see  
We’re just boys, don’t need anyone’s approval  
Pindi boy, Pindi boy, it’s on our lips  
We stay happy, even if we say something else  
But when you’ve heard a curse  
Then the boys pick up their guns  
When there’s a ruckus, we don’t run in fear  
Even if there are more boys, we still fight  
If there’s trouble, we’ll threaten you  
We’ll fight again, after reading all the issues  
We play games in the small streets  
More than uncles, it’s kids’ games  
Malik and Raja, every kid’s name  
Pindi may be small, but it’s not lacking in fame  

**(Verse 3 - Shuja Shah)**  
Pindi boys are truly stormy  
They don’t let the old ones rest  
Kids are kids, but they have a craze  
Making noise and doing wheelies  
If we talk about the food here  
Mamu’s burgers, Nawaz’s pastries  
What can I say about Banni’s breakfast?  
We eat Savour rice every night  
Raja is famous for doing wheelies  
In the streets of Malik/Abbasi/Chaudhry  
From morning to evening, there’s always a buzz  
Raja Bazaar, Sheikhay’s ‘veli’  
You can’t deny it, these guys are real  
The streets are small, but the hearts are big  
Google it, we’re not famous for no reason  
If you’re a hater of Pindi, then get lost!  

**(Hook – Khawar Malik)**  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
This city is Pindi  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
This city is Pindi  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
This city is Pindi  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
Bawa ji, it’s Pindi  

**(Verse 4 - Hamzee)**  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here  
Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, Pindi’s here, city  
Raja’s got the call, Malik opens fire  
I’m chilling, flame in hand  
Don’t blame my city  
This vibe is
