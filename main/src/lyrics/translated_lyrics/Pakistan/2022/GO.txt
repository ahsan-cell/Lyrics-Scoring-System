**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Black eye, blue smile  
Hyper-tactile  
You could say a single word  
And it could make my vision blurred  
I'm all nerve ends  
All sense, no sense  
Live to get my feelings hurt  
Sentimental amateur  

**[Verse 2: Atif Aslam]**  
Every morning starts with that same fragrance  
Lost in dreams, I sing, the bells ring  
As I step forward again,  
How do I express what I don't understand?  
I can't help it  
What kind of limit is this? How would I know?  
My heart pours out like rain,  
Every desire holds what's true,  
How do I reveal this? Tell me, will you?  

**[Chorus: Abdulla Siddiqi & Atif Aslam]**  
Go! 'Cause I never take it slow  
Here I am, I come every day  
I knew it from the get-go  
That I'm not weak  
Don't be afraid, I'm not weak  

**[Verse 3: Atif Aslam]**  
Then the night is golden again, asking deep questions from the heart  
Sitting at the door of desires, why bear the weight of hopes?  
The breeze that flows near, knows everything, whispers every time,  
'Don't close these windows, breathe! Don't be afraid of yourself!'  

**[Verse 4: Abdullah Siddiqi]**  
I'm vulnerable, but I'm in my mind  
I don't need you to tell me I'm starry-eyed  
I don't want to hold back if I can't break  
I don't want to shut down just to feel safe  
I'm pathetic, so frenetically romanticizing  
But there's just something so poetic in the clutter  
You can't wear me down  
Oh, you can't wear me down  

**[Chorus: Atif Aslam & Abdullah Siddiqi]**  
Go! 'Cause I never take it slow  
Here I am, I come every day  
I knew it from the get-go  
That I'm not weak  
Don't be afraid, I'm not weak  

**[Bridge: Abdullah Siddiqi]**  
Like the sun on my skin  
Let the heat sink in  
Patterns in my delicate scars  
Feel it in my sunburnt heart  
Healing, while I revel in pain  
Meaning, in the burns, like paint  
Patterns in my delicate scars  
Feel it in my sunburnt heart  
Patterns in my delicate scars  

**[Interlude: Atif Aslam & Abdullah Siddiqi]**  
The heart knows or doesn't know, what are these half-truths?  
I'm used to the paths I've walked, I've arrived there  
The heart knows or doesn't know, what are these half-truths?  
I'm used to the paths I've walked, I've arrived there  
The heart knows or doesn't know, what are these half-truths?  
I'm used to the paths I've walked, I've arrived there  
The heart knows or doesn't know, what are these half-truths?  
I'm used to the paths I've walked, I've arrived there  

**[Chorus: Atif Aslam & Abdullah Siddiqi]**  
Go! 'Cause I never take it slow  
Here I am, I come every day  
I knew it from the get-go  
That I'm not weak  
Don't be afraid, I'm not weak  
Go! 'Cause I never take it slow  
Here I am, I come every day  
I knew it from the get-go  
That I'm not weak  
Don't be afraid, I'm not weak
