**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  

[Verse 1]  
Keep an eye out, no enemies in sight,  
The game spins while we’re on the phone tonight.  
No looking back, we’re in the zone,  
Many are burning bright, but we hold our own.  
Yeah, it feels like a challenge at dawn,  
Ask around, see where the name is drawn.  
The Jatt’s already set, taking his stand,  
Facing the tricks, we’ve got it all planned.  

[Chorus]  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
(With authority,  
Sitting tight, sitting tight.)  

[Interlude]  
The young man’s swagger is making waves,  
The world speaks up, and time behaves.  
Look at our status, it burns through the chest,  
Without a doubt, we rise above the rest.  

[Verse 2]  
The young man’s swagger is making waves,  
The world speaks up, and time behaves.  
Look at our status, it burns through the chest,  
Without a doubt, we rise above the rest.  
You don’t leave, it’s not just business,  
Fake plates on the car, that’s the witness.  
Never back down when the pressure’s on,  
Yeah, face it boldly, let’s carry on.  
Don’t ask about the spots where we stay,  
One or two copies, we’ll find our way.  
Cooling it down, girl, what a display,  
Crafting our art, come what may.  

[Chorus]  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
(With authority,  
Sitting tight, sitting tight.)
