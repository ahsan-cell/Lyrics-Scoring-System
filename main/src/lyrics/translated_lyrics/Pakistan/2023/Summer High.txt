**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
There’s news of our meeting,  
Love is pouring down like rain.  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live,  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live.

[Verse 2]  
Oh, the clouds are making the atmosphere gloomy,  
You don’t search for me anywhere, my dear.  
Sitting still doesn’t happen,  
In my heart, the rabab plays softly.  
Lights have ignited in my eyes,  
I’ve taken the love’s blessings.  
Right now, it doesn’t let me sleep,  
Right now, it doesn’t let me sleep.

[Chorus]  
There’s news of our meeting,  
Love is pouring down like rain.  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live,  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live.

[Verse 3]  
Your name rises with the moon,  
Thoughts come to me, oh dear.  
Now if I write your name on my heart,  
I’ve inscribed your name deep within.  

[Verse 4]  
The winds won’t touch you,  
I worry, playing my tune for ages.  
This drink doesn’t let me sip,  
This drink doesn’t let me sip.  
There’s news of our meeting,  
Love is pouring down like rain.  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live,  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live.

[Outro]  
There’s news of our meeting,  
Love is pouring down like rain.  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live,  
Right now, it doesn’t let me live.
