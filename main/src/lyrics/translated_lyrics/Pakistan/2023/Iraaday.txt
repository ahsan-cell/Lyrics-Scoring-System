**My Intentions**

[Verse 1]  
How do I say there's no one like you?  
There’s no one at all.  
I want to stay close to you,  
But my heart feels desolate.  
All my emotions,  
Only you know.  
No matter how much I look,  
My heart can’t get enough.

[Chorus]  
What a moment this is,  
You and I are here.  
What should I reveal about  
My intentions?  
In your name,  
For some reason,  
What should I reveal about  
My intentions?  
My, my intentions.

[Verse 2]  
I want to hum like this,  
Just for you.  
I wish your gaze  
Would stay with me.  
How can I say,  
How can I express  
The effect you have  
On my heart?  

[Chorus]  
What a moment this is,  
You and I are here.  
What should I reveal about  
My intentions?  
In your name,  
For some reason,  
What should I reveal about  
My intentions?  
My, my, my intentions.
