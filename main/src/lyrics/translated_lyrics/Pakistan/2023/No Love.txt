**Translated Lyrics:**

In your eyes, there's dark kohl  
The beauty of a peacock, oh dear  
A mask on your face, it's all a lie  
But you still charm me, my dear  
How many have come behind you?  
And how many have gone away?  
Counting the hearts you break,  
Like stars that fall away.  

[Chorus]  
There’s no trust left now, my beautiful one  
There’s no trust left now  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore.  

[Post-Chorus]  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore.  

[Verse 1]  
Your hair is like a net,  
A divine punishment, it seems.  
Your eyes are uncontrollable,  
They’re like poison in dreams.  
I only ask one thing from God,  
For your well-being, it beams.  
What was our fault, I wonder,  
When you turned into a fiend?  

[Chorus]  
You’ve done wrong without measure, my beautiful one  
You’ve done wrong without measure  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore.  

[Post-Chorus]  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore.  

[Verse 2]  
Oh, your color shines like light,  
In the dark night of my heart.  
Just a little black dot,  
That’s where the trouble starts.  
You act like you’re innocent,  
But you wanted to be a part.  
Come, let’s write our fate,  
With your magic, let’s restart.  

[Chorus]  
It breaks in the middle, my beautiful one  
It breaks in the middle  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore.  

[Post-Chorus]  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore.
