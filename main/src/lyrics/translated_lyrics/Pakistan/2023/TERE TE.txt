**Translated Lyrics:**

Without you, every moment is tough, my love  
You weave yourself into my thoughts  
Come, solve my troubles, my dear  
Oh, on your face  

Your eyes shine like pearls,  
And the charm of your youth captivates me.  
Those who dare to challenge you,  
They’re just boys in your presence.  

The moonlight has been overshadowed by your beauty,  
Your gaze casts a spell on everyone around.  
In the game of love, they get lost in the thrill,  
Many feet pass by, but they don’t linger here.  

Come, let’s dance again,  
Oh, the charm of your youth.  
Those who dare to challenge you,  
They’re just boys in your presence.  

What you seek, you won’t find in these people,  
Neither of us can catch our breath.  
You’ve become the destination, and the path is hard,  
I’ll bring everything I have just to win you over.  

Everyone talks about love,  
Saying they’ll give you the stars.  
Everyone desires you, feeling helpless,  
But not everyone can handle your allure.  
Oh, the charm of your youth.  

Those who dare to challenge you,  
They’re just boys in your presence.
