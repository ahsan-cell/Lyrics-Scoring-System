**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
My ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Oh, my ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Got a .32 under it (black-black car)  

**[Verse 1]**  
My ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Sitting in the car with my friends who are like family  
They’re big shots causing trouble, taking lives  
We sit back, they don’t let anyone rise  
Don’t take a minute to laugh, tell me what’s bothering you  
What’s bothering me, just tell me, my friend  
The police don’t come into our matters, my friend  
What’s bothering you, just tell me, my friend  
Jatts don’t form gangs, they run with their crew  
Weapons are kept close, ready to go  
Wherever we go, we create a full wave  
Only those with guts stand by us  
Days pass quickly, tell me how many days have gone  
How many times have you counted, don’t count them, my friend  
When trouble comes, we deal with it, my friend  
It doesn’t take long to open up, my friend  
You know, there are many issues with the boys  
Black-tinted windows in this black car of mine  
I go out knowing that whenever I step out, I’m ready  
Let’s play the game, Jatt style, right from the start  
Trouble arises, but we’re the sons of the soil (City)  
In your city, they always ask for our name  
Your friend isn’t moving up top  
He’s standing strong with his crew  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, my ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Got a .32 under it (black-black car)  
My ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Got a .32 under it, it's a black car  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
(black-black car)  
(black-black car)  

**[Verse 2]**  
They roam around your city like they own it  
Wherever they step, they leave a mark of enemies  
Enemies are caught up in the thrill, son of a Jatt  
Your thoughts are lower, my friend, keep your ride clean  
The ride shines bright, the rims sparkle  
In the center, a scarf is visible, flowing  
They walk with pride, thinking of their father  
We hit hard, never wasting time  
They lift each other up, they lift each other up  
Girl, keep your eyes red, read the signs  
Then doubts arise if someone betrays  
With us, son, there’s friendship and rivalry both  
They act tough when they come, but we rise above  
How many birds can fly high and be caught?  
Like peacocks, they dance, work hard or go home  
No one sits on the seat, no girl is resting here  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, my ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Got a .32 under it (black-black car)  
My ride's got a .32 under it, it's a black car  
Got a .32 under it, it's a black car  

**[Outro]**  
(black-black car)  
(black-black car)
