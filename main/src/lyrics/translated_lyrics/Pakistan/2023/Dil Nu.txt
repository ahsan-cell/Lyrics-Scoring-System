**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: AP Dhillon]**  
You're right here,  
Yet I feel you're far away.  
Why do I think like this?  
There must be something to say.  
Just ask me and tell me,  
Is this true or not?  
To my heart.

**[Refrain: AP Dhillon]**  
Hey, tell me at night,  
Why can't I find sleep?  
Are you okay or not?  
My mind is in a heap.  
Why do you care so much?  
Don't deceive my heart,  
To my heart.

**[Verse 1: AP Dhillon]**  
What sin have I committed?  
Just listen to my state.  
Why did you give shelter  
To my wandering heart?  
Why do you care so much?  
Don't deceive my heart,  
To my heart.

**[Chorus: AP Dhillon]**  
You're right here,  
Yet I feel you're far away.  
Why do I think like this?  
There must be something to say.  
Just ask me and tell me,  
Is this true or not?  
To my heart.

**[Verse 2: Shinda Kahlon]**  
The thought of being apart from you,  
I can't even bear.  
I won't share my thoughts,  
Only what feels fair.  
When you asked me questions,  
I felt like I was lost.  
You became my world,  
Keep my heart at any cost.  
In these talks, don’t get lost,  
Now what should I explain?  
How can I forget the moments  
That passed through the pain?  
Don’t care so much,  
Don’t deceive my heart,  
To my heart.

**[Chorus: Shinda Kahlon]**  
You're right here,  
Yet I feel you're far away.  
Why do I think like this?  
There must be something to say.  
Just ask me and tell me,  
Is this true or not?  
To my heart.

**[Verse 7: AP Dhillon]**  
You didn’t believe my words,  
Our love lost its hue.  
Clouds came in,  
Loneliness grew.  
The ground isn’t in the air,  
We were left alone,  
Taking our sorrows with us,  
Becoming old on our own.  
Stay quiet over there,  
Don’t hold anyone’s hand,  
Just don’t let memories  
Slip through like sand.

**[Chorus: AP Dhillon]**  
Hey, you're right here,  
Yet I feel you're far away.  
Why do I think like this?  
There must be something to say.  
Just ask me and tell me,  
Is this true or not?  
To your heart.

**[Refrain: AP Dhillon]**  
Tell me at night,  
Why can't I find sleep?  
Are you okay or not?  
My mind is in a heap.  
Why do you care so much?  
Don't deceive my heart,  
To my heart.

**[Outro]**  
(Why do I think like this?)
