**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
In the talks, my name is like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending down to pretend.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  
In the talks, my name is like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending down to pretend.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  

[Verse 1]  
The city’s breeze is now on our side,  
Today it’s ours, who knows about tomorrow’s ride?  
If things change, it’s no big deal,  
Life keeps moving, that’s just how we feel.  
It flows, speeds up, and keeps the pace,  
Songs play on repeat in this space.  
Heat leaves bodies as they sway,  
Heads nodding like they’re neat in every way.  
Those who get caught, they can’t escape,  
With a glance, they shine like the moon’s shape.  
This year brings a new vibe,  
God bless us, we don’t need to bribe.  

[Chorus]  
In the talks, my name is like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending down to pretend.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  

[Verse 2]  
This world is all about friends’ rise,  
Don’t let doubts hold you back, cut those ties.  
I said, stop playing games, let’s be real,  
Keep it cool, let the true vibes reveal.  
Polite words are just part of the ride,  
Work hard, reach the peak with pride.  
Without any fuss, if someone leaks,  
We fix it up, that’s how our crew speaks.  
With open hearts, we take on the day,  
Filling the air with joy, come what may.  
With us, there’s no dead end in sight,  
We keep moving forward, shining bright.  

[Chorus]  
In the talks, my name is like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending down to pretend.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  
In the talks, my name is like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending down to pretend.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.
