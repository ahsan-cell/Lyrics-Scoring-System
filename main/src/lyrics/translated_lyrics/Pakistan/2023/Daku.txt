**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Winter in the distant valley is like a prayer's echo,  
How can I forget a great storm?  
Oh my love, if beautiful dreams end this way,  
Please hold on to the last moment.  
Love will soon be like an unfinished dream.

**[Verse 2: Anh Khang]**  
My life is like a lullaby at dawn's rosy light,  
How can I keep my eyelids from welling with tears?  
Who remembers the happiness of two hearts?  
Please keep the wings of a bird from afar.  
Oh dear, don’t deceive me and break my heart.

**[Chorus: Bằng Kiều & Anh Khang]**  
The path of clouds now lacks the footprints of paradise,  
Where can I find a wild garden that reveals burning dreams?  
In this new life, do you feel joy?  
Please hold on to a falling leaf.  
Time now will drift like a sailing boat.

Please keep the wings of a bird from afar.  
Oh dear, don’t deceive me and break my heart.
