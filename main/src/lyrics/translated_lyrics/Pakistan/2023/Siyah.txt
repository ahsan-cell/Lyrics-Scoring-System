**Translated Lyrics:**

Who am I to wear this cloak,  
Who am I to bear this burden?  

This story of mine,  
I keep writing on.  

No one is here to listen,  
Words are few,  
Yet there are many tales.  

[HOOK]  
I feel lost somehow,  
Why does nothing please my heart?  
Every color appears to be black.  

[VERSE 2]  
What kind of atmosphere is this,  
A fearless world?  
In my heart lies the fear of God.  

Though my desires were grand,  
All intentions remain unfulfilled.  

[BRIDGE]  
In every hour,  
Silence reigns here.  

Who am I,  
What is my identity?  

[HOOK]  
I feel lost somehow,  
Why does nothing please my heart?  
Every color appears to be black.  

[OUTRO]  
Day by day, it keeps growing,  
This sight of oblivion.  
Every color appears to be black.
