**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Someone tell me this much,  
How can one not fall for you?

[Pre-Chorus]  
God has crafted you,  
Filling beauty's vaults with emptiness.  
With the ink of kohl,  
You've written countless love stories.

[Chorus]  
Your love is saffron, my dear,  
I would be colored if I touch you.  
All day I worry about you,  
All night I pray for your well-being.  
Your love is saffron, my dear,  
I would be colored if I touch you.  
All day I worry about you,  
All night I pray for your well-being.

[Verse 2]  
Even in the autumn season, like colorful chinars,  
In the silence, you're like the strings of a veena.  
Hm, this new moon of the heart lasts longer than centuries,  
And you are like the festivals of fireworks.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The moon is also crazy for you,  
All the chakor birds burn for you.  
With the ink of kohl,  
You've written countless love stories.

[Chorus]  
Your love is saffron, my dear,  
I would be colored if I touch you.  
All day I worry about you,  
All night I pray for your well-being.  
Your love is saffron, my dear,  
I would be colored if I touch you.  
All day I worry about you,  
All night I pray for your well-being.

[Outro]  
Your love is saffron, my dear, love, my dear.  
Your love is saffron, my dear, love, my dear.  
Love, my dear, love, my dear.  
Your saffron (love, my dear, love, my dear, love, my dear)  
Love, my dear (love, my dear, love, my dear, love, my dear)  
I would be colored if I (love, my dear, love, my dear, love, my dear)  
Touch you (love, my dear, love, my dear, love, my dear)  
(love, my dear, love, my dear, love, my dear)  
(love, my dear, love, my dear, love, my dear)
