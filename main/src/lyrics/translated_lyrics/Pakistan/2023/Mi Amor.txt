**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh beloved, you’ve made me fall for you, there’s no need for anyone else  
With your laughter, you strike like a bolt of lightning  
Just tell me, why do you keep dragging this out?  
Oh handsome one, what spell have you cast?  
Oh truly, God has created you with such beauty  
When did you bring me into your love?  
Those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with my heart, with your hair flowing  
Oh, you’re completely captivating, my lovely one

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with my heart, with your hair flowing  
Oh, you’re completely captivating, my lovely one

Oh, you come after me every day  
Oh, I’m drawn to you like a moth to a flame  
Oh, when you pull me close, it’s love that ensnares me  
How can I win with just a glance from your eyes?

Oh darling, because of you, I’ve lost my senses  
Oh, the one who used to point fingers is now running away  
I’ve tried to forget you, but all my efforts fail, my fair one

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with my heart, with your hair flowing  
Oh, you’re completely captivating, my lovely one

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with my heart, with your hair flowing  
Oh, you’re completely captivating, my lovely one

Oh, it’s a mix of emotions, and it tells a story  
Oh, my heart wants to gaze at you again and again  
Don’t ever go far from this thought, my dear  
I keep you hidden deep within my heart

In the letters to friends, it’s only you I mention  
Honestly, I care more about you than myself  
The one who plays the music, oh, they’re not worth it  
I lose when I’m away from you, my fair one

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with my heart, with your hair flowing  
Oh, you’re completely captivating, my lovely one

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with my heart, with your hair flowing  
Oh, you’re completely captivating, my lovely one
