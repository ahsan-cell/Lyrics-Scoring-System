**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Oh, my beloved, my dear, oh  
Look into my eyes, hear my heart's call  
Oh, my beloved, my dear, oh  
Hold me in your arms, don’t let me go anywhere  

[Verse 1]  
Breath by breath, we fill our lives with your name  
We live for you and die in your name  
Breath by breath, we fill our lives with your name  
We live for you and die in your name...  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Darling, don’t misunderstand, my heart says  
It only resides in your streets  
Darling, don’t misunderstand, my heart says  
I want to live and die in your love  

[Chorus]  
Oh, my beloved, my dear, oh  
Look into my eyes, hear my heart's call  
Oh, my beloved, my dear, oh  
Hold me in your arms, don’t let me go anywhere  

[Verse 2]  
These games of love, I’ve played them all  
Even giving my heart, I spent these nights alone  
I’m tangled up in you, my darling  
Otherwise, I’ve solved one riddle after another  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Darling, don’t misunderstand, we are afraid  
To see you from afar, we cherish the sight  
Darling, don’t misunderstand, we are afraid  
We love you, living and dying in your love  

[Chorus]  
Oh, my beloved, my dear, oh  
Look into my eyes, hear my heart's call  
Oh, my beloved, my dear, oh  
Hold me in your arms, don’t let me go anywhere
