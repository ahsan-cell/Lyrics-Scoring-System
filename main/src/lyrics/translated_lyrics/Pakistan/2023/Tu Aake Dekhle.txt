**Translated Lyrics:**

Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  

[Verse 1]  
People say I'm unfortunate  
Ask them why I'm defeated?  
When love didn't come my way, I turned my heart into a name  
This carefree wanderer  
How does he keep living?  
Look into my fearless eyes, see the Taj being built  
But in front of you, nothing matters, it's all just ashes  
I'll get lost, so talk to me when we meet  
But in front of you, nothing matters, it's all just ashes  
I'll get lost, so talk to me when we meet  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Because you fit perfectly in my eyes  
And nothing else stands before you  
The people of this world  
Don't point out my flaws  
I'll take all your mistakes upon myself  
And these distances will vanish  
New journeys will begin  
Hey hey hey, Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  

[Chorus]  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  

[Verse 2]  
People say I'm wrong  
I hold onto your longing  
But what can I do? Seeing your pictures ignites my desire  
I can't stop myself  
Tears just flow  
I'm not one to love anyone else, keeping names apart  
Just talk to me when we meet  
Take care not to hurt my heart a little  
Just talk to me when we meet  
Take care not to hurt my heart a little  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Because you inhabit my memories  
And no one else feels good to me  
The people of this world  
Don't point out my flaws  
I'll take all your mistakes upon myself  
And these distances will vanish  
New journeys will begin  
Hey hey hey, Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  

[Chorus]  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love
