**Translated Lyrics:**

Listen to the story, yes, hear it from me  
I fell in love, I made my confession  
Listen to the story, yes, hear it from me  
I fell in love, I made my confession  
I fell in love, I made my confession  

[Verse 1]  
I became crazy, I became intoxicated  
How many tales were spun in your love  
The fragrance of your arrival, the scene of your departure  
I must meet you, now it's time  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Hear the calls, yes, hear the pains  

[Chorus]  
I fell in love, I made my confession  
I fell in love, I made my confession  

[Bridge]  
We long to make you our bride  
To adorn your hands with henna bearing our name  
Let’s take your blessings, let’s remove our troubles  
We long to make you ours  

[Verse 2]  
Loyalty isn’t hard, just look around here  
My world resides in your eyes  
Sometimes listen to what I couldn’t say  
You are my universe  
You are my hope  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Hear the prayers, hear the punishments  

[Chorus]  
I fell in love, I made my confession  
Listen to the story, yes, hear it from me  
I fell in love, I made my confession  
I fell in love, I made my confession  

[Outro]  
I fell in love  
I fell in love  
I fell in love
