**Translated Lyrics: "Intense"**

[Chorus: AP Dhillon]  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, that’s when I’ll know  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, then—

[Verse 1: AP Dhillon]  
What’s the use of mending a broken heart, dear?  
Twelve years spent in the shadows, left behind the throne, my dear  
Every moment, I remember you  
If someone treats us like this, then I’ll know

[Chorus: AP Dhillon]  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, that’s when I’ll know  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, then—  

[Verse 2: Gurinder Gill]  
She used to say, “Make a path to the moon”  
“I love all the stars that shine below”  
When she sees me among those stars  
When my memory comes back, then I’ll know  

[Chorus: Gurinder Gill & AP Dhillon]  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, that’s when I’ll know  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, then I’ll know  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, then—  

[Verse 3: AP Dhillon]  
You didn’t fit in the palace I built for you  
I brought flowers and pearls into that palace  
Just like you left us, oh beloved  
When someone leaves you, then—  
Oh, just like you left us, oh beloved  
When someone leaves you, then I’ll know  

[Chorus: AP Dhillon]  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, that’s when I’ll know  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, then I’ll know  

[Verse 4: Gurinder Gill]  
We got lost on the path of love  
People mocked me, but I smiled through it  
We got lost on the path of love  
People mocked me, but I smiled through it  
You kept trampling on our love  
When emotions rule, then I’ll know  

[Chorus: Gurinder Gill]  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, that’s when I’ll know  
You fight with my heart, oh beloved  
When your heart breaks, then I’ll know
