**Translated Lyrics:**

This humility of mine  
Even today, I  
Stay right here  
The longing for you  
Has begun to take shape  
In my senses  
It doesn’t remain  
I don’t know why it’s only you  
Who resides in my heart  
What do I live for without you?  
This scattered heart, what a torment  
You have caused me  
Yet I say nothing  
Just tell me, what is this affliction?  
In the hunt of my gaze  
You surely know well  
Everything is in your control  
Know this  
Even if everything changes  
I will remain  
Right here, just like this  
I don’t know why it’s only you  
Who resides in my heart  
What do I live for without you?  
This scattered heart, what a torment  
You have caused me  
Yet I say nothing  
I don’t know why it’s only you  
Who resides in my heart  
What do I live for without you?  
This scattered heart, what a torment  
You have caused me  
Yet I say nothing  
I don’t know why  
You are in my heart, why?  
I don’t know why  
It’s only you  
I don’t know why  
Hmmmm  
Yet I say nothing.
