**Translated Lyrics:**

Things adorned that are the beauty of the night  
On one side sand, on the other side a spark of light  
Underneath the hoods, faces don’t reveal  
Lowkey people, with secret thoughts concealed  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
With the one who walks the path of danger  

**[Chorus]**  
On dark nights  
The car moves slow  
With the bass thumping  
They put on a show  

**[Verse 2]**  
They’re lurking, vibing to the trap beat  
Our crew doesn’t need a map to find the heat  
No direct call, the number’s on tap  
If you want to connect, just hit me on Snap  
With dealers and plugs, we rise and fall  
In reality, this vibe won’t stall  
Playing the game, hunting for the score  
Don’t ask about the source, it’s a shady lore  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Like the flow of cash, it’s all in the glow  

**[Chorus]**  
On dark nights  
The car moves slow  
With the bass thumping  
They put on a show  
(On dark nights  
The car moves slow  
With the bass thumping  
They put on a show)  

**[Verse 3]**  
With light steps, the action unfolds  
Not knowing where the gang comes from, truth be told  
Ferragamo eyes, red like a flame  
Staying high all day, playing the game  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
See the glow shining from their faces  

**[Chorus]**  
On dark nights  
The car moves slow  
With the bass thumping  
They put on a show  
(On dark nights  
The car moves slow  
With the bass thumping  
They put on a show)
