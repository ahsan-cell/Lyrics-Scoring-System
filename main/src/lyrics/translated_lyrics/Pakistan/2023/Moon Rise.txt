**Translated Lyrics:**

The light has gone out,  
Now your memory has come back,  
You’ve read my heart,  
Without you, I’m destined to die.

[Verse 1]  
Oh, how many hearts have been broken,  
Yours too, as you leave,  
Take this excuse,  
And fulfill your desire.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, the pain of separation,  
It eats away at me from within.

[Chorus]  
The light has gone out,  
Now your memory has come back,  
You’ve read my heart,  
Without you, I’m destined to die.

[Verse 2]  
Oh, like stars in the sky,  
All are the stars in your embrace,  
I would bring the moon beneath you,  
Oh, all lovers are yours.  
Oh, like stars in the sky,  
All are the stars in your embrace,  
I would bring the moon beneath you,  
Oh, all lovers are yours.

[Pre-Chorus]  
If you smile just once,  
All my sorrows will vanish.

[Chorus]  
The light has gone out,  
Now your memory has come back,  
You’ve read my heart,  
Without you, I’m destined to die.

[Verse 3]  
Oh, for someone with good fortune,  
In their fate, you will be,  
Oh, what a memory it is,  
In that memory, you will be lost.  
Oh, for someone with good fortune,  
In their fate, you will be,  
Oh, what a memory it is,  
In that memory, you will be lost.

[Pre-Chorus]  
When you shy away,  
How many hearts are left behind?

[Chorus]  
The light has gone out,  
Now your memory has come back,  
You’ve read my heart,  
Without you, I’m destined to die.
