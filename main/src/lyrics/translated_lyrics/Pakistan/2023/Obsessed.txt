**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Riar Saab]  
Ayy, ayy  

[Chorus: Riar Saab]  
Oh, you keep your rides high (Ayy)  
Oh, many girls are after the Jatt  
But you look good with me (look good with me)  
Oh, you wear a Gucci belt on your waist  
The Jatts have a new kurta on display  
Our style is something else entirely  
(Our style is something else entirely)  
Oh, you keep your rides high (Ayy)  
Oh, many girls are after the Jatt  
But you look good with me (look good with me)  
Oh, you wear a Gucci belt on your waist  
The Jatts have a new kurta on display  
Our style is something else entirely  
(Our style is something else entirely)  

[Verse 1: Riar Saab]  
You’re my peaceful place, songs about you just keep coming  
I hide you away so that no one can see our love  
The world is beautiful, but you make it a different realm  
Loyalty and care for each other, a little anger is justified  

[Verse 2: Abhijay Sharma]  
Darling, come meet me, your teasing drives me wild  
Your addiction has ruined me  
The world will write about you, my life  

[Bridge: Abhijay Sharma]  
Talking to you feels like magic  
There’s been a change because of you  
I’ve even kept my mustache styled  
Oh, they say it’s all because of you, darling  
Talking to you feels like magic  
There’s been a change because of you (Ayy, ayy)  
I’ve even kept my mustache styled  
Oh, they say it’s all because of you, darling  

[Chorus: Riar Saab]  
Oh, you keep your rides high (Ayy)  
Oh, many girls are after the Jatt  
But you look good with me (look good with me)  
Oh, you wear a Gucci belt on your waist  
The Jatts have a new kurta on display  
Our style is something else entirely  
(Our style is something else entirely)  
Oh, you keep your rides high (Ayy)  
Oh, many girls are after the Jatt  
But you look good with me (look good with me)  
Oh, you wear a Gucci belt on your waist  
The Jatts have a new kurta on display  
Our style is something else entirely  
(Our style is something else entirely)  

[Verse 3: Riar Saab]  
The weather may change, but your love for me remains constant  
When I look into your eyes, I see tears in yours  
You say my gaze makes you feel special  
I pray for you, even if you forget me  

[Verse 4: Abhijay Sharma]  
Where does my heart belong without you here?  
This path is unknown, but you hold my address  

[Chorus: Riar Saab]  
Oh, you keep your rides high (Ayy)  
Oh, many girls are after the Jatt  
But you look good with me (look good with me)  
Oh, you wear a Gucci belt on your waist  
The Jatts have a new kurta on display  
Our style is something else entirely  
(Our style is something else entirely)  
Oh, you keep your rides high (Ayy)  
Oh, many girls are after the Jatt  
But you look good with me (look good with me)  
Oh, you wear a Gucci belt on your waist  
The Jatts have a new kurta on display  
Our style is something else entirely  
(Our style is something else entirely)  

[Outro: Riar Saab]  
You look good with me
