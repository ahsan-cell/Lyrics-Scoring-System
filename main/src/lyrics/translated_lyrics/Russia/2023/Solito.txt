**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
From my eyes I sing  
I sing because you haven't come  
I'm all alone in Las Palmas  
Changing who I am  

**[Verse]**  
Yeah, yeah  
I tell you it's done  
You don't love me  
I've had enough  
If you've got a body, you can move it back for me  
When it passes, they don't breathe like asthma  
I wish, you won't call me  
On the street with the guys from the mafia  
Double iron eclipsed with my soul  
Yeah, yeah  
I tell you it's done  
You don't love me  
I've had enough  
If you've got a body, you can move it back for me  
When it passes, they don't breathe like asthma  
I wish, you won't call me  
On the street with the guys from the mafia  
Double iron eclipsed with my soul  

**[Chorus]**  
From my eyes I sing (From my eyes I sing)  
I sing because you haven't come (I sing because you haven't come)  
I'm all alone in Las Palmas  
Changing who I am  
Come on  
From my eyes I sing (From my eyes I sing)  
I sing because you haven't come (I sing because you haven't come)  
I'm all alone in Las Palmas  
Changing who I am
