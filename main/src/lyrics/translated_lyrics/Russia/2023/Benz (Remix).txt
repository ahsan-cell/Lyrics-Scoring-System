**[Intro]**  
Snowy mountains, what do you want to eat?

**[Chorus: C.R.O & Duki]**  
I popped another Moët, my girl’s dressed in Chanel  
We’re feeling fresh, we’re doing well, stacks of hundred dollar bills  
Now that we’re on the rise, we have a different perspective  
I’m with Duko and everyone’s watching; the girls love us, the guys don’t throw shade  
I popped another Moët, smoking and recording in the hotel suite (Wuh)  
They want to give me love but can’t see me; it’s no longer top five, now it’s top three  
Now that we’re on the rise, everyone wants us in their lives  
I’m with C.R.O and they’re watching us (Duko, you know)

**[Verse 1: Duki]**  
Smoking cheese, cheesy, they’re rats, Mickey  
They’re infected with hepatitis, I hear their tracks and get an ear infection  
My life’s a curve, drifting; I’m feeling brand new, lifting  
Before heading out, the fitting, I cross paths with you on fifteen  
I die on stage  
In a harakiri dressed in AMIRI  
Their future is dark, the color of my iris  
If I’m with C.R.O in the studio, the tracks come out bigger than a remix  
Go and warn them, let them know, tell them  
That I’m on my grind stacking up the thousands  
Let the fools throw shade, let them comment, let them watch  
Because around here, the kids are living it up  
My waves of flow leave you twenty meters underwater talking to dolphins  
I make them retire and come back so many times to the music they need a Guinness  
I’ve got them hooked, drug dealer  
You won’t see this movie in theaters  
What I do in a year, I do in a weekend  
My brother brought missiles

**[Verse 2: C.R.O]**  
We were down, now we’re at the top (Oh)  
Designer clothes made to my measure (Yeah-ah)  
I’m with my brother playing in the big leagues  
Money awaits me if I land in Argentina  
Money keeps me awake, I earn money and invest it  
Expert negotiator, if it’s not about money, I don’t understand  
Follow, okay (Yeah), my chain shines (Yeah)  
Another champagne (Yeah), where’s my Moët?  
I’m going to drink another Moët, I’m going to buy a Mercedes Benz  
I’m going to spend another hundred, I’m going to smoke in Calvin Klein  
I’m going to dominate this damn game, I don’t mind being first  
I’m going to buy a new bag just to hold money

**[Chorus: C.R.O & Duki]**  
I popped another Moët (Moët), my girl’s dressed in Chanel  
We’re feeling fresh, we’re doing well, stacks of hundred dollar bills  
Now that we’re on the rise, we have a different perspective  
I’m with Duko and everyone’s watching; the girls love us, the guys don’t throw shade  
I popped another Moët, smoking and recording in the hotel suite (Wuh)  
They want to give me love but can’t see me; it’s no longer top five, now it’s top three  
Now that we’re on the rise, everyone wants us in their lives  
I’m with C.R.O and they’re watching us

**[Outro: Duki]**  
Smoking cheese, cheesy
