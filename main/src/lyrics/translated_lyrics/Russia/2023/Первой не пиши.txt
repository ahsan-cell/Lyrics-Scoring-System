**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Leos]  
Don’t be the first to write to him, and don’t rush to forgive his pain.  
Kill all your feelings and suffocate them, take a step away from him.  
Don’t be the first to write to him, and don’t rush to forgive his pain.  
Kill all your feelings and suffocate them, take a step away from him.  

[Verse 1: Idris]  
I know you feel lonely at night,  
It’s already Saturday, and he’s still silent.  
Maybe he has his reasons for that,  
You comfort yourself with empty hopes again.  
You’ll post a beautiful story, let him see  
What he’s losing, while you’ll be strong,  
Out of spite for all the hurts he caused you once.  
If only he could love like you do,  
You’d be among the stars.  
But not everyone is meant for that (not everyone is meant for that).  
Though you’re not in a movie with him, (not in a movie)  
Your love is quite the drama.  
It will be hard, but remember the main thing.  

[Chorus: Leos]  
Don’t be the first to write to him, and don’t rush to forgive his pain.  
Kill all your feelings and suffocate them, take a step away from him.  
Don’t be the first to write to him, and don’t rush to forgive his pain.  
Kill all your feelings and suffocate them, take a step away from him.  

[Verse 2: Leos]  
Darling, believe me, he will pay for all the hurts.  
It just takes time, and he’ll crawl back on his knees.  
But it will be too late, and he probably won’t understand that.  
You’ll find happiness one day,  
You’ll find happiness, but not with him.  

[Chorus: Leos]  
Don’t be the first to write to him, and don’t rush to forgive his pain.  
Kill all your feelings and suffocate them, take a step away from him.  
Don’t be the first to write to him, and don’t rush to forgive his pain.  
Kill all your feelings and suffocate them, take a step away from him.
