**[Chorus]**  
This girl from the magazine (She's on me)  
She smiles at me so brightly (Right on me)  
Oh God, how I love this feeling (Whoa, yeah-yeah)  
I'll take her right in the dance (Ooh)  
This girl from the magazine (She's on me)  
She smiles at me so brightly (Right on me)  
Oh God, how I love this feeling (Whoa, yeah-yeah)  
I'll take her right in the dance (Ooh-ooh)  

**[Verse]**  
Breathe in, breathe out  
Beauty, take a step, I see it all ahead  
I need your soul, I don’t want anyone else  
I want to see you, I’m done with the others  
They’re spinning my head around  
They think I’ve lost my mind  
I love to remember girls like you  
But by the way, yes, now you  
Believed in my dreams, but not like before  
Everything that was is just dreams  
But that girl from the magazine smiled at me, not you  
What— What— What are you singing to me? I don’t believe your words  
It’s kind of strange, okay, fine  
Want to know my troubles? Here are my pills  
I don’t mind, it’s even a bit frustrating  
That you’re late, but that girl from the magazine is with me  
And it feels so sweet with her  

**[Chorus]**  
This girl from the magazine (She's on me)  
She smiles at me so brightly (Right on me)  
Oh God, how I love this feeling (Whoa, yeah-yeah)  
I'll take her right in the dance (Ooh)  
This girl from the magazine (She's on me)  
She smiles at me so brightly (Right on me)  
Oh God, how I love this feeling (Whoa, yeah-yeah)  
I'll take her right in the dance (Ooh-ooh)
