**[Intro]**  
Stalin, Stalin, Putin's a fool  
Stalin, Stalin, I hear Putin's last breath  
Stalin, Stalin, Putin's a fool  
Stalin, Stalin, Putin's a fool  
Stalin, Stalin, I hear Putin's last breath  

**[Chorus]**  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  

**[Bridge]**  
I'm like Stalin, all the madness is free  
I never made a mistake  
I'm like Stalin, the Nazi's been crushed  

**[Chorus]**  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  

**[Verse]**  
I have crystals, we took them from the Nazis, bastards  
Not a step back, I'll shoot you all  
Your cheap plane's ordered from Ali  
Hey, the enemy's already dead, if you can't see it, you're dead too  
I see Hitler taking his last breath  
Because of me, even your carpet dries faster  
Fuck Putin, fuck Putin, I'm tired of doing all the routine, but I'm really good, I'll always help you  
Putin's a faggot, come to us  
You live where all the trash turned into a hurricane  
I see you all, the whole country, why aren't you happy to see me, since I'm walking on the table, just like Nazarbayev in Astana  
I don't need fame, I don't need money  
I need victory, you run from us like squirrels  
We turn you into dough, you are squirrels  
Putin's a faggot, he doesn't see the drug warehouses right under his nose  
And we don't have that  
No matter how hard you try, you won't find those traces  
I've walked among people like you  
You're worth five rubles, alas  
I have hundreds like you in my closet  
Run, boy, run  

**[Chorus]**  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  

**[Chorus 2]**  
What are you doing, Putin, what are you doing, Putin  
What are you doing, Putin, what are you doing, you fool  
Stop doing bullshit, take care of yourself instead  
In every speech, you talk like a lunatic and a fool  
Wait, wait, wait  
Putin's empty, wait, wait  
Empty, wait, wait, wait  
What are you doing, Putin, what are you doing, Putin  
What are you doing, Putin, what are you doing, you fool  
Stop doing bullshit, take care of yourself instead  
In every speech, you talk like a lunatic and a fool  
Wait, wait, wait  
Putin's empty, wait, wait  
Empty, wait, wait, wait  

**[Verse 2]**  
So why the hell are you needed in this world?  
You're only needed at the shooting range  
Look around even in your own apartment  
You screwed up, damn it  
How can you bear responsibility for Russia?  
You fat pig, eat my mustache like a cake  
Faggot, suck my ass like a croissant  
Admit it, you knew about your extra weight, hey  
Over there, do you see the forest burning?  
It's all because of you, what a mess  
I'll destroy you, call me father  
You're a good boy, don't mess with me, fuck your croissant  
Good, I'm real trap, you're soft as bread  
You destroyed the country, I'll improve it, I'll resurrect myself  
Shut your mouth, my milk right in your face  
I spin dirt, and you've never smoked it  
You haven't even smoked shit  
But I have plenty of it  

**[Chorus]**  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  
Shoot the bastards, shoot the bastards, fuck them  

**[Chorus 2]**  
What are you doing, Putin, what are you doing, Putin  
What are you doing, Putin, what are you doing, you fool  
Stop doing bullshit, take care of yourself instead  
In every speech, you talk like a lunatic and a fool  
Wait, wait,
