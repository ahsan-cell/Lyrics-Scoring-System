**Translated Lyrics:**

My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  

**[Chorus]**  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  

**[Verse 1]**  
Pick up the phone, I have a question  
I’d give you the whole world  
Enough of the fuss and the mess  
Let my cigarette burn out  
It’s not easy for me right now  
And time is slowly melting away  
Our tandem is pure magic  

You’re dancing on the bar with them  
You’re calling me, come on, come on  
You’re only interested in my dollars, euros, dramas, rubles  
And you dance so beautifully on the bar with them, you’re calling me, come on, come on  
You’re calling me, come on, come on, you’re calling me, come on, come on  

**[Chorus]**  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  

**[Verse 2]**  
Loud cries cover the curses  
Whatever she wants, that’s how it goes  
Next to her, everyone’s faceless  
She’s the captain of seven circles of hell  
She disappears and reappears  
I admit, I like it  
She’s a dream and slow poison  
A needle inside me  

Clothes from Paris  
You’re breathing unevenly around me  
You crave the movement  
Your favorite place is somewhere warm  
Love without taxes  
Your February has passed, but I’m in September  
The scent on you is Tom Ford  
And you ordered a “comfort” taxi  

**[Chorus]**  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
My digi-digi-digi-digi shalala  
Baby made in Italia, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la
