**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Brother Two]**  
Fierce underground, I’m throwing up in both ends  
Fireworks and a pump, salty fish on hand  
Advice from Al Capone — finish it with a boot  
A colorblind Chinese loves his flag, that’s the truth  
Sinking, getting wasted to the core  
No one can replace your glowing eyes anymore  
We’re not in America, you’ve been out of luck  
While intentions dug deep into our sides, stuck  
Prickling, floating in the clouds above  
Frame-by-frame waltz, an endless circus of love  
Just like suicide, you’ve learned the words  
Started calling things by their names, absurd  
Singing about poverty and crime, it’s a grind  
Here they’d take cash, leave no trace behind  
I pushed a bike for a fix, feeling quite blind  
Savely’s gone all cross-eyed, lost in the bind  
Yet I sent my regards, drifting far with reverb  
It’s fundamentally wrong, but in the end, it’s observed  
Gave a jolt to the wounded, roots and herbs  
From central to extreme in prime time, we swerve  

**[Verse 2: Mikhail Shorokh]**  
The tent is torn down, heat it up, padre  
For Rus’, for the soul, for the pavilions, hooray  
I’ll explode this day inside and out  
We’ll pass through like mercury, no doubt  
And it’s still dark, smoke and soot all around  
Hunched filth drips vermouth from the ceiling down  
She’ll breathe into the pipe for the cops, Anapa-Saratov  
“Anaphora” in Wikipedia, a writer’s find, oh so soft  
News channels blare, anathema, be gone  
Don’t hide your mug when your bro brings food along  
The air dries from the carcasses, thirsting for more  
Or speedy horses, each with their own shore  
No one can calm the stir of our cheeks  
Regretting what’s left unconsumed, where would you seek?  
On the first last page, it’s written, follow your heart  
On Wednesday and Friday, dance, play your part  
Such is karma, your cold watch feeds the homeless in the dark  
And we’re still drying out, insurance drips like a spark  
Not the right cat on the floor, it’s not cake — you rust in the park.
