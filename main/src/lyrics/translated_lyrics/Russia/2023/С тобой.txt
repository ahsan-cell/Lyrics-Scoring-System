**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Jakone, A.V.G]  
God be with you, where the pain is felt  
When barefoot, when a warrior  
As if free  
When health is present, I am content  
God be with you, where the pain is felt  
When barefoot, when a warrior  
As if free  
When health is present, I am content  

[Verse 1: Jakone]  
Bang-bang, I shoot through the city  
Into Tartarus, I go by the guardrail  
Lockdown doesn’t keep us at home  
We’re the old school, remade anew  
Hit in the head, but you didn’t fall  
Thump-thump-thump, jumped out just in time  
How are you? Like powerless Boeings  
And they don’t take those with armor-piercing rounds  

[Verse 2: A.V.G]  
Unexpectedly, with wounds that are battered  
I’m flying away, but I will return  
The dark side of my hometown  
Will show you where my sadness lies  
I’ve seen a lot, as the road led  
Broken, and from the bottom, they won’t let go  
They’re glad to see me, and I’m glad too, yes  
In the muck up to my elbows, and blood will flow  
You might also like  
[Verse 3: BAGARDI]  
I’m a lyricist by nature  
I’m loyal to every fool  
They call me Bacardi  
I’m racking up debts on the map  
Left-right, here’s the distant light  
The headlights blind my eyes right on target  
The bastards shout, asking: “Send the number”  
I dictate my old SIM  

[Verse 4: Goro]  
I rose and fell  
Friends were scoundrels  
On the road, I found  
My path for the young  
Someone’s beside me  
Someone blew poison  
And we wandered in a herd  
For profit, but is it necessary?  
Without lifting up, we fell  
But we kept our brotherhood  
And we’re judged only by those  
Who got zeros in the game  
Zeros, ah-ah-ah  
Who got zeros in the game (zeros)  

[Verse 5: Asatro]  
(Hey, hey)  
Okay, I close my eyes  
Everything that was said  
I’m changing my path  
For there’s no road back  
What’s up, this is a new law  
Or a new setup?  
Behind the city, I press the gas  
I assure you, family will never betray  
We dug deep  
In rhythm, we then gave  
In the rhythm of dance, we make songs  
So you can enjoy, so you can enjoy  

[Chorus: Jakone, A.V.G]  
God be with you, where the pain is felt  
When barefoot, when a warrior  
As if free  
When health is present, I am content  
God be with you, where the pain is felt  
When barefoot, when a warrior  
As if free  
When health is present, I am content
