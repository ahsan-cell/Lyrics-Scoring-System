**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Masia One]  
Once for the money bag, twice for the show  
A couple of years ago, I ran away, you know  
Cash for check to (?)  
There you go again, marvelous  
Catch me by, my life is a candy ring  
Maybe light my fire, home (?) midnight train  
(?) Spain  
Watch (?)  
() home again  
Back to the beginning  
Recognize the pain, all I do is (?)  

[Chorus: Masia One]  
This is for the summer breeze  
The chance to leave my life as it is  
Always thinking about you  
Love this feeling, so, so special  

This is for the summer breeze  
The chance to leave my life as it is  
Always thinking about you  
Love this feeling, so, so special  

[Verse 2: Elphomega]  
In my house of cilantro and fresh basil  
Days are like cold gazpacho when you appreciate them  
Look at it when you remember the old promises  
Kilometers weigh nothing when they’re counted  
Beginning, end, risk, reward  
New city, new country  
Another experience, no one hears my voice in the wave’s tube  
Hidden in the last car  
Goodbye home, goodbye scent, goodbye sadness  
Today everything starts with skewers and beer, trust and strength  
Each person is their own business, creating their wealth  
They also pay their dues, taking what they deserve and letting time do the rest  
I tear off a leaf and the night tastes like pesto  
Why so many words? When a gesture defines it  
I fly with the breeze, the journey will help me grow  
Don’t rush, savor what it offers you  
Those who go with you  
Will lend you their coat if you share what you catch  
The end is always near, youth is just tinder  
Burning every day, before night falls  
Don’t underestimate it because tomorrow you’ll kill for it  
Don’t regret when it disappears  
I leave with the snows, I’ll return when it blooms  
I didn’t remember how it hurt, if it doesn’t refresh  

[Chorus: Masia One]  
This is for the summer breeze  
The chance to leave my life as it is  
Always thinking about you  
Love this feeling, so, so special  

This is for the summer breeze  
The chance to leave my life as it is  
Always thinking about you  
Love this feeling, so, so special
