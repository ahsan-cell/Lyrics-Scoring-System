**Translated Lyrics:**

(rrrrrghhh)
I’m running from school  
Yeah, I have seven classes today  
At home, Brawlik and a glass of compote are waiting for me  
They offered me Leon in exchange for my mom  
And I’m not talking about PC!  
But I told them - you can take her!  
Now I have a raven and Leon  
And here I am sitting  
In DEDDOM!!! (a play on "grandpa's house" in Russian slang)

**Verse 1 - Reegelon**

- Hey, let’s start over!  
Gucci Mane type beats are out of style  
(How so?)  
These boxers from WB need my butt  
(Grrr!)  
Like immigrants need a Priora (a car model)  
Pigeons crapped on me - looks like it’s Angry Birds!  
I’m shitting myself - Amber Heard  
I’m pixelated - Kingdom Hearts  
Back on the beats like birds  
I haven’t seen a city better than Nice  
Haters, you’re our pigs  
Kievstoner is like Winnie the Pooh  
(Yo!)  
Pooh, I’m a chick 'cause I’m brushing off fluff  
I’m layered like a troll or an onion  
I pull out my arrows and string my bow  

**Bridge - Reegelon**

Boy, tell me this  
How did you download Angry Birds Stella?  
What?  
Pamela downloaded it for you?  
What’s wrong with you - sniffing chalk?  
School, what are you doing to the guys?  
Why does he have a backpack with snacks??!!  
Hey, Kurt Cobain - bring me my Nova  
This is CS:GO MiniGames - Mom, bring me pilaf  
(Please! Please!)

**Verse 2 - Mikita Kyshevsky**

Let’s Go!!!  
I bought myself new Dunks in winter  
(ou, wow, wow, wow)  
When I see Red, I’m standing tall  
(Tall)  
But he’s not that big  
I’m walking through a sleeping neighborhood, businesslike  
I overcooked sausages in the microwave  
And now it’s just not tasty at all  
Yeah, I’m an angel with spirits  
My diamonds, but damn, they’re so dull  
(so dull, so dull, dull)  
Playing lotto, I got an ace, damn  
(What?)  
Eating toffees, there’s a mess  
My backpack is a fucking bullet  
(Shoo-oo)  
We’re driving in the car, it’s morning  
(Ha-Ha-Ha)  
I drank some nasty soda  
(Qje!)  
I’m putting this khinkali on a plate  
I’m a mean little bird, I want coke  
Seventh grader, send me some bucks  
(Send them!)  
Yeah, I’m pooping, but in public  
(Damn!)  
Sitting on the pot - watching cartoons  
Yeah, you’re right, house music is trash  
I exploded from the smell of the bush  

**Verse 3 - Reegelon**

Ko-ko-ko-ko, Ko-ko-ko-ko  
All I hear is just ko-ko  
All I hear is lil' ko-to-to  
Fat bass, like a king pig  
(pig-pig-pig, sweem-sweem-sweem)  
I know English, swimming - sweem  
(Lord of the Rings, fuck real!)  
I’m like John Cena - so where’s my ring?  
The tower of the pig wizard - like ghetto  
I’m fed up with this!  
I once saw a guy named Red  
His name was Ai-ya-ya-Ai-a-ya  
(Terrence!)  
This is DJ Smash type  
Hey, bro - where did you find this?!?

Hey, bro - where did you find this?!?!
