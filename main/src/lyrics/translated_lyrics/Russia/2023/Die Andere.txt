**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: CAPO]  
Uhh

[Part 1: CAPO]  
Hey, Mamacita (Mamacita)  
I’m just a regular boy from the rough side  
It’s all good, Mamacita (Mamacita)  
Don’t worry, I’ll handle this bill myself  
No, we don’t know each other  
Come, I’ll take you on my fantasy trip, baby  
The Ferrari is called Enzo Original  
The city in the hands of the Mainhatten City Gang  
Next stop, Konstablerwache  
Two thousand purple bills are in the briefcase behind  
Robbers celebrate this night, going on the hunt  
Because they know tonight is the first winter night  
Meeting point downtown, Italian restaurant, behind the building is the handover  
You’ve asked me so many times  
Now you know, Barbie, this is my city

[Hook 1: CAPO]  
In my city, it gets dark (It gets dark)  
Here, days pass like seconds (Like seconds)  
Yeah, in my city, it gets dark (Dark)  
The snitches from the drug squad are back to serving customers  
In my city, it gets dark (It gets dark)  
Here, days pass like seconds (Like seconds)  
Yeah, in my city, it gets dark (Dark)  
The snitches from the drug squad are back to serving customers  

[Bridge: CAPO & Nimo]  
No, we don’t know each other  
Come, I’ll take you on my fantasy trip, baby (Come, come, come, come)  
The Ferrari is called Enzo Original  
The city in the hands of the Mainhatten City Gang (Uh-uh-uh-uh)

[Part 2: Nimo]  
Rolling with Chico at night in the Jaguar through FFM, thinking deep (Thinking deep, thinking deep, uh-uh-uh-uh)  
One hand out the window, Ekho, the other on my steering wheel (Steering wheel, ah-ah-ah)  
How dark is my brother’s cell and how’s Z doing? (Z doing, Z doing, uh-uh-uh-uh)  
What rule of law? Screw the state, brother O got six years (Uh-uh-uh-uh)

[Hook 2: Nimo & CAPO]  
Because when it gets dark (When it gets dark)  
You see the difference (You see the difference)  
Criminals among themselves  
Pico, I’ll hunt you down when it gets dark (Pap, pap, pap, pap, brrra)  
Because when it gets dark (When it gets dark)  
You see the difference (You see the difference)  
Criminals among themselves  
Pico, I’ll hunt you down when it gets dark (Pap, pap, pap, pap, brrra)  
In my city, it gets dark (It gets dark)  
Here, days pass like seconds (Like seconds)  
Yeah, in my city, it gets dark (Dark)  
The snitches from the drug squad are back to serving customers  
In my city, it gets dark (It gets dark)  
Here, days pass like seconds (Like seconds)  
Yeah, in my city, it gets dark (Dark)  
The snitches from the drug squad are back to serving customers (Pap, pap, pap, pap, brrra)

[Outro: Nimo]  
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la, brrra)  
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la, brrra)  
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la, brrra)  
La-la-la-la-la-la (Puh), la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la (La-la-la-la, brrra)  
La-la-la-la-la-la (Puh), la-la-la-la (Brrra)
