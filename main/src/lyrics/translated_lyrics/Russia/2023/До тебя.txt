**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
It feels like every morning  
You remember me, call me  
If you need, I’ll fly to you  
It feels like every morning  
You remember me, call me  
If you need, I’ll fly to you  

[Verse 1]  
You left a mark, and now you’re inside me  
Even if I’m not around, I can’t let you go  
You’re sweeter than all those you hated  
They talk about me, but they’re just spectators  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A hundred problems in my head, well, so be it  
Don’t let anyone closer than me  
Our quarrels are on fire, my dear, know  
Wherever I am, I have you  

[Chorus]  
It feels like every morning  
You remember me, call me  
If you need, I’ll fly to you  
It feels like every morning  
You remember me, call me  
If you need, I’ll fly to you  

[Verse 2]  
We share the dawn through the screen  
Like a ram against the tide, we weren’t waiting  
Here comes the sweet freedom  
It’s spring after all  
I’ll see you even if there’s an abyss  
Move, my dear, and drive me crazy  
Drawing conclusions, they silently envy us  
Knowing me, I won’t give you to anyone  
I won’t give you away, yeah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A hundred problems in my head, well, so be it  
Don’t let anyone closer than me  
Our quarrels are on fire, my dear, know  
Wherever I am, I have you  

[Chorus]  
It feels like every morning  
You remember me, call me  
If you need, I’ll fly to you  
It feels like every morning  
You remember me, call me  
If you need, I’ll fly to you
