**[Pre-Chorus]**  
She’s always been like this  
She looks like… money in her eyes  
She looks like a super mega star  
She looks like, looks like, looks like…

**[Chorus]**  
She looks like mommy among everyone in this club  
Her style is always stunning, everything fits her perfectly  
She’s always doing fine, you should open the door for her  
Birkin bag, she’s twerking, what will you say to her now?  
She looks like mommy among everyone in this club  
Her style is always stunning, everything fits her perfectly  
She’s always doing fine, you should open the door for her  
Birkin bag, she’s twerking, what will you say to her now?

**[Verse]**  
Everyone in this chat wants to hang out with her at the after-party  
She looks so strong from behind, damn, like a red Ferrari  
The silhouette of her body — everyone recognized her at the bar  
And they threw money at her, here’s money mo-mommy  
Her face, face, face, face, face  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
Hustle every day, fame is her target  
Her press, press, press, press, press  
Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass  
Big cash will take away all her stress  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
She’s always been like this  
She looks like… money in her eyes  
She looks like a super mega star  
She looks like, looks like, looks like…

**[Chorus]**  
She looks like mommy among everyone in this club  
Her style is always stunning, everything fits her perfectly  
She’s always doing fine, you should open the door for her  
Birkin bag, she’s twerking, what will you say to her now?  
She looks like mommy among everyone in this club  
Her style is always stunning, everything fits her perfectly  
She’s always doing fine, you should open the door for her  
Birkin bag, she’s twerking, what will you say to her now?
