**[Intro]**  
Skrrt Skrrt, Blink  

**[Verse]**  
Good morning wood, I'm smoking backwood  
Spinning high up, it takes everyone's breath away (tu-tu)  
Icy moves, just feel this groove  
We don't drag anchors, but we carry the whole game  
Illusion of deception, I’m like Ed Marlo  
I pass through time and don’t notice the edges (don’t notice)  
Rolling with this thottie in an Inferno to my trap house (trap house)  
Laser aimed at the brain, blast detects her mind  
Dropped in the ditch, this wigga - John Doe  
Every cricket, hey, know your stick  
Hella xans, hella hoes, give me the antidote (antidote)  
I’m the Wolf of Wall Street, you’re just a pathetic clown (ski, ski)  

**[Chorus]**  
Hell Race, I’m a hellraiser (skrrt)  
My place - my spaceship  
I want to leave my trace (yeah-yeah)  
I want to surface (hey)  
Hell Race, I’m a hellraiser (skrrt)  
My place - my spaceship  
I want to leave my trace (yeah-yeah)  
I want to surface  

**[Verse]**  
I’m using a rage spell, blade of Cain (Cain)  
Damned forever, I’m desperate (rate)  
Skin and bones, tear to shreds  
Wanna survive - run away  
Above me a rainbow, brother rejoices (rejoices)  
Joker in the pack, hoe, tricks reversed (reversed)  
Die but break through, corpse on the hook  
Bitch, I tell her to stop  
Tip the scales in my favor (prr-prr)  
All your efforts are doomed to failure  
Do not salt the wound, cure me baby  
Make them afraid, call me a hanger  
Every hero needs his own villain  
There’s plenty of room in this coliseum  
I will not dance in your play  
Jump over the abyss, zigzags of fate  

**[Chorus]**  
Hell Race, I’m a hellraiser  
My place - my spaceship  
I want to leave my trace (yeah-yeah)  
I want to surface (ski)  
Hell Race, I’m a hellraiser  
My place - my spaceship  
I want to leave my trace (yeah-yeah)  
I want to surface (ski)
