**[Intro: Элджей]**  
Sayonara Boy  
Sayonara Boy  

**[Chorus: MORGENSHTERN]**  
She doesn’t need anything, no,  
Neither Prada nor the truth, that’s true.  
I can’t recognize your gaze, your gaze,  
Baby, yeah, we’re together, but not close, m-m.  

**[Verse 1: Arut]**  
I remember the day in that old little apartment,  
Promised myself I’d bring you the whole world on one hand.  
No one else in it, just us two, no one more,  
But now there’s no “us” anymore.  
Those versions of us can’t be brought back,  
I’m not even close to who I used to be.  
I’m lying to you, you’re lying to yourself too,  
Now I can buy everything you wanted, yeah-eh,  
But you won’t fall for that, yeah-eh.  
To tell you the whole truth, yeah-eh —  
This is my last gift (My last gift).  

**[Chorus: MORGENSHTERN]**  
She doesn’t need anything, no,  
Neither Prada nor the truth, that’s true.  
I can’t recognize your gaze, your gaze,  
Baby, yeah, we’re together, but not close, we’re not close.  

**[Verse 2: Элджей]**  
I could love you if I were someone else,  
I’d cut off the hands of your stylist and makeup artist.  
But I decided to just walk away,  
Let your mom and dog live in our house by the Istra.  
Fines come for the car, means you’re going somewhere,  
I haven’t been in Russia for six months, and you say you miss me.  
All that’s left of us is just a combination of keys,  
You chewed us up like two Orbit gum pieces with watermelon.  
Now our dinner is a friendly dinner,  
Chopsticks and sushi, sometimes just sushi.  
No one else will ever be our first wife and husband.  

**[Chorus: MORGENSHTERN]**  
She doesn’t need anything, no,  
Neither Prada nor the truth, that’s true.  
I can’t recognize your gaze, your gaze,  
Baby, yeah, we’re together, but not close, m-m.  
She doesn’t need anything, no,  
Neither Prada nor the truth, that’s true.  
I can’t recognize your gaze, your gaze,  
Baby, yeah, we’re together, but not close, we’re not close.
