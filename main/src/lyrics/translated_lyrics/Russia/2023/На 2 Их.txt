**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: V $ X V PRiNCE]**  
I multiply money, always in the plus  
A white BMW cruising at night — that’s the vibe (Yeah)  
Picked up some cargo on the way  
Daur pulls up, opens FruityLoops (Yeah)  
I don’t linger long over my verse  
From home, I was shining all over the floor (Yeah)  
Wanna see Almaty? I can show you (Ah)  
If I get hungry, I’ll order something for myself (Yeah)  
Mom said: “Earn it yourself (Ding)  
Be self-made, dirty money will come” (Uh-huh)  
Moves smoothly — that’s my boy (Yeah)  
If I grill meat — I grill it well done (One more time)  
Mom said: “Earn it yourself (Yeah)  
Be self-made, dirty money will come” (Uh-huh)  
Moves smoothly — that’s my boy  
If I grill meat — I grill it well done  
Don’t doubt it, this is on repeat  
I’m calling Guf, Guf will call Vitya (Hello)  
It’s like Dre calling Fifty  
Had a little drink today, brothers, forgive me  
Don’t doubt it, this is on repeat (On repeat)  
I’m calling Guf, Guf will call Vitya (Hello)  
It’s like Dre calling Fifty  
Had a little drink today, brothers, forgive me  

**[Chorus: V $ X V PRiNCE]**  
(Uh-uh) This is the sound of da police  
(Uh-uh) Got caught — don’t spill (Don’t spill)  
(Uh-uh) Rock with it, what’s the hold-up? (What’s the hold-up?)  
(Uh-uh) Vitya AK, Aska Prince  
(Uh-uh) This is the sound of da police (Yeah)  
(Uh-uh) Got caught — don’t spill (Don’t spill)  
(Uh-uh) Rock with it, what’s the hold-up? (What’s the hold-up?)  
(Uh-uh) Vitya AK, Aska Prince  

**[Verse 2: Vitya AK]**  
Jumped on the beat, kicking down the door  
Charging my verse to blow your mind  
Look at this girl, she’s got perky nips  
Wipe your nose, kid, you must be catching a cold  
Cruising in an X5 M through the streets of Almaty  
Like family, we clicked, just like homies do  
Who’s talking about us? Just some chatterboxes  
How can I look them in the eye later? I don’t know, boys  
We’re tearing up this beat with Aska Prince together  
When we cash out — we’ll share it with our own  
I remember everyone I owe, can’t forget what’s been  
We really stepped on the gas, everyone’s left behind  
My neighborhood’s falling asleep, I’m packing a full bong  
And inhaling deeply, like I’m King Kong  
I’ve been in this game for a while, you know what’s up  
I don’t know what you’re on, we’re like Cheech and Chong  
This music flies like a meteorite  
If you can’t digest it, then you’ve got gastritis  
It’s a potent mix, look who’s gathered here  
This is the sound of my streets, this is the sound of police (Uh)  

**[Chorus: V $ X V PRiNCE]**  
(Uh-uh) This is the sound of da police  
(Uh-uh) Got caught — don’t spill (Don’t spill)  
(Uh-uh) Rock with it, what’s the hold-up? (What’s the hold-up?)  
(Uh-uh) Vitya AK, Aska Prince  
(Uh-uh) This is the sound of da police (Yeah)  
(Uh-uh) Got caught — don’t spill (Don’t spill)  
(Uh-uh) Rock with it, what’s the hold-up? (What’s the hold-up?)  
(Uh-uh) Vitya AK, Aska Prince  

**[Outro: Vitya AK & V $ X V PRiNCE]**  
Yeah  
20-22 (Let’s go)  
Almaty, Moscow (Salam Aleikum)  
Waving to all our people (Yeah)  
Bro, drink some water, don’t cough (Woo-woo-woo)
