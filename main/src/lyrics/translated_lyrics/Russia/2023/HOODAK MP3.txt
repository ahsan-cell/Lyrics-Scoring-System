**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Olesya Slukina]  
Today we twirl in a white dance  
Maybe we'll become friends, you and I  
And at night we'll stay together  
But in the morning, we'll part forever  
(Yo, Kemortan smashed that one)  
Ah, in the morning, we'll part forever  
(Damn, Aarne goin' cra—)  
(DJ Tape)

[Verse 1: Big Baby Tape]  
Ding-ding, a new pack has arrived  
Pulled out all the grams, sent them to the press (Press)  
Broski hides his face  
Ski mask on him — finesse professor  
Look, I grinded for a long time — now we flex (Cash)  
Girls just want clout and fame  
They don't care about the essence, it drives me crazy (Brr)  
****, he snitched like — his weight didn’t make it to the tech  
M****t didn’t take stars for himself: he took the cash — now cruising in a Beamer (Boss)  
If we’re not friends, then you’re not my enemy (Oh no)  
I just don’t want you sitting and eating at my table  
(Listen) Hey, baby, hello? (Hello?)  
Pick up the phone quickly (Quickly)  
It’s seven in the morning in Dubai, and we’re still not together (Yeah)  
Yes, I call you only when I’m in trouble, so what? (So what?)  
I feel so close to you, yet so far away  
Tell me, if I want you again, will you be here for me? (For me)  
And will you do it with me on the floor until morning? (Oh yeah)  
Yeah, I’d forget you, but I don’t know how (How?)  
I’ll leave you a skinny guy, and also this slow jam  

[Chorus: Olesya Slukina]  
Today we twirl in a white dance  
Maybe we'll become friends, you and I  
And at night we'll stay together  
But in the morning, we'll part forever  
Today we twirl in a white dance  
Maybe we'll become friends, you and I  
And at night we'll stay together  
But in the morning, we'll part forever  
(DJ Tape)  
We’ll stay together—  
(Damn, Aarne goin' cra—)  
And at night—  
But in the morning, forever—

[Bridge: Big Baby Tape]  
And the diamonds, diamonds spin around me  
And your girl will stay with me  
Looks like she likes me  
But in the morning, we’ll say goodbye  

[Verse 2: Big Baby Tape]  
I’m not used to you, so baby, don’t get used to me (Uh-huh)  
If you’re lonely, then, bae, come over to me (Come over)  
I can’t give you love, but I can give you my member (Member)  
I can’t save hoes, 'cause I’m not Superman (Oh no)  
No, I’m not Superman (Hey), I’m worth a lot, man (Yeah)  
I see them from afar, yeah, I have X-ray vision (X-ray)  
What’s your plan? (Plan) Bro, to make a lot of cash (A ton)  
I was on the trap yesterday, but I promised I’d left for good (Lied)  

[Pre-Chorus: Olesya Slukina]  
Today we twirl in white-white  
Maybe—, surely we’ll become friends  
Today we twirl in white-white  
Maybe—, surely we’ll become friends  
(Damn, Aarne goin' cra—)

[Chorus: Olesya Slukina]  
Today we twirl in a white dance (DJ Tape)  
Maybe we'll become friends, you and I  
And at night we'll stay together  
But in the morning, we'll part forever  
And at night—  
We’ll stay together—  
And at night—  
But in the morning, forever—

[Outro: Olesya Slukina]  
And at night—  
We’ll stay together—  
And at night—  
But in the morning, forever—  
(Yo, Kemortan smashed that one)
