**Translated Lyrics:**

But  
I’ll be there next time  
I’ll be there next time  

[Verse 1]  
Come hang out  
'Cause you’re going crazy  
You’re working so hard  
You’ve forgotten what you love  
And come hang out  
Don’t leave us behind  
But I’ll be there next time  
I’ll be there next time  
Hey, hey, hey  
But I’ll be there next time  
Hey, hey (Now it feels so—)  
But I’ll be there next time  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  

[Verse 2]  
Haters, where are my haters?  
I’m just gonna keep doing me  
Haters, where are my haters?  
I think I’m still going out  
Haters, where are my haters?  
Don’t you want to help me feel something again?  
Haters, where are my haters?  
I think I’m still going out  

[Bridge]  
And now after all  
I really want to call my  
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-pa-papa  
Pa-pa-pa-papa  
Pa-pa-pa-pa-papa  
Da-da-da—  

[Verse 3]  
Should I go for more clicks this year  
Or should I follow the click in my ear?  
Should I go for more clicks this year  
Or should I follow the click in my ear? (But I’m weak)  
Should I go for more clicks this year (and what’s wrong with that?)  
Or should I follow the click in my ear? (I’m weak)  
Should I aim for more clicks this year?  

[Verse 4]  
But I’m weak (Should I go for more clicks) (Drama)  
I really want to call my dad  
And what’s wrong with that?  
And what’s wrong with that?  
But I’m weak  
Should I go for more clicks this year  
Or should I follow the click in my ear? (I have a friend like you)  
Should I go for more clicks this year (Drama)  
Or should I follow the click in my ear? (Next time)  

[Outro]  
Should I go for more clicks this year  
Or should I follow the click in my ear?  
Should I go for more clicks this year  
Or should I follow the c-
