**Translated Lyrics:**

1  
I wove my dance  
Around me  
Where the music gave us intoxicating highs  
Of different kinds  
There was a time I could hold myself together  
Until I could turn my gaze away from you  
I followed you like a blind man without a guide  
In those days when you would shelter me from the heat  
So that sadness couldn’t pull me along, behind me  

**Chorus:**  
And I saw how love spoke for us  
The fires of youth beat in my chest  
There, the sunset's glow beckoned me  
With a melody that carried us away so freely  
We  

Danced until we fell  
The music swept us off our feet  
We needed no one else  
I couldn’t leave without you x2  

You lured me with your will  
Where stars touched, my hand found  
Your beauty flowed like harmonies  
We can’t build with our bodies  
What the soul has raised  
So stay with me here  
The night won’t be dark  
For you are mine  
You're mine, you're mine  
Mine, oh, oh, oh  
You are mine  
You're mine, you're mine  
My cherished one, oh, oh  

**Chorus:**  
And I saw how love spoke for us  
The fires of youth beat in my chest  
There, the sunset's glow beckoned me  
With a melody that carried us away so freely  
We  

Danced until we fell  
The music swept us off our feet  
We needed no one else  
I couldn’t leave without you x2
