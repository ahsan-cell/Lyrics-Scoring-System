**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Ilyas Gayazov]  
I let ultramarine flow through my eyes  
Then I treat you roughly once again  
And on my lips, the amphetamine has melted  
We'll reveal our dances before the chaos begins  
There, to the absurd, the heart is tense  
We make our moves, bringing it to a boil  
From a straw, multi-fruit, catapult, spinning top  
Wonders will lead us where the music hits our ears  
Let’s dance now, stir up some commotion here  
In our drinks, I've mixed in some speed

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
I walk under a drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt  
I walk under a drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt

[Verse 2: Timur Gayazov]  
All our words are cloaked in the night  
They foretold us love, but we’re so corrupt  
Blue, blue, blue ice, like a Tamagotchi  
I just want to know that you care for me deeply  
You loved me, but I couldn't keep up (Eh)  
You ran away, and I couldn't catch up, no  
Drunken haze, girl, I'm lost in my thoughts  
And if this is all a game, then who lost? (Eh)

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
I walk under a drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt  
Under this drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt

[Refrain: Ilyas Gayazov]  
I walk under a drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt only

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
I walk under a drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt  
Under this drunken haze, kicking the air with my Nikes  
My soul flies and soars over Jamaica  
Under this drunken haze, I like your pics  
You're next to him, but you're wearing my shirt
