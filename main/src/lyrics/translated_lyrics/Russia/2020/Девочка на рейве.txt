**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Elvira T]**  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi, it's her first time in the club  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi  

**[Verse 1: Elvira T]**  
She’s young, but she wants  
A love that’s fierce and strong  
To feel herself torn apart  
The music tears at her throat  
While no one’s caught  
Her little secret on her tights  
At thirty degrees  
She’ll down a drink in one go  
And start to have some fun  
Looking for her prince  
But here, it’s just peers  
What she needs is a techno knight  

**[Chorus: Elvira T]**  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi, it's her first time in the club  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi  

**[Verse 2: Elvira T]**  
On the dance floor, everyone’s a stranger  
She knows no one here  
They’re all half-alive  
The music hits hard  
In her ears and eardrums  
But it’s still pretty cool  
It feels like a half-dream  
She doesn’t understand anything  
Just swept away  
Her gaze is blank  
And tonight she  
Won’t be going home...  
(Won’t be going home...)  

**[Chorus: Elvira T]**  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi, it's her first time in the club  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi, it's her first time in the club  

**[Verse 3: O.T]**  
Lightly watching you  
You naive girl blending with the crowd  
This is your favorite day, bright, fast, sour  
Feeling like a superstar, hey  
Chikula at the rave! High as a kite  
I’ll call them “Mommy, go home,” we’ve got it all at home  
City panorama, comfort, tea with cake  
I’m stocked up on top-shelf goodies  
The whole crew like lipstick  
On the lips, babe, we melt, blonde, you’re happy  
A day isn’t enough for you, take a break, darling  
Don’t forget, you’re going to be a mom  

**[Chorus: Elvira T]**  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi, it's her first time in the club  
Girl at the rave, glossy lips  
Eyes like Bambi, it's her first time in the club
