**Translated Lyrics:**

Yes

Dawn

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

This is a hot summer

You’re on the beach, undressed

(Ha-Ha)

And I’m catching moments

Glasses in the wind

Don’t care about advice

(Yes)

Leaving all the work behind

(Forever)

Ignoring the problems

(Hooray)

We’re running wherever our eyes lead

No one knows where we are

(Yes)

Where are we? Where are we?

They don’t know where we are

Where are we? Where are we?

They don’t know where we are

This moment can’t be missed

I want to repeat it with you

Dawns and sunsets

We won’t have enough

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

Everything’s going as planned

(Yes)

Lipstick on my shirt

(Yours)

We searched for so long

Found it and disappeared

What else do we need?

(All of you)

Let’s continue

(Let’s continue)

Don’t be cautious

(Never)

You’re the sweetest poison

In my veins under my skin

(Yah)

And this moment

Gives us a chance

(Chance)

To feel very close

(Ah)

The moonlight

Suddenly went out

We dissolved in this disco

(Disco)

We’ll meet the dawns

Start at sunset

You and I this summer

Not quite sane

Catching the moment

Catching the wave

I want more

And I’ll repeat

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

We’re in nirvana

In the same color scheme

I’m so drawn to you

You’re like a gummy bear

And dawn

You’re like a gummy bear
