**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Everything—everything has become tiresome to me this evening  
I wanted to cruise through the night in Moscow  
I start up my baby  
Jumping into the ride, rolling a smoke on the side  
No—moving slowly towards the Sparrow Hills  
I’ve got some new hip-hop playing softly  
I don’t care who you are out there,  
I’m moving without a reason  

[Bridge]  
I’m moving without a reason, I’m moving without a reason  
Mov—moving without a reason, I’m moving without a reason  
Mov—moving without a reason, I’m moving without a reason  
Mov—moving without a reason, I’m moving without a reason  
I’m moving without a reason to where the lights of my city shimmer  

[Chorus]  
Moving without a reason, yeah, I’m moving without a reason there (Pow-pow!)  
Moving without a reason to where the light shines, the light of my city (Let’s go!)  
Moving without a reason (Without a reason) Yeah, I’m moving without a reason (Where?)  
I’m moving without a reason to where the lights of my city shimmer  

[Verse 2]  
Beams at the turn  
The vocals are smooth, like Luciano Pavarotti  
On the speed, over a hundred  
Hiding from the cops once again like John Gotti  
They just shouldn’t mess with me  
The guys are already on site  
Yeah, we’ll blow up this evening  
We don’t need a reason to organize a meet-up  

[Bridge]  
I’m moving without a reason, I’m moving without a reason  
Mov—moving without a reason  

[Chorus]  
Moving without a reason, yeah, I’m moving without a reason there (Pow-pow!)  
Moving without a reason to where the light shines, the light of my city (Let’s go!)  
Moving without a reason (Without a reason) Yeah, I’m moving without a reason (Where?)  
I’m moving without a reason to where the lights of my city shimmer  

[Verse 3]  
Me and my city don’t sleep  
You can’t make our crew sleep while there’s excitement  
That guy was literally cool  
Now he’s behind us and appreciates how we fly  
Avoiding the traffic police  
To them, we’re a tasty catch, but today we’re their stress  
Like a UFO disappearing  
We don’t need a reason, and we’re not facing arrest  

[Chorus]  
Moving without a reason, yeah, I’m moving without a reason there (Pow-pow!)  
Moving without a reason to where the light shines, the light of my city (Let’s go!)  
Moving without a reason (Without a reason) Yeah, I’m moving without a reason (Where?)  
I’m moving without a reason to where the lights of my city shimmer
