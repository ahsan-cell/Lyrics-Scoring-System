**[Round 1: Isla De Muerta]**  
**[Intro]**  
I've always wanted to know what real gangsters born in Bishkek look like  

**[Chorus]**  
What do you know, fake gangsta  
When bullets never flew around the block  
I fall asleep in a box of sweet dreams  
You’re not alone here, there are two of us  
Who will you call, fake gangsta  
When daddy won’t buy you a chair  
I fall asleep in a box of sweet dreams  
You’re not alone here, there are two of us  

**[Verse]**  
I’m alone, but there are two of us  
Every battle for me feels like sparring with myself  
Who are you?  
If there's chaos, I’m all in  
Instead of wasting energy, I plan  
To bring you back to zero, oh boy  
Close your eyes, bastard  
I outline you with white chalk  
You walked around like a fool in Bishkek  
I heard you and your kind of idiots in stickers  
Seeing all this crap, I saved my strength for takedowns  
To hit big, to hit right  
In a closed space, you’ll crack like a chocolate bar  
Just business, hit and take the cash  
Forget basketball, with Killa we’ll play Russian roulette  
Throwing down a verse  
I’ll talk you through it like there’s nothing to do  
OGs are loved by girls only with Danny Trejo’s face  
My hands are asking for checks  
My dolls silence the fakes  
These pussies ask for money  
Aftertaste from brandy  
Well, like a chocolate bar  
I’ll devour you just like a chocolate bar  
OG in a knockdown  
You’re a musician by templates  
With you, I can afford to battle vocally  
The wardrobe smells like shit  
In this high fashion game  
We’re smoking this deep flow mode  
Sorry, but not today  

**[Chorus]**  
What do you know, fake gangsta  
When bullets never flew around the block  
I fall asleep in a box of sweet dreams  
You’re not alone here, there are two of us  
Who will you call, fake gangsta  
When daddy won’t buy you a chair  
I fall asleep in a box of sweet dreams  
You’re not alone here, there are two of us  

**[Round 1: Gokilla]**  
**[Intro]**  
Ah, wooo, yeah, this is some trap, okay, this is some trap  
Gang-gang-gang  
My people are gang-gang-gang  
You’re a pussy boy, but you talk tough - savage  

**[Verse 1]**  
Your text is ice, it’s empty, waffle  
I came again for the price to fuck the vacuum  
What kind of mambe are you? You’re a fucking loser  
You’ll spit your verse and then go fuck yourself  
Like Dan Pecheini, I clean up rappers  
I raise money on them, and do it again  
You know, man, my shadow will fuck you up  
Because I’m a level higher, like I’m working out in mid  
Yeah!  
When my people are in the building, your people are invisible  
Every dog wants to grab their fillet, but you’ve torn your sphincter  
To become the best MC on beats, you crazy fuck  
You got so stylish that you’re almost a faggot, ahahaha  
Yeah, Jah Khalib, when you dropped your verse on the fit, I thought:  
“Fuck, man, this is disgusting, bitch, such an anchor won’t pull a jeep”  
And even though they invited all of Kazakhstan to the fit, you were happy like a fool to the core  
But you’re fucking useless to anyone, even if you rap with Nazarbayev  

**[Hook]**  
I’m grinding, fuck lazy-lazy-lazy  
My people are gang-gang-gang  
Shining so bright, I caused damage  
You’re a pussy boy, but you talk tough - savage  
I’m grinding, fuck lazy-lazy-lazy  
My people are gang-gang-gang  
Shining so bright, I caused damage  
You’re a pussy boy, but you talk tough - savage  

**[Outro]**  
Whoa, fat shit, how do you like that rhyme, you bastard?  
Such a rhyme  

**[Round 2: Isla De Muerta]**  
**[Chorus]**  
What are you bringing them into this world?  
What can you not prove?  
All this business is like a cartoon  
I’m left to draw  
On the canvas among the showcases  
The cheapest exhibit  
And you wanted to sell yourself for more  
What can you give them?  
Nothing, nothing  
Nothing, nothing
