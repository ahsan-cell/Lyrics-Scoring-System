**[Intro]**  
*Oh-oh-oh-oh, again Clonnex*  
*FLOWRENCY*  

**[Chorus]**  
Our Zhiguli's like a Bentley  
Our Zhiguli's like a Merc  
I put a girl in the backseat  
And quietly drove her to the woods  
Zhiguli, city of Tolyatti  
I sped faster than a Bugatti  
I left everyone behind at the start  
You'll see the shine of the taillights  
Our Zhiguli's like a Bentley  
Our Zhiguli's like a Merc  
I put a girl in the backseat  
And quietly drove her to the woods  
Zhiguli, city of Tolyatti  
I sped faster than a Bugatti  
I left everyone behind at the start  
You'll see the shine of the taillights  

**[Verse]**  
I put you in the back of a luxury sedan for your comfort  
You got overtaken, the brake lights shine brighter than a traffic light  
Like on the highway, we drive on any road  
It speeds like a Lambo, but it drinks very little gas  
I accidentally pressed the pedal – I'm in hyperdrive  
A queue from the exhaust, and it shoots like a bazooka  
If it's not there – I guarantee you'll lose your hearing  
The Zhiguli has no brakes, my brain is all out of fluid  
You can drift the Zhiguli sideways, just like two plus two  
Only pros behind the wheel, spinning heads around  
Need rocket fuel – AI-92  
It's easy to wreck the suspension, this isn't Moscow  

**[Chorus]**  
Our Zhiguli's like a Bentley  
Our Zhiguli's like a Merc  
I put a girl in the backseat  
And quietly drove her to the woods  
Zhiguli, city of Tolyatti  
I sped faster than a Bugatti  
I left everyone behind at the start  
You'll see the shine of the taillights  
Our Zhiguli's like a Bentley  
Our Zhiguli's like a Merc  
I put a girl in the backseat  
And quietly drove her to the woods  
Zhiguli, city of Tolyatti  
I sped faster than a Bugatti  
I left everyone behind at the start  
You'll see the shine of the taillights
