**[Verse 1]**  
It's not my business what you should do,  
Your naked body in my bed, it's true.  
I smoke a joint and count my cash,  
After the second round, you call me sweet as a flash.  
I don’t miss you, but inside it sparkles,  
Melting and sparkling, melting and sparkling.  
Melting and sparkling, melting and sparkling,  
Melting and sparkling, melting and sparkling.  
It's pointless that I know your secrets,  
All your double games, I see through the regrets.  
Pointless that I know your secrets,  
All your double games, I see through the regrets.  
My years won’t return,  
Neither your love nor the money I yearn.  
You want to take joy and sorrow away,  
But inside my heart, there’s nothing left to say.

**[Chorus]**  
Here’s my life: bought and sold,  
Dying in lies, I see no reason to hold.  
Do you see the floors? There: bought and sold,  
To throw away this day, I see no reason to be bold.  
Here’s my life: bought and sold,  
Dying in lies, I see no reason to hold.  
Do you see the floors? There: bought and sold,  
To throw away this day, I see no reason to be bold.

**[Verse 2]**  
Thought it was easy to fly so high,  
Crashing at a girl’s place with my booze nearby.  
Drink, argue, screw, hide my face,  
Acting like a drunken fool, thinking of another place.  
But no talk, we keep control,  
It’s pointless you’re calling me when I’m on a roll.  
Today’s a day off, turned into a black streak,  
We took the ride in Dirk's car, feeling unique.  
And my phone isn’t your support line,  
I’m just passing through, always in a rush, never fine.  
A bunch of losers trying to grab your attention,  
But only you can soothe my soul’s tension.  
Every day you blow to avoid looking tired,  
Chasing demons to stay cool, inspired.  
With a dreamy gaze, you look from the balcony down,  
Not finding what you did, stepping on the ground.  
Satisfying desires with a sweet little kiss,  
But for me, it’s nothing to make your body twist.  
Listening to no one, reaching out to God,  
A bunch of bitches won’t cover your lonely facade (Your lonely facade).

**[Bridge]**  
Oh-oh-oh-oo, oh-oh-oh-oo,  
A bunch of bitches won’t cover your lonely facade (Your lonely facade).  
Oh-oh-oh-oo, oh-oh-oh-oo,  
A bunch of bitches won’t cover your...

**[Chorus]**  
Here’s my life: bought and sold,  
Dying in lies, I see no reason to hold.  
Do you see the floors? There: bought and sold,  
To throw away this day, I see no reason to be bold.  
Here’s my life: bought and sold,  
Dying in lies, I see no reason to hold.  
Do you see the floors? There: bought and sold,  
To throw away this day, I see no reason to be bold.
