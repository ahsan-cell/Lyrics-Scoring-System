**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Oh God, I searched for you in the dark, blindly  
Pain struck my battered temples  
Nicotine and whiskey couldn't save me  

[Verse 1]  
Baby, it's show-time, sorry, you're not my type  
Though I thought you were in my dreams  
Baby, it's fake love, feelings turned to slow-mo  
But everything froze in your eyes  
I don't feel a pulse, nothing can help  
To see the sunset, I step out on the balcony  
I don't feel my hands, nothing can help  
This song is for you, but love  

[Chorus, x2]  
Oh God, I caressed you in the dark, blindly  
Pain struck my battered temples  
Nicotine and whiskey couldn't save me  
You should know, I'm in love  

[Verse 2]  
The sky turned white  
I'm running through these streets, as if I’ve never been here  
Oh fuck, would you turn to ashes  
If I promised to scatter you in icy clouds?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
My baby, stop lying, I’m switching places  
Today I'm drunk, but that won't save me  
My baby, stop lying, I’m switching places  
Today I'm drunk, and it’s again because of you  

[Chorus, x2]  
Oh God, I searched for you in the dark, blindly  
Pain struck my battered temples  
Nicotine and whiskey couldn't save me  
You should know, I'm in love  

[Outro]  
Oh God, I searched for you in the dark, blindly  
Pain struck my battered temples  
Nicotine and whiskey couldn't save me  
Oh God  
Oh God, I searched for you in the dark, blindly  
Pain struck my battered temples  
Nicotine and whiskey couldn't save me  
You should know, I'm in love
