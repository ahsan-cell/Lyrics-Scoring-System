**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
A big guy walked with a smile through the night park,  
And by the quiet pond, he met a fortune teller.  
The young man turned to her: "Here’s what I want to know -  
How many days do I have left? Tell me, how will I go?"

[Chorus]  
And the cards fell on the snow, and the old woman said to the lad  
Through her hoarse laughter:  
"All bloodied is the unfortunate Jack, and above him, a terrible Queen  
With a knife in her hand!"

[Verse 2]  
And the big guy exclaimed, rubbing his hands:  
"What do you want to say to me? I don’t understand."  
And a knife gleamed in the dark, and laughter rang out:  
"Right here and right now, it’s going to be bad for you!"

[Chorus]  
And the body fell on the snow, and the old woman said to the lad  
Through her hoarse laughter:  
"All bloodied is the unfortunate Jack, and above him, a terrible Queen  
With a knife in her hand!"

[Verse 3]  
The witch glanced at the body  
And vanished in an unknown direction!

[Outro]  
"All bloodied is the unfortunate Jack, and above him, a terrible Queen  
With a knife in her hand!"
