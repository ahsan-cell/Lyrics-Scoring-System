**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Ilyas Gayazov]  
You’re breaking the rules while I’m picking cherries,  
Just yesterday it didn’t matter, today it’s too heavy.  
I dance awkwardly to seem like I belong,  
My plane is made of paper, your kiss is like a song.  

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
(So what? So what?)  

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
My creed, grant me flight,  
Once you were like ice — now you dance and sing bright.  
She dances and sings — cold as ice,  
No one will find us, no one will find us, right?  
My creed, grant me flight,  
Once you were like ice — now you dance and sing bright.  
She dances and sings — cold as ice,  
No one will find us, no one will find us, right?  

[Verse 2: Ilyas Gayazov]  
Of course, there are no limits — I’ll be who you want;  
If you melt a little, we’ll stay till dawn.  
Look how sad he is — make him feel alive,  
At least for today, everything feels so right.  
My creed takes off her kimono,  
Black lace, I’m feeling low.  
She’s so cold, like an “Eskimo,”  
In this flight of hers, I’ve been swept away, oh.  

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
(So what? So what?)  

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
My creed, grant me flight,  
Once you were like ice — now you dance and sing bright.  
She dances and sings — cold as ice,  
No one will find us, no one will find us, right?  
My creed, grant me flight,  
Once you were like ice — now you dance and sing bright.  
She dances and sings — cold as ice,  
No one will find us, no one will find us, right?  

[Verse 3: Timur Gayazov]  
So what? So what? And I’m flying high,  
I feel the freedom, soaring in the sky.  
More, more, I want some more!  
We’ve danced so many times, I’ve lost the score.  
Come on, come on, straight to the clouds!  
I’m already here, open the door now.  
Come on, come on, I’m your Malay!  
Girl, know that I’m yours, don’t be shy.  

[Chorus: Timur Gayazov]  
My creed, grant me flight,  
Once you were like ice — now you dance and sing bright.  
She dances and sings — cold as ice,  
No one will find us, no one will find us, right?  
My creed, grant me flight,  
Once you were like ice — now you dance and sing bright.  
She dances and sings — cold as ice,  
No one will find us, no one will find us, right?
