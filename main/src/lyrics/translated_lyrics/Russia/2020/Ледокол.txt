**[Intro]**  
Palagin on the beat

**[Chorus]**  
I need you, baby, like a Lambo  
To rev up and go, ring ring row  
Hell under the hood, I jump in the ride  
Neon rain, just like Bangkok  
We’re smoking Gensli, right after [?]  
I carve a cross for her, a heartbreaker  
She wants it right here, no time for calls  
And I’m not worried about what comes next  
Bambi, roll me another one  
Clean as a stone on your chest  
We don’t know what awaits us ahead  
But I’m ready to find out with you, come closer

**[Verse 1]**  
I stripped her of all her clothes  
Sweat drips from her, and I know what she’s waiting for  
I’m making my contribution  
She asks for more, who knows how far we’ll go  
I sprinkle stardust on her, stardust from the skies  
And blow it all up to the ceiling  
She wants to be with me now, but then she'll leave  
And I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  
I’ll give her everything for that  

**[Chorus]**  
I need you, baby, like a Lambo  
Hell under the hood, I jump in the ride  
We’re smoking Gensli, right after [?]  
I carve a cross for her, a heartbreaker  
She wants it right here, no time for calls  
And I’m not worried about what comes next  
Bambi, roll me another one  
Clean as a stone on your chest  
We don’t know what awaits us ahead  
But I’m ready to find out with you, come closer  

I need you, baby, like a Lambo  
Hell under the hood, I jump in the ride  
We’re smoking Gensli, right after [?]  
I carve a cross for her, a heartbreaker  
She wants it right here, no time for calls  
And I’m not worried about what comes next  
Bambi, roll me another one  
Clean as a stone on your chest  
We don’t know what awaits us ahead  
But I’m ready to find out with you, come closer
