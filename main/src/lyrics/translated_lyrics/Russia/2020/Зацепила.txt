**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I’m stuck on you  
For days on end now  
My friends have long  
Started to lose me  
I call you to the movies  
But you don’t care at all  
And in your rose-colored glasses  
You can only see the clouds  
You don’t care about anyone  
And that’s why you’re alone  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I won’t get in your way  
You’ve caught my attention  
You’ve caught my attention  
In this world of beauty  
There’s a lack of simplicity  
You’ve caught my attention  

[Chorus]  
You’ve caught my attention  
You’ve caught my attention  
I sit here smoking alone  
Nicotine doesn’t save me  
Just forget and don’t remember  
Just forget and don’t remember  
You’ve caught my attention  
You’ve caught my attention  
I sit here smoking alone  
Nicotine doesn’t save me  
Just forget and don’t remember  
Just forget and don’t remember  

[Verse 2]  
In this sea of darkness, only you help me  
To understand that ahead there are many reasons  
To stay afloat, but I can’t do it anymore  
Do you hear me? I won’t let you down  
Because you’ve caught my attention  
You’ve caught my attention  
In this world of beauty  
There’s a lack of simplicity  
You’ve caught my attention  

[Chorus]  
You’ve caught my attention  
You’ve caught my attention  
I sit here smoking alone  
Nicotine doesn’t save me  
Just forget and don’t remember  
Just forget and don’t remember  
You’ve caught my attention  
You’ve caught my attention  
I sit here smoking alone  
Nicotine doesn’t save me  
Just forget and don’t remember  
Just forget and don’t remember
