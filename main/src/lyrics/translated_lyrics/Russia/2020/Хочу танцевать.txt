**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Lika Ramus]  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  

[Verse 1: Syava]  
After the first time I saw you, stranger  
From that very day, it’s been a break, and no peace ever since  
I can’t sleep, I can’t forget  
I want to know where I can find  
Ready to shout, how can this be?  
Where to search for you? Where should I go?  
At the party that night, the crowd was dancing  
And the DJ was mashing up hits  
I looked through the people, you were there alone  
It felt like it was just me and you  
I was scared to approach you  
To interrupt your magical dance  
Now I’m suffering, sleepless at night  
I want to dance with you  

[Chorus: Lika Ramus]  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
Only with you  

[Verse 2: Syava]  
Before her, everything was fine  
A rogue, a criminal  
Arriva, a musical hooligan  
But she on the dance floor — a hurricane  
Time, like hasta la vista  
And I felt frozen alive  
In my dreams, echoes reached me  
To rewind the timer back  
But can’t forget and can’t return  
If I meet her somewhere  
I believe I’ll take the risk  
And manage to whisper to her  
How scared I was to approach  
And interrupt the magical dance  
And now I’m suffering, sleepless at night  
I want to dance with you  

[Chorus: Lika Ramus]  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
Only with you  

[Bridge: Syava, Lika Ramus]  
Oh, can’t forget and can’t return  
If I meet her somewhere  
I believe I’ll take the risk  
And manage to whisper to her  
How scared I was to approach  
And interrupt the magical dance  
And now I’m suffering, sleepless at night  
I want to dance with you  

[Chorus: Lika Ramus]  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
I want to dance, I want only with you  
Only with you
