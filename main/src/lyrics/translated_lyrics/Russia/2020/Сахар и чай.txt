**Translated Lyrics:**

How will I go on, when no one cares?
The saddest songs play in my player,
Those very songs that the whole world loves to hear.

I don’t want anything, everything eats away at me,
Adding some color — my sad face.
I write you important words in "Telegram,"
How I loved you, how I loved you.

Sugar and tea, just the two of us in the apartment,
Let’s stay silent.
Sugar and tea, how we loved each other,
I will remember.

Sugar and tea, just the two of us in the apartment,
Let’s stay silent.
Sugar and tea, how we loved each other,
I will remember.
