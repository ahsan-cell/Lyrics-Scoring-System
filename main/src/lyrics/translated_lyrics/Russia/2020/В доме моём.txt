**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: VAIYA]  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Your dress swirls like the heavens above  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Our lips will meet, so that you can be mine  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Your dress swirls like the heavens above  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Our lips will meet, so that you can be mine  

[Verse 1: T1One]  
He watched her for a long time at the bar, thinking — a stranger (Ha)  
A Bond girl, a treasure, a find (Oh)  
Come on now, don’t hold back my nerves  
Sandalwood scent of black pu-erh tea  
You love me gloomy, love me for no reason  
I don’t care what, sometimes the apartment’s a battleground (Pow-pow)  
You love to send smoke rings up to the ceiling  
Everything’s hazy, but we’re in no rush to open the window  
Cherry tobacco, we’re smoking your favorite  
A magic carpet, beneath us the desert  
Your lashes and voice — an aphrodisiac  
You dance barefoot on silk sheets  

[Chorus: VAIYA]  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Your dress swirls like the heavens above  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Our lips will meet, so that you can be mine  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Your dress swirls like the heavens above  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Our lips will meet, so that you can be mine  

[Verse 2: ZippO]  
You are mine, you are mine with your lips  
You are mine, you are my tsunami  
Where have you led me and then disappeared?  
Chaos among the carnival  
Guest, bye, goodbye  
Don’t argue with me, just dance now  
Guest, bye, goodbye  
Dance, my wild one  
You fell in love, you caught me  
Stole my heart, daughter of the carnival  
You are mine, you are mine with your lips  
You are mine, you are my tsunami  
Where have you led me and then disappeared?  
Chaos among the carnival  

[Chorus: VAIYA]  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Your dress swirls like the heavens above  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Our lips will meet, so that you can be mine  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Your dress swirls like the heavens above  
In my house, you dance until the morning light  
Our lips will meet, so that you can be mine
