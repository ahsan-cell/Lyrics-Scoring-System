**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Burito]**  
When the earth awakens, quietly wait for me  
I’m no longer myself, I stop flailing  
I won’t leave you on the edge of oblivion  
I’m no longer myself, from any point of view  
A frozen scream in my throat  
I don’t know how it came to be  
I’m leaning more towards the thought  
That I’ve missed something somewhere  
A lost moment  
I know it would be easier  
Without pointless hysterics

**[Chorus: Svetlana Afanasyeva]**  
Take my heart  
Take my soul  
I’m so lonely at this hour  
That I want to die  
I have nowhere to go  
I’ve destroyed my world  
Only a candle weeps for me  
In the cold dawn

**[Verse 2: Burito]**  
The stars burn until morning, silver hues  
You always wanted to stay among them  
But apparently, it’s not meant to be, and your plea  
Made the heavens silently doubt  
You know, I owe you  
I almost perished  
But you revived me  
Like a pure spring  
A great joker  
Promised us both  
That we are just at the beginning

**[Chorus: Svetlana Afanasyeva]**  
Take my heart  
Take my soul  
I’m so lonely at this hour  
That I want to die  
I have nowhere to go  
I’ve destroyed my world  
Only a candle weeps for me  
In the cold dawn

**[Bridge: Burito]**  
Minimum words, minimum dreams  
Minimum voices  
Minimum words in my head  
We’re all out of our minds  
So long out of our minds  
We all are

**[Chorus: Svetlana Afanasyeva]**  
Take my heart  
Take my soul  
I’m so lonely at this hour  
That I want to die  
I have nowhere to go  
I’ve destroyed my world  
Only a candle weeps for me  
In the cold dawn
