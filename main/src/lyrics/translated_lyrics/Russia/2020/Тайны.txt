**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: DATA404]  
I don’t want to do, do, do this in the morning  
Out of 9 thousand girls, you’re the only one left  
I’m initiated into this order, 'cause I don’t play around  
But I’m smoking, smoking, smoking in the mountains to create the heavens  
I don’t want to do, do, do this in the morning  
Out of 9 thousand girls, you’re the only one left  
I’m initiated into this order, 'cause I don’t play around  
But I’m smoking, smoking, smoking in the mountains to create the heavens  

[Verse 1: DATA404]  
Sip Dr. Pepper  
In Margiela kids  
I’m moving forward  
So I don’t see their death  
She dances nearby  
I’m geekin' like Vercetti*  
Fangs on my neck  
But I didn’t notice them  

[Verse 2: ARLEKIN 40 000]  
Baby, I don’t touch fashion, fashion touches the body  
God does the work, he hasn’t slept for a week again  
I pray on my heart, there’s no time for the whore  
Artificial feelings will still be true to me  
You know why I trapped time, why I’m on the grind  
Why you’re not with me, 'cause the first one’s covering  
'Cause I’m growing up, hence the scars on my neck  
'Cause I’ll never get an answer from them  

[Chorus: DATA404]  
I don’t want to do, do, do this in the morning  
Out of 9 thousand girls, you’re the only one left  
I’m initiated into this order, 'cause I don’t play around  
But I’m smoking, smoking, smoking in the mountains to create the heavens  
I don’t want to do, do, do this in the morning  
Out of 9 thousand girls, you’re the only one left  
I’m initiated into this order, 'cause I don’t play around  
But I’m smoking, smoking, smoking in the mountains to create the heavens  

[Verse 3: ARLEKIN 40 000 & PHENO]  
I don’t want to do anything, especially by myself  
I’m pouring champagne, the bills will speak for us  
She’s a model, it’s a celebration, I won’t bargain with you  
Just took a big bag and I’ll smoke it myself  
Hey, she’s just another one for the streets  
I’ve got a girl blowing, and after that, the grass is blowing  
I’m Edward Cullen, babe, you know I hate the sun  
I’m sitting at home, can’t go out — the release is coming  
I fell in love with the check, with this Maybach, I have secrets  
99 problems, don’t mess up my plans  
Young, rich, on the grind and these herbs  
Mercedes bag, yeah, AMG — it costs a million  

[Outro: ARLEKIN 40 000]  
I don’t want to do anything, especially by myself  
I’m pouring champagne, the bills will speak for us  
She’s a model, it’s a celebration, I won’t bargain with you  
Just took a big bag and I’ll smoke it myself
