**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Endshpil]**  
Here, on a thin line, I piled up the house of that, about that  
How a ton of underground rap year after year  
Here, on broken evil, modestly shod  
After smoking, he realized it wasn’t tasted  
For a long time, like a wolf, he wandered here and there  
Rap critics said this sound isn’t a hook  
It’s different, my friend — it’s like a pack of bitches  
Whoever drops it wildly will unleash waves of torment  

**[Bridge: Endshpil]**  
I’m ready to drown your fears in these texts  
Let me, let me lay down fat on the beats  
This is my flava, we’re loud on the beat  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits hard — it’s a hit  

**[Chorus: Endshpil]**  
It’s a hit  
The track hits hard — it’s a hit  
It’s a hit  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits hard — it’s a hit  

**[Verse 2: Miyagi]**  
We added some groove, at the dacha it got better  
Flowers of the fields, pour water, Miyagi stuff — boom — and into the VIP room  
Bullets in the magazine, no censorship, just like no conscience  
Bodies and forms shake in search  
Nothing to stay overnight, we’re adding groove for you  
A pile of money spent, the guys are wasted today  
Veil, veil, veil — smoke enveloped me  
Miyagi confidently lays it down, we pound, pound, pound  

**[Pre-Chorus: Miyagi]**  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  

**[Chorus: Miyagi & Endshpil]**  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits hard — it’s a hit  

**[Outro: Endshpil]**  
It’s a hit  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits hard — it’s a hit
