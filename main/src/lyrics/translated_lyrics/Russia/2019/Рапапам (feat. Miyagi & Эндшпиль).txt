**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Endshpil & Miyagi]  
(La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)  
Yeah, mmm  
(La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la)  
Yeah  

[Verse 1: Endshpil]  
I’ll drop my backpack, tired from the road,  
Muddles, leeches, bass kids, codes.  
The stone forest will welcome me, and it’s so nice,  
It’ll pierce my chest with a pleasant sting.  
Common measures, I’m not bound by them, calming my nerves to the beat,  
I know this city by heart, it sleeps without lights.  
An eternal repeat drives my race car, let’s sing and let’s do it without offense.  
You know, the cup of love is full — it needs to be drunk.  
With strong knots, on long roads,  
We’re running away from problems, and they can’t find us.  
A dream let me hug you, I’m spinning these thoughts, give me five.  
Trust the guy, the young rapper, I sing from the heart, and you know I love.  
Those lovely eyes bloom like crazy,  
Roses drip from you, I’ve started to believe in miracles.  
I began everything from scratch, get lost, demon.  
Take it as it is, heavenly weight.  
This velvet high, life there, lie my nigga, this is paradise, I’m a bad boy high.  
Puddles underfoot are no obstacle,  
Mom, I’ve learned to fly, and with you, everything’s just fine.  

[Chorus: Miyagi & Endshpil]  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  

[Verse 2: Miyagi]  
Mmm, away with the megapolis shine, I want my home,  
Where, among mountains, rivers, and trees, there’s crackling.  
Friends lit a fire — that’s love.  
How long can I last without you, my Motherland?  
From Adam’s apple to the memories of life,  
There was no dirt, just peace with the world until dark.  
We ran, scraped our knees, rejoiced fully in kindness.  
Time, take me back to where we were carefree,  
Let me enjoy where smiles are endless.  
In black-and-white photos, kids, school days,  
We loved life from night till morning (from night till morning).  
Home upside down, and a tsunami of freedom through garages,  
Kids whizzing through the yards with a whistle.  
How sad that we grew up,  
Only warm sadness will remain in my heart, warm sadness.  

[Chorus: Miyagi & Endshpil]  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la (La-la)  
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la  

[Verse 3: 9 Grams]  
On the speedometer, two hundred, we’re together, an intersection into the abyss, loudly with a song.  
And the wind through the windows, the world feels so tight, again between balances.  
Gouache brochures, streets, buildings, heightened feelings, slowed breathing.  
Babylon will fall, forgotten by God, buried in ruins, so much evil.  
I’ll lie on the ground, close my eyes, mother’s hands, father’s voice.  
Children’s smiles, her scent, that’s what’s dearest to me.  
I’ll delete my account with habits for a bet, erase contacts and throw away my passport.  
For breakfast: air, tobacco, mint, walking to freedom, barefoot on asphalt.  
Worn out feet, outrunning shadows, past animals, people, and plants.  
Racing against the infinite universe
