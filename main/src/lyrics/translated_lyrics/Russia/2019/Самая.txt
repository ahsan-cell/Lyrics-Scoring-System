**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Amigo]**  
An avalanche follows an avalanche, purple dreams from codeine  
Girl of pain, girl of love, the strongest kind of cinema  
You are my greater half, troubles, stains, storms pass us by  
We soar, and the sky sings to us in diamonds, check it out, babe  
My love for you is invisibly visible  
Or visibly invisible, translate me, babe  
I step out with love steaming from my mouth  
Freedom is a phantom, there’s no warmth for me without you  
Let’s ride on a comet, let’s try to flip this world  
Somewhere on the shore of the Universe, we’re like jewels flowing  
And it’s all spring’s fault, this love and sleepless nights  
I’m for you, you’re for me — a whole world, just hold my hand, babe  
I sing to you about how much I love you  
Dream girl, I’ll drown in you  
And before I sink like a stone  
Love you, love you, love you  

**[Chorus: Miyagi & Endshpil]**  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies (And)  

**[Verse 2: Endshpil]**  
I walk barefoot in the rain with you, being a vagabond  
Essentially drained, but who knows what awaits us next?  
This world is prickly to the point of pain  
A painful life story, I’m searching for Dory  
Lighthouse, show me the haven of my strange love  
Curls in the smoke, I’m floating, girl, catch me  
This setup is for you, and whoever’s thoughts warmed  
I broke my knees so these songs could be sung  
Love on the pair, dollar, dollar on knives  
Long, long on beats, your favorite in verses  
Word pa-pa-pa-pa-pam, rapa-pa, Saddam-Adam  
I guess I won’t be with you — that’s what we need  
This jerk — it’s me, got the most potent data  
Without you, I’m a wreck, but with you, I’m flying, Exiled  
Come, come on, I promise to show you the whole world  
Let’s look a little further, and beyond — the whole world  

**[Chorus: Miyagi]**  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  

**[Verse 3: Miyagi]**  
The fog covered the city at home  
I was drawn to you, the road strictly followed my steps  
Just like that and forever, I’ll hide in the storerooms  
The dream girl, let’s turn the calendar page  
Half past four in the morning, and we sit at sunset (Where?)  
Diving headfirst into the depths of these embraces  
(How crazy I am about you, how crazy I am about you)  
Let’s split life in half, love — like a carousel, hold on tight  
And we’ll reach for the stars, smile, show yourself  
This fire can’t be extinguished, not a second to forget  
A love story — we’re like Mufasa and Sarabi  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  
Looking at you, I can’t believe my eyes  
I’m drowning in the beauty of your face  

**[Chorus: Miyagi]**  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  
The one and only, my very own  
Recruited by pheromones, you can’t describe you  
The one and only, my very own  
We’ll break free across the border, embrace the skies  
The one and
