**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Northern Walrus and Interviewer]**
- Love? I can't answer that...
- Why?
- I don't even know.
- Have you ever loved someone?
- Of course, I have.
- And do you love now?
- Not anymore.
- Why not?
- I got caught.
- How's that?
- Just like that! I had someone else.
- And your beloved girl was deeply hurt by that?
- Of course!
- And there's nothing that can change it?
- No.
- You could reach out to her again, and maybe she’ll see you and believe you.
- I don’t know. Will she believe me?
- Try.

**[Verse 1: Northern Walrus]**
Close your eyes, everything’s gradual, and no one can replace you here  
Morning will gift us this moment, and the cold outside is no hindrance  
While we’re here in our warm bed, hair flowing like waves on your neck  
The touches are tender and serene, it seems we’ve found  
What we’ve longed for  
Here, problems won’t find us, just you and me in this world  
Time will freeze at this moment, everything I have, I’ll give to you  
Fingers tightly intertwined, that’s all I need  
Ready to run after you to the ends of the earth, to  
Repeat it all anew once more.

**[Chorus: Northern Walrus]**  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us.

**[Verse 2: Crazy Bumblebee]**  
Your voice again, it’s like a lullaby  
I’ll hold you tight so it doesn’t get colder  
My jacket fits you so well  
And your eyes shine like reflections in NBA games  
I take a step towards you, to escape with you from everyone  
Under our feet, the Earth spins, today there’s a fire between us  
Who cares if there’s a blizzard outside - with kisses, it’s like candy  
The temperature’s like in hot Acapulco between us now.

**[Verse 3: Sir Carrot]**  
A night with you means we won’t sleep  
I take you, and professionally go for a walk  
I’ll wear my suit, you love mohair so much  
You found the wicked Sir among the meanest cheeses  
I’m causing a stir, you checkmate  
And you don’t even know our son doesn’t like chocolate  
He drinks bitter iodine for hours like a Walrus  
We look at him, and between us, the ice is melting.

**[Chorus: Crazy Bumblebee]**  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us  
Between us, the ice is melting, let’s hope no one finds us now  
We’ll get soaked in the rain, and today it’s just the two of us.

**[Outro: Crazy Bumblebee and Northern Walrus]**  
Just the two of us, just the two of us, it’s only us  
Just the two of us, it’s only us, we’re here just the two of us.
