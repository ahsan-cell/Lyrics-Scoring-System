**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: T-Fest]  
(Lambada, we dance at the bar all day)  
(I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me)  
(Lambada, we dance at the bar all day) But-no  
(I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me) It’s Ti, on sound-sound, wow  

[Verse 1: T-Fest]  
I’m undressing the girl completely, ah  
I’ve never seen her equipment before  
She wants to drink, wants passion fruit  
And I want her, if I want, then I will (Ah-ow)  
Every day is a celebration  
She says my gaze teases her  
Again she’ll boil over in wild ecstasy  
I’m in her field, I’m making my move, but from behind, yeah (Wow)  
“Do it every day” — that’s my motto  
I’m clearing out their stars, making the sky clean  
All your bling has long been out of our league  
You’ll be surprised, but we’re all good — no need to talk  
I got ninety-nine problems  
But under all this fire — no, I’m not melting  
You’re so tender, but to you, I’m a cactus  
Bitches expect that one day I’ll chill out, no  

[Bridge: T-Fest]  
No, no, no, no  
No, no, no, no (Oh)  
No, no, no, no  
No, no, no  

[Chorus: T-Fest]  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  

[Interlude: Скриптонит]  
— Ha-ha-ha  
— So what the hell are you all doing here?  
— They’re going to dance  
— Don’t touch, you’re annoying  
— Come on, come on, come on, come on  
— They’re going to dance  
— Let me through. Get out of here, damn it  

[Verse 2: Скриптонит]  
I’m a Ronin for the vultures above her, yeah  
My sword is on fire  
Money in the air — rain, we’re like Jews  
There are candies in the bag, but they’re not for kids  
Happy holidays, bitches (Bitches). I’m here for an hour, maybe three  
I’ll pull out my pipe, and we’ll end up inside this bitch  
Just look at her, she thinks there’s no money  
Here, take a pack, wipe that ass of this bitch, ha-ha-ha  
What do they think of themselves? (What?)  
You’ll sleep at home, go shake that ass  
Out of my kitchen — get lost  
Hey, Ti, show them how it’s done  

[Chorus: T-Fest]  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me  
Lambada, we dance at the bar all day  
I’m close, but I still haven’t seen you on me
