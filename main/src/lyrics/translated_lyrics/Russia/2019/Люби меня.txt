**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Endshpil]  
M-m-m, na-na-na  
Y-e-e-e-e  
M-m-m, and  

[Verse 1: Endshpil]  
Sunlight glimmers, dawns and mists  
Mama, heal my open wounds  
Here, the fragile spring fills with cold  
In loving embraces, manna, I am all of it  
Sadness washes over the city, where to hide?  
In the neighborhood, we legalize, and we don’t care  
These skins from the province — lust of sins  
I hide my thoughts from the local cats  
It's a wonderful life, sunshine  
Mountains of positivity smoke these lines on an empty stomach  
I dive into her hips, eyes in the clouds  
Why does no one ask to join the planet of kindness?  
She hasn’t gathered any cash or good  
We need little napalm, plenty in hand  
Broke it down on the strings, neither la-la-la, nor na-na  
On the bagpipes, they say, another shooting begins  

[Bridge: Endshpil]  
Under the feeling of "love," all doors will open for her  
In games, everyone has long wanted her  
We’ll hide our hands in hands, troublemakers, get out  
This is my life, and I’m uplifted by it  
Under the feeling of "love," all doors will open for her  
In games, everyone has long wanted her  
We’ll hide our hands in hands, troublemakers, get out  
This is my life, and I’m uplifted by it  

[Chorus: Miyagi]  
Love me, darling, bear with me  
Darling, forgive me for being a mess  
(M-m, I can’t carry a drop of your tears)  
Love me, darling, bear with me  
Darling, forgive me for being a mess  
(M-m, I can’t carry a drop of your te-ears)  

[Verse 2: Miyagi]  
At the same time, freedom with the wind, clouds drifted  
My cherished dream led me, saying: "Don’t blink"  
Surely everything will be as it should — hands to the heavens  
And the sea drowned me within, drawing interest  
And in the sight of your eyes, I reveal the notes of phrases  
I bet it’s not in vain that the melody lured us  
Not in vain that the melody lured us  
Love fed us with kisses, catch it in advance  
Minimum — it’s passion, and I’m ready to get lost in you  
And stars fell from the sky into the abyss, we followed them, breaking  
Into thousands of pieces (Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go)  
From unfamiliar faces (Far away, far away, far away)  
They called with sacred beacons, miracles  
I’m ready to punish this whole world for you  
And past our windows, mirages drifted again  
Cherish this moment!  

[Chorus: Miyagi]  
Love me, darling, bear with me  
Darling, forgive me for being a mess  
(M-m, I can’t carry a drop of your tears)  
Love me, darling, bear with me  
Darling, forgive me for being a mess  
(M-m, I can’t carry a drop of your te-ears)  

[Verse 3: Symptom]  
I’m on thin ice with you outside  
With you outside, yeah, yeah  
I’m on thin ice with you outside  
We’re not to blame, bear with me like before  
Let’s stay in memory in these photographs  
And we don’t need more air to breathe  
My city is a trap, and I’ve fallen into it  
There are so few chances to remain human here  
I’ll take my own and head back  
To where we were meant for each other  
I believe in a colorful world where we are invincible  
But on that side, love is far from a motive  
We’ll turn inside out, inside out, inside out  
Our stone world (Boom!), in which we burn  

[Bridge: Symptom]  
Just hold my hand (Hold my hand), and I’m with you here on thin ice  
Just hold my hand (Hold my hand), while I’m sinking down  
Just hold my hand (Hold my hand), and I’m with you here on thin ice  
Just hold my hand (Hold my hand), while I’m sinking down  

[Chorus: Miyagi]  
Love me, darling, bear with me  
Darling, forgive me for being a mess  
(M-m, I can’t carry a drop of your tears)  
Love me, darling, bear with me  
Darling, forgive me for being a mess  
(M-m, I can’t carry a drop of your te-ears)  

[Outro: Miyagi
