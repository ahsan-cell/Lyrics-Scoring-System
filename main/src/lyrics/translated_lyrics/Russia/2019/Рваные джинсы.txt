**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Sayonara boy  
Sayonara boy  

[Chorus]  
Baby, you love ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  
Baby, you love ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  

[Verse 1]  
Baby, your eyes, your dreads  
The people around us — just skeletons  
I want you even when you're dressed  
Being like us — so forbidden  
In your loft, you-you-you-you in my sweater  
Pics-pics-pics-pics-pics, if we’re at a party  
Our favorite sneakers stomp together  
We chew mint gum to one of my songs  

[Chorus]  
Baby, you love ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  
Baby, you love ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-o, o-o-o!  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-o, o-o-o!  

[Verse 2]  
Girl — lollipop, an overdose of feelings  
I’m hooked on you, 'cause I want this  
And you do too (Too, too)  
Goosebumps run down my skin (Skin, skin)  
Eyes like glass  
In a glass, soda with berry syrup  
We’re overdosing, don’t call the cops  
In a glass, soda with berry syrup  
We’re overdosing, don’t call the cops  

[Chorus]  
Baby, you love ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  
Baby, you love ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-very ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-o, o-o-o!  
O-o-o-o-o-o, very ripped jeans  
O-o-o-o-o-o, o-o-o!  

[Outro]  
Sayonara boy-boy-boy-boy-boy  
Sayonara boy
