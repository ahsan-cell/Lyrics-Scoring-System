**[Intro]**  
For hours we gaze at each other, like people from another dimension  
In the long nights, wild passion disregarded all limitations  
The laws of physics can't reveal the principles of our attraction  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  

**[Chorus]**  
You, like a whole universe, you, like a whole universe  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  
You, like a whole universe, you, like a whole universe  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  

**[Verse]**  
My baby, come a little closer  
I want to hear how softly you breathe  
Whispering in my ear, or maybe somewhere lower  
But wait, hold on, quieter, quieter, quieter  
Good news  
Judging by the tracks, we’ve become the couple of the year  
Girls see an ideal in me  
Can you imagine someone sees an ideal in me, damn  
But you see a beloved rascal  
A big belly and a very tough character  
Cold moods in a confusing state  
Always with my unreasonable buddies  
Your friends screamed that I’m unnecessary  
Pressing on the fact that I’m not handsome  
But you love me not for my muscles  
But for my actions in life and my ability to think  
I have cash, get yourself a new dress  
I have cash, buy an expensive ring  
I have cash, spend it, spend it, spend it  
For you’ve always been by my side  
Even when there was no money or dresses  
No expensive gifts or rings  
When you were my only wealth  
Yes, it’s still the same, just now we have some dough  
And I don’t mind spending ink on poems  
I don’t mind admitting I’ve drifted beyond the buoys  
Again I’m drowning in the mirror of your very sweet soul  
Your tides of love will warm me  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
For hours we gaze at each other, like people from another dimension  
In the long nights, wild passion disregarded all limitations  
The laws of physics can't reveal the principles of our attraction  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  

**[Chorus]**  
You, like a whole universe, you, like a whole universe  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  
You, like a whole universe, you, like a whole universe  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  
You, like a whole universe, you, like a whole universe  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe  
You, like a whole universe, you, like a whole universe  
For the depth of your soul is to my heart, like a whole universe
