[Intro: MOLLY & EGOR KRID]  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same (This is Egor Krid)  

[Verse 1: EGOR KRID & Both]  
With you, I can’t find control  
Now, I’ll send my love home to sober up  
It’s not worth it  
These are rumors, I’m not like that, don’t believe  
But sometimes those bitches break down the door (Oh, no)  
But how could you, but how could you  
Strip all our feelings bare?  
Saying the same words to someone else: “Blah-blah-blah!” (Ha-ha)  
But I know that without me  
You don’t want, want, want, want  
And we can’t be together  
And this song will be for you  

[Chorus: MOLLY & Both]  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  

[Verse 2: MOLLY & Both]  
I’ll kiss you long and deep  
Then we can forget everything  
You pricked me with a needle  
Leaving no rights  
And not now, like in the sky  
Sky, sky, sky, I look into your eyes  
I didn’t love them at night  
But someone else did for me!  
If I’m in someone else’s arms  
Remember what you said back then  
Better you don’t forgive, it pounds in my temples  
But I know that without me  
You don’t want, want, want, want  
And we can’t be together  
And this song will be for you  

[Chorus: EGOR KRID & Both]  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  

[Outro: MOLLY, EGOR KRID & Both]  
MOLLY  
Okay  
Uh-huh  
I, I  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same  
If you don’t love me, then I don’t either  
If you forget me, then I’ll do the same
