**[Chorus]**  
My dream is to pluck a star, to give it to you, so it lights your way  
If I don’t return again, lost in the twilight, wandering astray  
I’m trying to make this dream come true  
My dream is to pluck a star, to give it to you, so it lights your way  
If I don’t return again, lost in the twilight, wandering astray  
I’m trying to make this dream come true  

**[Verse]**  
You, like a sleepy essence  
You, as if from a dream  
You leave no doubt that soon you won’t be mine  
I’ve brought you so little joy  
I’ve asked so little, “How are you?”  
I wanted a bright future, to forget the present  
That’s my misfortune, but what can I do?  

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t go to sleep, stay with me just a little longer  
I’ll search in your eyes, while there’s still meaning in them  
Don’t go to sleep, stay with me just a little longer  
I’ll search in your eyes, while there’s still meaning...  

**[Chorus]**  
My dream is to pluck a star, to give it to you, so it lights your way  
If I don’t return again, lost in the twilight, wandering astray  
I’m trying to make this dream come true  
My dream is to pluck a star, to give it to you, so it lights your way  
If I don’t return again, lost in the twilight, wandering astray  
I’m trying to make this dream come true
