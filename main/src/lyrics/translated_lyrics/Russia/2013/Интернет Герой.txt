**[Verse 1]**  
In my spring, you appeared  
And you say you've fallen hard...  
I feel it all!  
You love the camera and the flashes  
And there are always flings around you  
Just like in a silly movie!

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Spreading your wings, you're not a stranger to me  
Just answer me this question

**[Chorus]**  
Would you stay with me, breaking your peace?  
Wouldn't I be an internet hero? Wouldn't I be an internet hero?  
Would you stay with me, breaking your peace?  
Wouldn't I be an internet hero? Wouldn't I be an internet hero?

**[Verse 2]**  
When I'm with you, I lose myself  
What will tomorrow bring for us â€“ I don't know  
I'm burning alone  
But you have a crowd of friends  
Who loves whom, and who isn't a friend...  
No need for that! It's foolish!

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Spreading your wings, you're not a stranger to me  
Just answer me this question

**[Chorus]**  
Would you stay with me, breaking your peace?  
Wouldn't I be an internet hero? Wouldn't I be an internet hero?  
Would you stay with me, breaking your peace?  
Wouldn't I be an internet hero? Wouldn't I be an internet hero?  
Would you stay with me?
