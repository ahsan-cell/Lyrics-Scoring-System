**Translated Lyrics:**

Two unequal halves are arguing within me  
Choose for yourself, my love, darkness or light  
Just five more seconds of silence, and I’ll be gone  
In this universe  
Choose for yourself, my love, darkness or light  
But they are indivisible, there’s no choice  
This is not silence at all, it’s an answer  
And it remains unchanged  

[Pre-Chorus: Erika & Nastya]  
And you and I argue, who’s right, who’s to blame  
Interrupt me mid-sentence, ah  

[Chorus: Nu Virgos (VIA Gra)]  
And I want a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
Who am I in this world without you?  
Tell me how it feels inside  
To reconcile the two halves of my soul  
And I want a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
Who am I in this world without you?  
Tell me how it feels inside  
To reconcile the two halves of my soul  

[Verse 2: Nastya & Misha]  
How about we lift this ban together?  
There are no guilty or innocent among us  
Do you want me to reveal the main secret?  
Or would you rather not?  
Two unequal halves are arguing within me  
Choose for yourself, my love, darkness or light  
This is not silence at all, it’s an answer  
Without ellipses  

[Pre-Chorus: Erika & Nastya]  
And you and I argue, who’s right, who’s to blame  
Interrupt me mid-sentence, ah  

[Chorus: Nu Virgos (VIA Gra)]  
And I want a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
Who am I in this world without you?  
Tell me how it feels inside  
To reconcile the two halves of my soul  
And I want a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
Who am I in this world without you?  
Tell me how it feels inside  
To reconcile the two halves of my soul  

[Bridge: Nu Virgos (VIA Gra)]  
And I ask for a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
And I ask for a truce  

[Chorus: Nu Virgos (VIA Gra)]  
And I want a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
Who am I in this world without you?  
Tell me how it feels inside  
To reconcile the two halves of my soul  
And I want a truce  
And I ask for a truce  
Who am I in this world without you?  
Tell me how it feels inside  
To reconcile the two halves of my soul  

[Outro: Nastya]  
And I want a truce
