**[Verse 1]**  
I don’t know how to live if you leave  
I don’t know how to keep believing in better days  
Something needs to be decided, between us only lies  
We seem to be together, yet we feel so alone  
I’m training myself to be apart from you  
Without unnecessary sorrow and without sweet flattery  

**[Chorus]**  
Take this sky away, take the paradise too  
Take this sun away, I know how to be strong  
Just know that when you say "Goodbye" to me...  
This sky won’t be blue like my eyes anymore  
This sun will explode, shatter into pieces...  
And even the birds will fall silent. And even the birds will fall silent  

**[Verse 2]**  
It’s hard for me with you, it’s hard without you  
But it’s time for us to part and dot the "i"s  
I thought I was lucky, as if just to spite  
And the time has come to walk away from you  
I want to forget this feeling forever  
But it seems that saying goodbye is an art as well  

**[Chorus]**  
Take this sky away, take the paradise too  
Take this sun away, I know how to be strong  
Just know that when you say "Goodbye" to me...  
This sky won’t be blue like my eyes anymore  
This sun will explode, shatter into pieces...  
And even the birds will fall silent. And even the birds will fall silent  
Take it away  
Take this sky away, take the paradise too  
Take this sun away, I know how to be strong  
Just know that when you say "Goodbye" to me...  
This sky won’t be blue like my eyes anymore  
This sun will explode, shatter into pieces...  
And even the birds will fall silent. And even the birds will fall silent
