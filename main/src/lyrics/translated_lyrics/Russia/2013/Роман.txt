**Translated Lyrics:**

Once upon a time  
We will still answer for everything  
And the paper castle  
Beautiful, but believe me, it’s not the same  
And the fact that I’m losing my soul in you  
And that I believe your words  
And that I love you and hate you  
But I breathe you in  

**[Chorus]**  
And I will write a beautiful novel about you  
In which I will stay with you  
Where I won’t give you to anyone  
You’re mine, only mine  
And for now, it doesn’t matter what comes next  
It doesn’t matter what was before us  
We don’t need to think about anything  
The whole world is ours right now  

**[Verse 2]**  
Once upon a time  
You might quietly pass by  
Sunrises, sunsets  
You won’t remember and you’ll look away  
You’ll forget that I lost my soul in you  
And believed your words  
But for now, let’s break  
All that is forbidden to us  

**[Chorus]**  
And I will write a beautiful novel about you  
In which I will stay with you  
Where I won’t give you to anyone  
You’re mine, only mine  
And for now, it doesn’t matter what comes next  
It doesn’t matter what was before us  
We don’t need to think about anything  
The whole world is ours right now  

**[Chorus]**  
And I will write a beautiful novel about you  
In which I will stay with you  
Where I won’t give you to anyone  
You’re mine, only mine  
And for now, it doesn’t matter what comes next  
It doesn’t matter what was before us  
We don’t need to think about anything  
The whole world is ours right now
