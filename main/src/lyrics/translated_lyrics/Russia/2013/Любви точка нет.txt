**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: DOROFEEVA]  
I lift my thoughts from the ground  
And in my memory, I caress you  
And that fire we ignited together  
Still burns fiercely in my soul  
It consumes me from within  
Turning my heart to ashes  
And that fire we lit together  
In my soul never fades away  

[Verse 1: DOROFEEVA]  
Without you, I’m simply dying  
I miss your love so much  
I’ll drive myself insane, oh-oh, ah-ah  
A lump in my throat and tears on my lashes  
We can only dream of each other  
I’ll drive myself insane, oh-oh, ah-ah  

[Pre-Chorus: DOROFEEVA]  
The golden autumn won’t mend my wounds  
And winter tightens its grip with frost  

[Chorus: DOROFEEVA & Pozitiv]  
There’s no point in love, love is gone, that’s it  
The curtains are drawn, and the lights are out  
There’s no point in love, I’m not waiting for a call  
I don’t believe in love, there’s no point in love  
There’s no point in love (No-no-no-no-no-no-no)  
There’s no point in love (No-no-no-no-no-no-no)  
There’s no point in love (No-no-no-no-no-no-no)  

[Verse 2: DOROFEEVA]  
Without your love, I’m gasping for air  
I can’t forget, no matter how hard I try  
I’ll drive myself insane, oh-oh, ah-ah  
My heart aches, and my soul is troubled  
Let me go, I beg you for God’s sake  
I’ll drive myself insane, oh-oh, ah-ah  

[Pre-Chorus: DOROFEEVA & Pozitiv]  
The golden autumn won’t mend my wounds  
And winter tightens its grip with frost  
I will never forget the warmth of your gentle hands  
I don’t want to believe that our time has run out  

[Chorus: DOROFEEVA & Pozitiv]  
There’s no point in love, love is gone, that’s it  
The curtains are drawn, and the lights are out  
There’s no point in love, I’m not waiting for a call  
I don’t believe in love, there’s no point in love  
There’s no point in love, love is gone, that’s it  
The curtains are drawn, and the lights are out  
There’s no point in love, I’m not waiting for a call  
I don’t believe in love, there’s no point in love  

[Refrain: DOROFEEVA]  
No love, no love  
No love, there’s no point in love  
No love, no love  
No love, there’s no point in love  
There’s no point in love (No-no-no-no-no-no-no)  
No love, there’s no point in love  
There’s no point in love (No-no-no-no-no-no-no)  
I don’t believe in love, there’s no point in love
