**Translated Lyrics:**

In your palms, the sun shines bright,  
Burning with a fierce delight.  
The sky above me laughs and plays,  
So much happiness, it sways.  

You're the only one in this world,  
From your love, I feel unfurled.  
I chase you like the wind does fly,  
In the clouds, together we rise high.  

**[Chorus]**  
Take me to that place,  
Where orange dreams embrace,  
In a hot dance till the dawn,  
Whispers of love carry on.  
Take me to that place,  
Where spring forever stays,  
And winter never comes our way.  

**[Verse 2]**  
All my thoughts are filled with you,  
And my dreams, theyâ€™re all so true.  
You and I race across the sky,  
Drunk on love, we soar up high.  

**[Chorus]**  
Take me to that place,  
Where orange dreams embrace,  
In a hot dance till the dawn,  
Whispers of love carry on.  
Take me to that place,  
Where spring forever stays,  
And winter never comes our way.  

**[Bridge]**  
Take me to that place,  
Where orange dreams embrace,  
In a hot dance till the dawn,  
Whispers of love carry on.  
Take me to that place,  
Where spring forever stays,  
And winter never comes our way.  

**[Chorus]**  
Take me to that place,  
Where orange dreams embrace,  
In a hot dance till the dawn,  
Whispers of love carry on.  
Take me to that place,  
Where spring forever stays,  
And winter never comes our way.  
Take me to that place,  
Where orange dreams embrace,  
In a hot dance till the dawn,  
Whispers of love carry on.  
Take me to that place,  
Where spring forever stays,  
And winter never comes our way.
