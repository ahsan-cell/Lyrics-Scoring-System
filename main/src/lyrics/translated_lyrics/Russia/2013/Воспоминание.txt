**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Bridge 1]**  
You won't be able to forget!  
You won't be able to forget!  
You won't be able to forget!  

**[Verse 1]**  
You hide the raw details  
As if we don’t know each other at all  
We crossed paths of independence  
I smile in the face of fate  
We both dove into this sky  
Neither of us had been on the roof before  
We shared hundreds of memories  
And I always believed in you  

**[Chorus]**  
I am now your memory  
Maybe I was a message to you  
You won’t be able to forget me  
You can’t forget, you can’t forget!  

**[Bridge 2]**  
You won't be able to forget!  

**[Verse 2]**  
Now miles separate us  
And I’ve gone again to seek answers  
But I remember everything that was between us  
And I’ll never forget it  
It hurts so much to leave scars on the heart  
But there was no deceit in these feelings  
We made it through, and now we’re stronger  
You’ll forever be in my heart  

**[Chorus 2]**  
I am now your memory  
Maybe I was a message to you  
You won’t be able to forget me  
You can’t forget, you can’t forget!  
I am now your memory (ooh-ooh-ooh)  
Maybe I was a message to you (ooh-yeah)  
You won’t be able to forget me (you can’t forget me)  
You can’t forget, you can’t forget!  

**[Bridge 2]**  
You won't be able to forget!  
I am now a memory!  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah  
Na-na-na-na  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-na-na  
Da-da-dam, yeah-oh-yeah-hey  

**[Chorus]**  
I am now your memory  
Maybe I was a message to you  
You won’t be able to forget me  
You can’t forget, you can’t forget!  

**[Outro]**  
You won't be able to forget!  
You won't be able to forget!
