**[Intro]**  
Another reality  
Another, another, another, another  
Another reality  
Another, another, another, another  

**[Chorus]**  
Another reality, another height  
Under a crystal sky - you and I  
In tangled thoughts, idiots for three days  
Aliens - you and I  

**[Verse 1]**  
Aliens in parallel desires  
We open our arms, melting, suspended in space  
Days, weeks, even years we conquer at night  
It's different, I know, a parallel breath  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I have you, and I'm not afraid  
We breathe in sobs, gripping our wrists  
I have you, and it's strange  
What I didn't know before about happiness  

**[Chorus]**  
Another reality, another height  
Under a crystal sky - you and I  
In tangled thoughts, idiots for three days  
Aliens - you and I  

**[Verse 2]**  
Quiet confessions. We soar with a touch  
And without noticing spring, we engage in love  
We share secrets, forgetting the distances  
It's different, I know, a parallel breath  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I have you, and I'm not afraid  
We breathe in sobs, gripping our wrists  
I have you, and it's strange  
What I didn't know before about happiness  

**[Chorus]**  
Another reality, another height  
Under a crystal sky - you and I  
In tangled thoughts, idiots for three days  
Aliens - you and I  

**[Bridge]**  
I have you, and I'm not afraid  
We breathe in sobs, gripping our wrists  
I have you, and it's strange  
What I didn't know before about happiness  

**[Chorus]**  
Another reality, another height  
Under a crystal sky - you and I  
In tangled thoughts, idiots for three days  
Aliens - you and I
