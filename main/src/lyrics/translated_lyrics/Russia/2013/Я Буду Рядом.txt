**[Intro: Niksenn]**  
Niksenn's free now, screw your feelings  
No matter what they say, Niksenn's a real RockStar  

**[Chorus: Niksenn]**  
A drink + Baby on my table right now  
I’m gasping, but not from smoke, it’s the girl on my face right now  
I exhale all the smoke into her hole  
Her pussy smokes like exhaust, let’s go  
We’re like cars, two machines for sex here  
There’s smoke from Charon - it’s sex with a haze (Way)  

**[Verse: Niksenn]**  
I’m taking gold, I’m taking this year  
I know what to do now to make it more clear  
I know what to keep for myself  
I know what to give to you  
I know that once I was at the bottom, but now I’m on top  

**[Verse 2: Niksenn]**  
I won’t lie now, acting all brave  
Still afraid of the dark, but that’s not the point I crave  
This summer I saved my girl when she was drowning  
A true Hero in water, he’s here, damn (Hola! Hola!)  
Bang! Bang! These are Bad Bars  
I’ll smash the charts, I’ll smash you  
She says I’m Broke  
But at least I’m not Alone  
Yeah, yeah, I’m out again  
Brought out feelings, but I tricked her again  
I don’t need these stupid girls  
Who drop their hands for cash right away  

**[Chorus: Niksenn]**  
A drink + Baby on my table right now  
I’m gasping, but not from smoke  
It’s the girl on my face right now  

**[Verse 3: Niksenn]**  
Started buying into the pink style, but I’m not Lovv  
Girl’s a bomb, but not from ISIS  
I’ve been drinking since childhood, but not T-Killah  
I’m no fool - and that’s my strength  
The strength is that I’m not alone now  
My brother’s beside me, my Family’s around  
I don’t judge guys for their nicknames by surname  
With imagination, it’s not sweet, then there’s no sense in the industry  

**[Outro: Niksenn]**  
CB+ Flow, get lost, please  
I don’t know what to say to you  
Damn, I’m so-de-pend-ent  
CB+
