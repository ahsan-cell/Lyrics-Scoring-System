**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I want to remember how the bed was rumpled,  
How you dress there, in the dark,  
How you leave like a ghost, silently, without saying goodbye.  
We’ve finished our novel about love,  
Just a couple of words are missing.  
Stay with me, talk to me.  
I want to remember how the snow falls,  
Slower than usual, the snow falls,  
How the soul wanders naked through the room.  
Soon the echo of a new day will sound,  
Start it without me.  
Don’t wake me, set me free.

[Chorus]  
The show is over — the lights go out,  
And there are no more ellipses.  
Stop the music...  
The show is over — happy end.

[Verse 2]  
I will be the way you didn’t want,  
I’ll do with others what you couldn’t.  
I’ll tear the last threads between us,  
Wiping my wet eyes with my hand.  
I ask you, my ex,  
Stay with me, talk to me!

[Chorus]  
The show is over — the lights go out,  
And there are no more ellipses.  
Stop the music...  
The show is over — happy end.

[Bridge]  
The show is over — the lights go out,  
And there are no more ellipses.  
Stop the music...  
The show is over — happy end.

[Chorus]  
The show is over — the lights go out,  
And there are no more ellipses.  
Stop the music...  
The show is over — happy end.
