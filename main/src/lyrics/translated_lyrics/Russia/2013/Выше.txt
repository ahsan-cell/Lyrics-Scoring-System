**Translated Lyrics:**

Oooo~ oooo~  
Oooo~ oooo~  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’ll hide my wings so I won’t scare you,  
I’ll be so strong to protect you.  
I’ll hide my fears so you’ll never know,  
I’ll be so strong that you’ll love me so.  

**[Chorus]**  
I want to fly even higher, so I won’t touch the city’s rooftops,  
I want to be even closer and higher and higher,  
And higher...  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’re the speed of my thoughts, I can’t catch up to you,  
You’re near, you’re so close, but I can’t reach you.  
You’ve hidden, you’ve stolen, my heart is yours forever,  
I’ll get closer to you, I’ll learn how to fly.  

**[Chorus]**  
I want to fly even higher (even higher), so I won’t touch the city’s rooftops (won’t touch the rooftops),  
I want to be even closer (aaa~) and higher (higher) and higher.  
I want to fly even higher, so I won’t touch the city’s rooftops (city’s rooftops~),  
I want to be even closer (oh-oh-oh yeah) and higher and higher.  

**[Bridge]**  
Oooooo~  
Oooooo~ (yeah~)  
Ta-da-ta-da-ta-da-dam, ta-da-ta-da-ta-da-dam (Oooooo~)  
Ta-da-ta-da-ta-da-dam, ta-da-ta-da-ta-da-dam (Oooooo~)  

**[Transition]**  
Oooooo~ (even higher) Oooooo~ (fly higher)  
Oooooo~ (and higher) Oooooo~ (ooooo yeah)  

**[Chorus]**  
I want to fly even higher (higher~), so I won’t touch the city’s rooftops,  
I want to be even closer and higher and higher (ooooo~)  
And-and-and higher,  
Oh oh oh oh and higher.
