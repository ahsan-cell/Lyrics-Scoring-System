**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I was surprised  
To see you there at the end of the alley  
I've stopped loving you  
Yet how beautiful you are  
I've changed  
You've grown up and become even bolder  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You approached like a hero  
In silent black-and-white films  
And my heart raced so strongly because of it  

[Chorus]  
Don't believe me anymore  
Don't believe me anymore  
It can't be more beautiful  
Than it already is  
Don't believe me anymore  
As I open the envelope  
Forgive me for my answer  
And still, it's "no"  

[Verse 2]  
The answers are the same  
To your very same questions  
But you're so gentle  
That I would probably say "yes" already  
You're inevitable  
Your embrace is like steel cables  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You rolled in like fog  
And the clouds drifted low  
And your lips were so close to mine  

[Chorus]  
Don't believe me anymore  
Don't believe me anymore  
It can't be more beautiful  
Than it already is  
Don't believe me anymore  
As I open the envelope  
Forgive me for my answer...  
Don't believe me anymore  
Don't believe me anymore  
It can't be more beautiful  
Than it already is  
Don't believe me anymore  
As I open the envelope  
Forgive me for my answer  
And still, it's "no"  

[Chorus]  
Don't believe me anymore  
Don't believe me anymore  
It can't be more beautiful  
Than it already is  
Don't believe me anymore  
As I open the envelope  
Forgive me for my answer  
And still, it's "no"  
And still, it's "no"  
And still, it's "no"  

[Outro]  
And still, it's "no"
