**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part 1]**

**[Verse 1: Shinkaku]**  
Yeah, the snow has fallen, and we've been waiting for a miracle for quite a while  
Yeah, a kilogram of mandarins is enough for us, there are plenty on the table  
Hey, I won't write a gift list — I don't believe in your miracle  
Uh, and right now on the eve, no stylist — I'm like Baby "Uzi" Pluto  
Uh, I've got so much Olivier that it’s impossible to count  
Yeah, at night my crew drinks about 5 liters, like it's alcohol  
I can't believe it, but it's already 11 PM — that's for sure  
Now the clock will strike 12, and we'll make our toasts together  

**[Bridge: SAUCEGARDEN]**  
Snow outside, we sit together  
Ice in my soul, I haven't become more famous  
Fireplace by the wall, Christmas tree, decorations  
Frost, forgive me, I won't be more obedient  
Snow outside, we sit together  
Ice in my soul, I haven't become more famous  
Fireplace by the wall, Christmas tree, decorations  
Frost, forgive me, I won't be more obedient  

**[Verse 2: ArcticGorilla]**  
A new day pours snow like  
A miracle is close  
And I hope, like  
The next dish  
Will surpass the last. It will peck  
In the hole of the soul's pond  
And the tail of the catch will surface  
The one that will leave the curves of guilt  
It will vanish, lie flat on the board's surface  
It will tell what your need is  
It will point out the value of your year  
It will show the transience of your path  
It will punish your being mine  
With its taste, which will make you howl  
Will give strength like an oak to sit at the table  
To eat and  
Forget everything  

**[Verse 3: Shinkaku]**  
To eat and forget, to drink and merge  
With all this water flowing under the moon  
And I see no sense, even the thought hangs  
Between us a spark, hey, between us winter, oh yeah  
And this falling star will show me the way  
To the further life, will reveal the essence  
Of this existence, where we wait for a feast and snow  
Where we live poorly, happily, and closely  

**[Hook: Artur Doyle]**  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Yeah, bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch ourselves  

**[Verse 4: Artur Doyle]**  
Verse, like soup, I cooked  
On the beat, piled a bunch of bitches  
Fuck the leaders  
Why are you sad, speak up  
Intelligentsia, capitalism  
Indulgence, we are savages  
For sins in this city, we will all burn  
Don't blame me for calling you a fool  
Glory to Ukraine, greetings to all  

**[Post-Verse: Artur Doyle]**  
Bitch, sleds  
Bitch, sleds  
Bitch, sleds  
Yeah, bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch ourselves  

**[Hook: Artur Doyle]**  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Yeah, bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch, ourselves  
Yeah, bitch, sleds  
We ride, bitch ourselves  

**[Verse 5: Vlad2D]**  
M, grr, prr, hr, po-po, pr-pr-r  
New Year, bitch  
Stole the Christmas trees, bitch  
Watched "Yolki," bitch  
Double cup, Pepsi in it, not lean, huh  
And here I got lazy, passing the baton to the next  
dEbb  

**[Verse 6: Shinkaku]**  
Picked up the flag and went further  
Piled a bit, ha, how else?  
Style calls me, I don't chase after it  
Hating somewhere, well, fuck it  
I didn't peek at "Yolki" — my nerves are more precious  
Young fool looks a bit more expensive  
Playing Minecraft — squares are my rhymes  
Thank God, they're not bricks, no beefs needed  

**[Verse 7: Artur Doyle]**  
Vegetarian rap
