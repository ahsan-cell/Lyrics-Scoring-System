**Translated Lyrics:**

Life is still like an hourglass glued to the table  
I catch myself giving without knowing what I’ll receive  
Trust in life keeps me on track  
Diving headfirst into the box of forgotten things  
Prize poodles on park money trees, rarely worth it  
Those with ambitions don’t ask for extra hours in the day  
But they learn to make the most of what’s there  
Here we move with swift steps, no hypochondriacs  
My eagerness caricatures Kurt Thybo for you  
In a world ruled by city robots  
Building blocks for the honest sound I stand for  
I sail in my own lake searching for answers  
Stuffing the plank with plastic populism and flashy goods  
Stood by what they’ve run from  
I’m not out of shape; you can stay in the same place and still move forward  
It gave us faith in the hardest honor diploma  
A verse hunter’s demon mastering perfection  
Bearer of chaos syndrome cured at the back of the school  
Time is money, so why not get value for every crown?  
Thoughtfulness shouldn’t be something to ponder  
Think empty thoughts about your sixty-inch tumor – fill up!  
Let’s think outside a new tangent right now  
Because it takes two to make a thought good  
We’re pieces in their industry board game  
Seconds tick-tock for a tactician  
My friends get lost in the same swing, going  
Into business, so why should I go that way?  
We must have it like the yolk in an egg when we waste knowledge  
It’s time to wash the waves against the current  
Those who dream live right on the heels of reality  
Those who live chase their dreams  
It’s right to spark debate, trained alphabet hackysack  
Since second grade, there was rap in Asterix’s trick magic drink  
No Prince Valiant plagiarism with swag and six-pack printed tight  
I don’t make tracks for your Friday lap dance and monkey that doesn’t get it  
What can replace my fanbase of Halfdans and street rats  
Who bang Danish rap for the detail both verbally and in writing  
But I don’t know if I’m good at it; it’s pure instinct I lay my route with  
Not talking about a fucking Facebook post, my ten fingers are chronic  
For now, it’s only when my impulses get put down on paper that both my hands are calm – I feel bound to the paper like a mummy  
I’ve built myself a set of qualities, but it’s hard to find meaning in it  
As we sink deeper into the tracks nature has laid for us, what happened to the road where we chose what we wanted?  
Where the brain didn’t disappear in the alcohol  
Where the glances had a prickling fire behind the pupil  
Where nothing could hold us back like Shaquille O’Neal  
The world is small, but when it calls, the Danes stay quiet  
What about the fates we chose to sacrifice? What about the speaking time we chose to waste?  
Now it seems we allow each other to have fallen into the groove  
We’re so good at participating, but we put more weight on taking than sharing  
We’ve forgotten what we’re doing here, like Alfonso Trendy from Casper & Mandrillen  
Fuck it, they’re all in a rush to take a piss break  
Fuck your name, it’s what you can contribute, a sea of opportunities, free play  
Dare to be in deep water or do you go to the nail? No one goes to the beach anymore to find trash, just let your lyrics crash, set demands  
It can backfire but also add color to the monochrome industry  
Heraus! How could the music industry end up in the arms of filthy crawlers  
And money man inbreeding, sending scouts to find dirt but  
I’d rather take it with me to my grave and spit fire to a crowd that goes “wow”  
Rhyme-ragnarok in my head, it gives a bit of claustrophobia like being locked in a pen like the Falcon from Bilbao. Ni hao! My brain has gone “CLICK CLICK BLOW”  
Now there are sentences inviting their friends over and addressing you right now Do you think I’m completely out? It hurts a bit behind my chalkboard  
Fix your rubber arm, aim for the moon and hit  
No one knows if it was the right moment we managed to catch  
Let’s miss something together  
December 2015  
Red noses turn into red hats again, is Pyrus the hero?  
Standing involuntarily as the scary image they give  
The one with the red hair on TV is getting infected by Pia  
Now they won’t open up because of the Danish values of freedom  
Translated: We shit while the water in the toilet rises  
And they’ve even commented  
Stupidly on
