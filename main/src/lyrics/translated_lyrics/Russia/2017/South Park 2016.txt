**Translated Lyrics:**

We set the house on fire here  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings (ba, ba, ba, ra, ba, ba)  
South Park kicks ass  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings  
Damn it all to hell!

[Chorus]  
We set the house on fire here  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings (ba, ba, ba, ra, ba, ba)  
South Park kicks ass  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings  
Damn it all to hell!

[Verse 1]  
Now I've messed up again  
Spent a ton of cash  
On girls and beer  
The Mastercard's maxed out  
My wallet's aching  
And the room spins like never before, wasted!  
Something has gone terribly wrong  
Everyone over forty is shocked (oh no!)  
But I've been told  
That life is a party and you're not invited!

[Chorus]  
We set the house on fire here  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings (ba, ba, ba, ra, ba, ba)  
South Park kicks ass  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings  
Damn it all to hell!  
There's only one thing to do in South Park, get the girls!  
Damn it all to hell!

[Chorus]  
We set the house on fire here  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings (ba, ba, ba, ra, ba, ba)  
South Park kicks ass  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings  
Damn it all to hell!

[Chorus]  
We set the house on fire here  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings (ba, ba, ba, ra, ba, ba)  
South Park kicks ass  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings  
Damn it all to hell!

[Chorus]  
We set the house on fire here  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings (ba, ba, ba, ra, ba, ba)  
South Park kicks ass  
And everyone raises their glasses and sings  
Damn it all to hell!

[Outro]  
I won 100 million on scratch cards  
Now I'm rich again!
