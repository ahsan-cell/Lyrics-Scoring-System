**Translated Lyrics:**

You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
No, you can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  

[Verse 1]  
I live each day as if it were my last  
Everything goes too fast, I have no time to waste  
So baby, what would you do if we only had tonight?  

[Chorus]  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
No, you can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  

[Verse 2]  
I want to see you naked, you can come onto my sheets  
I want to see you naked, tonight, tonight  
I want to see you naked, hey naked, hey naked, hey  
Shake a little on that booty, hey booty, hey booty, hey  
I want to see you naked, hey naked, hey naked, hey  
Shake a little on that booty, tonight  
"Ah, I love when you use your hand to massage my neck"  
"It's not the hand, baby, it's the dick"  
You know my dick is big and it gets hard when you're near  
When you see my rolling bus, it stinks of cows  

[Chorus]  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
No, you can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  

[Verse 3]  
I want to see you naked, you can come onto my sheets  
I want to see you naked, tonight, tonight  
I want to see you naked, hey naked, hey naked, hey  
Shake a little on that booty, hey booty, hey booty, hey  
I want to see you naked, hey naked, hey naked, hey  
Shake a little on that booty, tonight  

[Chorus]  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
No, you can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  

[Chorus]  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
No, you can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us  
You can't roll with us
