**Translated Lyrics:**

Who pours the glasses all the way to the top? Monstars!  
Who feels the vibe in their body? Monstars!  
Woah-ah, the crazy ones are doing fine  
And I'm going out to drink, so baby, I must go  

[Verse 1]  
Who do you know that bumps like no other?  
It's Monstars, of course, it's Monstars  
The ladies keep coming in and don’t want to leave  
Because it’s Monstars, doing it for Monstars  
We don’t want to do like the others  
We don’t want to listen, we’re doing our own thing now  
You decide, yeah, it can be the same  
I don’t want to listen, everyone’s roaring now (Roaring now)  

[Chorus]  
Who pours the glasses all the way to the top? Monstars!  
Who feels the vibe in their body? Monstars!  
Woah-ah, the crazy ones are doing fine  
And I'm going out to drink, so baby, I must go  
Monstars  

[Verse 2]  
I’m not tired but [?] how about you?  
I guess not, it’s too late to turn back anyway  
Where’s my drink, I have more left  
But I can’t remember where I hid it  
We don’t want to do like the others  
We don’t want to listen, we’re doing our own thing now  
You decide, yeah, it can be the same  
I don’t want to listen, everyone’s roaring now (Roaring now)  

[Chorus]  
Who pours the glasses all the way to the top? Monstars!  
Who feels the vibe in their body? Monstars!  
Woah-ah, the crazy ones are doing fine  
And I'm going out to drink, so baby, I must go  

[Chorus]  
Who pours the glasses all the way to the top? Monstars!  
Who feels the vibe in their body? Monstars!  
Woah-ah, the crazy ones are doing fine  
And I'm going out to drink, so baby, I must go
