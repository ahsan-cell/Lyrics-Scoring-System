**Translated Lyrics:**

(Oh baby, come and take me one more time)  
Hahaha, I remember nothing from yesterday  
That's so typical of me, Dory  

I don’t recall the pre-party or the taxi home  
I keep falling for the same trap again and again  
You seem familiar, I'm a bit in doubt  
You said, "Baby, I can be whoever you want"  
Woke up with my pants full of sand  
(Aoh aoh)  
I’ve been fishing and hooked a little bit  
(On a beach)  
I always run out of cash, sorry Dory for asking  
Hey, tell me, have I met you before?  

She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(I can be whoever you want)  
Oh baby, come and take me  
Baby, come and take me  
Baby, come and take me  

She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me, baby, come and take me)  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me)  

I don’t remember you  
Sorry Dory  
But you have stains on your clothes (Hehe)  
And scrapes on your knees (Oops)  
So it really looks like we’ve met quite recently (Hahaha)  

I don’t recall the pre-party or the taxi home  
I keep falling for the same trap again and again  
You seem familiar, I'm a bit in doubt  
You said, "Baby, I can be whoever you want"  

I think I hooked up with someone in a tanning salon  
Drank too much, threw up in an aquarium  
Went to Nash and tried to buy up all of Burger King  
Now I’m broke and remember nothing  

She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(I can be whoever you want)  
Oh baby, come and take me  
Baby, come and take me  
Baby, come and take me  

She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me, baby, come and take me)  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me)  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
Oh baby, come and take me, baby, come and take me  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me)  
Oh baby, come and take me  
Baby, come and take me  
Baby, come and take me  

She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be who you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
I can be whoever you want  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me, baby, come and take me)  
She said: Oh baby, come and take me one more time  
(Oh baby, come and take me)
