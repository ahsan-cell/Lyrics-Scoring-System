**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Slobadonka, you got kicked out  
But am I cleaning the floor this week?  
No, no, no, I’ll clean the floor myself (what?)  
With champagne (oh no!)  
Versace  

[Verse 1]  
There are so many suitors in this town  
I say no, no, no  
So many suitors on their knees  
They want me, me, me, me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I have hundreds of messages on my phone  
Haven't dressed up, but look like a million  
You looked at me and thought he must be rich  
I looked at you and thought I’ll give you (a little something)  

[Chorus]  
Everyone's throwing money in the air  
Everyone's pumping it up  
Let it flow on that hot 98's backside (hey, hey, hey)  
Throwing money in the air  
Everyone's pumping it up  
Let it flow on that hot 98's backside  
Hey, hey, hey (hey, hey)  
I see that you’re keen on me, me, me (me, me)  
So baby, maybe you and I, I, I should hey, hey, hey, okay  
Versace, let’s go!  
Hey, hey, hey (hey, hey)  
I see that you’re keen on me, me, me (me, me)  
So baby, maybe you and I, I, I should hey, hey, hey, okay  

[Chorus]  
Everyone's throwing money in the air  
Everyone's pumping it up  
Let it flow on that hot 98's backside  
Throwing money in the air  
Everyone's pumping it up  
Let it flow on that hot 98's backside  
Everyone's throwing money in the air  
Everyone's pumping it up  
Let it flow on that hot 98's backside  
Throwing money in the air  
Everyone's pumping it up  
Let it flow on that hot 98's backside  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I have hundreds of messages on my phone  
Haven't dressed up, but look like a million
