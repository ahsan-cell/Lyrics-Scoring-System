**Translated Lyrics:**

I have something no one else has  
Timeless girls driving Jaguars  
I feel so free  
The wait is finally over  
Taking you to the wings  
Announcing the party  
I have something no one else has  
Crazy motherfuckers here drinking up a bar  
But I haven't drunk enough  
Even though I'm feeling great  
I'll probably end up with Shock tonight  

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, I'm gonna take you to a fucked-up fantasy  
Let me see how shocked you can be  
I should take a timeout  
But I can't get enough  
And the whole city here is getting Shock  

[Verse 2]  
Blown away everywhere  
If you drive by, you should slow down and swing  
Huge amounts of energy get you ready to fly  
These chicks give you wings  
I have something no one else has  
Crazy motherfuckers here drinking up a bar  
But I haven't drunk enough  
Even though I'm feeling great  
I'll probably end up with Shock tonight  

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, I'm gonna take you to a fucked-up fantasy  
Let me see how shocked you can be  
I should take a timeout  
But I can't get enough  
And the whole city here is getting  

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, I'm gonna take you to a fucked-up fantasy  
Let me see how shocked you can be  
I should take a timeout but I can't get enough  
And the whole city here is getting Shock  

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, I'm gonna take you to a fucked-up fantasy  
Let me see how shocked you can be  
I should take a timeout but I can't get enough  
And the whole city here is getting Shock
