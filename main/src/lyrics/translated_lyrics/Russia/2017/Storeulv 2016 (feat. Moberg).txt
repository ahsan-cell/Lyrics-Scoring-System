**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Now it's time, and we’re turning up the bass  
The guys are getting into it, they’re kings of the place  
'Cause I’m gonna hook up under the moonlight  
Lay down for the big bad wolf  
Join in for a hell of a fuss  
The guys are serving shots and a wild party  
A Jägermeister lurking around  
Catching big ladies on the prowl  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You said you’d never met someone like me before  
Under a full moon, I said don’t touch  

**[Chorus]**  
'Cause all I wanted was to roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink more  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Everyone here is in now, and we’re singing in chorus  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink more  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Everyone here is in now, you gotta move aside  

**[Bridge]**  
Are you on a van? (No)  
Are you on a bus? (Yes)  
Van (No)  
Bus (Yes)  
You gotta move aside  
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta move aside  

**[Verse 2]**  
Who’s hiding in the woods over there?  
A little red riding hood in her graduation clothes  
'Cause I’m gonna hook up under the moonlight  
Lay down for the big bad wolf  
Join in for a hell of a fuss  
The guys are serving shots and a wild party  
A Jägermeister lurking around  
Catching big ladies on the prowl  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You said you’d never met someone like me before  
Under a full moon, I said don’t touch  

**[Chorus]**  
'Cause all I wanted was to roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink more  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Everyone here is in now, and we’re singing in chorus  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink more  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Everyone here is in now, you gotta move aside  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink more  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Everyone here is in now  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink, drink more  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll more  
Everyone here is in now, you gotta move aside
