**[Intro]**  
Yeah, yeah  
Miyagi  

**[Chorus]**  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  

**[Verse 1]**  
In a world of damn antennas,  
In times of change, urban days grow dim.  
I wasn’t ready to quell this love, turned gray,  
I hate myself, but I live each day.  
Only clouds and shadows,  
From the tall tales, he didn’t want to know me.  
This world has burned out for me, kill me,  
Bury my body, I’m not waiting for change.  
I’m bored with it all,  
In particular, I promised myself,  
Not to forget for whom I live, but I’m scum,  
A jerk, a bastard — I couldn’t hold back.  
I twisted the day,  
Music, you fool, hit me in crowds.  
But what’s the point? I won’t die from this.  
Forget my name. Forget me.  

**[Chorus]**  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  

**[Verse 2]**  
They say it’s like running on rails,  
Tesla flipped the world, we’re causing a ruckus.  
You sing, as if God would sing,  
These are the shores of the masters, the east.  
And here’s the deal: it’s either you or stop.  
Douse me with water when there’s a burn.  
Kind but cruel — it protects.  
They cursed the bullets, the beat and fight resolved.  
I’m an unfinished portrait on the wall,  
Either a mannequin or a man.  
Don’t believe this, don’t believe that, don’t believe this,  
Don’t believe this, never believe it.  
In return, I threw down lines,  
It’s a matter of change. I’ve seen dreams anew,  
And drowned this love, and navigated again.  
“They’re just empty sounds!” — they said spitefully.  

**[Chorus]**  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.  
We’ve lost ourselves, no need for mana,  
A team of wizards — all in, and zombies.  
There’s a playful beat, wandering through the bars,  
For bravado here, the fallen captain drowned.  
With unfinished acapellas, I sprinkled some sorrow,  
Catch it for life, it’s not a fountain.
