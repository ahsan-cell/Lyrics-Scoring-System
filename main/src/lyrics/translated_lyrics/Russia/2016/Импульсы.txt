**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I let the sound in through the membranes,  
And from within, the heartbeat plays.  
We’re high up in colorful hues,  
On what frequency will the sky take us away?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The night won’t let go, the night won’t let go,  
The night won’t release us, it’s merciless.  
The night won’t let go, the night won’t let go,  
The night won’t release us, it’s merciless.  

[Chorus]  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
It’s too risky to trust them.  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
We can’t escape from them.  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
It’s too risky to trust them.  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
We can’t escape from them.  

[Verse 2]  
Thoughts slowly leave their trace,  
In the handwriting of the night, hiding the light.  
Somewhere outside the zone, all the numbers,  
And the hustle seems to freeze.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The night won’t let go, the night won’t let go,  
The night won’t release us, it’s merciless.  
The night won’t let go, the night won’t let go,  
The night won’t release us, it’s merciless.  

[Chorus]  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
It’s too risky to trust them.  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
We can’t escape from them.  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
It’s too risky to trust them.  
The city’s pulses will cover us again,  
We can’t escape from them.
