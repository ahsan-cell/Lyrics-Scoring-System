**[Verse 1]**  
For you, there are no good words or thoughts left, no  
But I... but I... but I turn night into dawn, yet I'm alone again  
I got tangled in the gloss. We’re almost strangers in it  
You wanted to leave and watch how I would cope later  
Running after you barefoot  

**[Chorus]**  
Today, today, today it's you, and tomorrow it's me  
Remember, my sweet -  
All people are just people, but I’m a superstar  
Star! And I’m a superstar! Star!  

**[Verse 2]**  
We’re like different planets. It seems there’s no choice left  
But I da... but I da... but I danced for you, looking so fine  
And your words cut gently. Resisting is almost useless  
Everything on pause, everything for later; for later, for later, for later  
And I o..., and I really wanted to forget everything  
Running after you barefoot  

**[Chorus]**  
Today, today, today it's you, and tomorrow it's me  
Remember, my sweet -  
All people are just people, but I’m a superstar  
Star! And I’m a superstar! Yes, Star!  

**[Bridge]**  
As always, you’re inseparable from your phone bitches  
I’m so bored with you - I’m not like everyone else  
Stop yelling like a bitch! I can achieve everything on my own  
People are just people. Low starts  
Three to one that you’re crying to your friends  
That I’m to blame, it’s all okay  
I call my girlfriends, I show up in the morning  
Yes, I can do anything, I’m a superstar  

**[Chorus]**  
And I’m a superstar!  
And I’m a superstar!  
Star!  
And I’m a superstar!  
And I’m a superstar!  
And I’m a superstar!  
Star!  
Superstar!
