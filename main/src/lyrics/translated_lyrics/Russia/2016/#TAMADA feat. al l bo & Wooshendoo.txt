**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Miyagi]  
Come on in, while it’s burning  
Come on in, while it’s burning  
Come on in, while it’s burning  
Come on in, while it’s burning  

[Verse 1: Miyagi]  
You burst onto the dance floor, your body beckoning me  
I’m downing tequila, tonight I’m the host  
We’re clinking our glasses, we’re high on joy again  
But still, I want more of you, baby baller  
Alcohol, party — it’s a blast, yeah  
My vibe, wishes like a forest, swarm  
I’ll whisper the password: I belong at this soul celebration  
So pour me a drink  
The dance floor is packed, and between us, it feels electric  
While we’re at the bar with the guys pouring for anyone who’s game  
Come on in, while it’s burning, if you’re up for it  
Raise your hands, ladies, everyone here  
The sun has set, and the shadows have vanished, the cities are asleep  
But in this ocean, we’re partying till dawn  
If I had the strength, I’d come over to ask you:  

[Bridge: Miyagi]  
Will you give me your word, will you give me, will you, will you give?  
Will you give me your word, will you give me, will you, will you give?  
Will you give me your word, will you give me, will you, will you give?  
Will you give me your word, will you give me, will you, will you give?  

[Chorus: Miyagi]  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  

[Verse 2: Endshpil]  
This crowd is asking for a sing-along  
And at the celebration of life, it’s time to light it up  
The dance floor is on fire, smoke is rising  
The girls know who’s got the groove  
Hands up, feet moving  
This vibe — hearts in sync  
And I’m the man, let’s ignite, baby bullet  
Tight skins, boys — pit bulls  
Club, anabolic, bodies shaking  
My business here — a hot party  
Like a gift from the heavens, pump it up  
The DJ’s back, set the rhythm  
From night till morning, under the beat, heads bobbing  
Stop being shy, come here  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Hands up, my Kavabanga  
It’s empty at the entrance, inside is my crew  
Love this style — love the bodies too  
I’m vibing with the girls just as they are  
Blinded by the light, and I’m reggaeton  
Gathering crowds, my Babylon  
Will you give me your word, will you give me, will you, will you give?  

[Pre-Chorus: Miyagi]  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  

[Chorus: Miyagi]  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host  
Give me your word, ‘cause I’m the host, the host-host
