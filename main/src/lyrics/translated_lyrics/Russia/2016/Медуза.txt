**[Chorus]**  
Hey, remember us, we’re outlaws  
I’ve sped up from zero to a million  
My country is one big zone  
Wherever I find myself, I feel at home  
Hey, remember us, we’re outlaws  
I’ve sped up from zero to a million  
My country is one big zone  
Wherever I find myself, I feel at home  

**[Verse]**  
Look away, don’t stare, I can get tense  
I always enter everywhere without knocking, 'cause I’m no snitch  
And your long tongue is an enemy, you need a doctor  
Eyes on your chain, so better hide it  
Packing my bag, 'cause I’ll need to disappear  
I believe in my strength, but I hold back to not break free  
A bullet in my head and my hands flow under the mattress  
Every track I make is a hit, like "Medusa" — Matrang  
Our life resembles something like a shopping mall  
Some burn in it, while others bet on interest  
Our life is a plane of Saratov Airlines  
Too bad we only have one way, and it’s blue  
So let’s drink to our rest, come on, let’s drink  
So we’ll step out together, bitch, so let’s step out  
I’ll show you the full spectrum of asphalt scents  
I’ll feed your liver with the steel of the sleeping districts  

**[Bridge]**  
Hey, we’re clearly stuck here, my friend  
I’m gathering negativity just by looking around  
Still on calls, I hear how they’ll lock me up  
But this is the apocalypse, and I’m the fourth horseman  
And to create a volcano, I give my rib  
A Russian poet is one who carries a pen  
The wealth of the mind deserves to be the only one  
And I see our conversation as pointless to continue  

**[Chorus]**  
Hey, remember us, we’re outlaws  
I’ve sped up from zero to a million  
My country is one big zone  
Wherever I find myself, I feel at home  
Hey, remember us, we’re outlaws  
I’ve sped up from zero to a million  
My country is one big zone  
Wherever I find myself, I feel at home
