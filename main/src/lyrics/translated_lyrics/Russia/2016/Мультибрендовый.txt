**[Intro: Скриптонит]**  
Hey, hey  
Show these idiots (Show these idiots)  
Crush this shit, twist this shit, blow this shit up  
Show these idiots how it's done (How it's done)  
Skrip-Skrip  

**[Chorus: Скриптонит]**  
You’re hanging out with fans, can’t choose just one thing  
Multi-branded, I’m multi-branded  
With the trends, stealing other people’s tricks with the fans  
You’re just whining here, multi-branded  

**[Post-Chorus: Скриптонит]**  
But you can’t buy everything, but you can’t smoke everything  
But you can’t learn everything, but you can’t steal everything  
But you can’t buy everything, but you can’t smoke everything  
But you can’t learn everything, but you can’t steal everything  

**[Verse 1: Скриптонит]**  
A multi-band compressor (What?)  
In my bag, like I’ve won all the tenders (Hey you)  
In your gut, you can carry heroin and the first (Exactly)  
But you’re still in shit without that (Exactly), but you’re still in shit without that (You?)  
Hungry girls are peeping from the streets into these windows (I know them)  
With the beat, I can sell them anything (Absolutely)  
I’m with a face like I’ve seen nothing (I don’t know)  
I’m grinding like I don’t need an audience (No)  
No, I don’t need an audience  
I’m on stage with the boys, like in a criminal world (Like in a criminal world)  
I could be on the First Channel in slippers and a robe (Everyone knows)  
I don’t feel my gums or nostrils  
I rolled the fattest one, and work is a rave  
Multi-branded (Multi-branded)  
Sweat pouring from a third of the city, it’s terrifyingly hot  
I’m not cold in Moscow, no problem  
New Benz, Vans — everything you’re saving for (Skrip)  
Fingers tell them: “What do you want?”  

**[Chorus: Скриптонит]**  
(While) You’re hanging out with fans, can’t choose just one thing  
Multi-branded, I’m multi-branded (Oh, how you’re talking)  
With the trends, stealing other people’s tricks with the fans  
You’re just whining here, multi-branded  

**[Post-Chorus: Скриптонит]**  
But you can’t buy everything, but you can’t smoke everything  
But you can’t learn everything, but you can’t steal everything  
But you can’t buy everything, but you can’t smoke everything  
But you can’t learn everything, but you can’t steal everything  

**[Verse 2: 104]**  
Smoothies with cash spinning in the blender  
Three hundred Fridays in my calendar (Calendar)  
Nearby are MUPs and multi-bed ones (Multi-bed ones)  
The body needs bangers, she needs bangers  
She needs bangers, and I just rendered them  
The guys made noise in the industry (Pr, pr, pr, pr-r-ra)  
Everything I wear is just a name (104)  
You probably thought we were empty (Gather them)  
The status of your jokes is anonymous  
I have weight and experience, but born like yesterday  
I send to hell where rappers walk (Tu-tu-tu-tu-tu)  
They all swallow soot and get sad in the evenings  
Instead of just smashing everything with a cheer  

**[Chorus: Скриптонит]**  
(While you) are hanging out with fans, can’t choose just one thing  
Multi-branded, I’m multi-branded (Oh, how you’re talking)  
With the trends, stealing other people’s tricks with the fans  
You’re just whining here, multi-branded  

**[Post-Chorus: Скриптонит]**  
But you can’t buy everything, but you can’t smoke everything  
But you can’t learn everything, but you can’t steal everything  
But you can’t buy everything, but you can’t smoke everything  
But you can’t learn everything, but you can’t steal everything, steal everything  

**[Verse 3: T-Fest]**  
Down the corridor and to the right! Deals for an envelope  
Where does it start? I don’t know, but concerts on Fridays  
These boys are all killers, they sleep in their dressing rooms  
Third day on autopilot drinking for Skrip, 104  
We have so many opportunities:  
To remove these fools from their coveted positions  
But I threw away all the receipts from yesterday again  
The number of views doesn’t
