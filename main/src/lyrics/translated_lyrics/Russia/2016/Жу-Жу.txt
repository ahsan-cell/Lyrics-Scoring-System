**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Gлюк’oZa]**  
Olya's unhappy with her Mercedes,  
Kolya's not pleased with his extra weight.  
He's also dissatisfied with his Mazda,  
A Mercedes would suit Olya just great.

**[Chorus: Gлюк’oZa]**  
But let me tell you, let me tell you this—  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!

**[Verse 2: Gлюк’oZa]**  
Tolya’s often unhappy with Olya,  
And he’s not satisfied with his pay.  
They’re spinning like squirrels in a wheel,  
In our office, everyone’s dismayed.

**[Chorus: Gлюк’oZa]**  
But let me tell you, let me tell you this—  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!

**[Verse 3: ST]**  
And here I am stuck in traffic, tinted windows,  
Lowering the glass with the push of a button.  
What do I see? A little guy on my left,  
I steer closer for a better connection.  
In her eyes, I read the question: "Wow!"  
Looks like I’m the first in her life with an S-Class.  
I’ll give the crowd a twist of fate,  
But I’ll keep quiet that I’m driving the S-Class.

**[Chorus: Gлюк’oZa]**  
But let me tell you, let me tell you this—  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!

**[Verse 4: Gлюк’oZa]**  
Olya’s husband is also unhappy,  
He’s Tolya’s, Olya’s, Kolya’s boss.  
Olya wants a BMW instead of a Merc,  
Just because she has nothing else to do!

**[Chorus: Gлюк’oZa]**  
But let me tell you, let me tell you this—  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
I drive a Peugeot and I don’t complain.  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz! Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!  
Buzz-buzz-buzz-buzz!
