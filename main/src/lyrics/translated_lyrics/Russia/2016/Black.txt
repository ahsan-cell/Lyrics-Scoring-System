**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  

**[Verse 1]**  
The music dances behind us, this party will cover us  
In a black car, take me all in  
Black tattoos, you and I are sharp  
Sharp tattoos, black cocktails  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Your tattoos keep me restless  
Your sweaty palms, I'm definitely not myself  
My eyes are hungry, I take you standing  
I want to try you on, come to me!  

**[Chorus]**  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  

**[Verse 2]**  
She looks at me so foolishly  
The club's atmosphere sways her  
Music, guide us! Music, charge us!  
Music, completely entangle us!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Your tattoos keep me restless  
Your sweaty palms, I'm definitely not myself  
My eyes are hungry, I take you standing  
I want to try you on, come to me!  

**[Chorus]**  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!  
Black Bacardi, dancing in my bed  
Don't tell me: "Stop!" Take off your dress!
