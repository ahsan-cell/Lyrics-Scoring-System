**[Chorus]**  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  

**[Verse 1]**  
Check, check, 24/7  
Clubs and concert halls are waiting for my news  
Pow, elbow dance! Pow, elbow dance!  
We’re letting our wild sides out tonight  
And if tomorrow is Armageddon  
Tonight will be the hottest night  
We’ll rock it hard, and with us will be  
Someone’s prim and proper daughter gone wild  
Yeah, I’m the crazy motherf***in’ Kot Kotovsky  
And I’ll soon be in your city, so get ready  
By the rider’s rules, we’re partying hard tonight!  
Aren’t you dancing? (No). It’s just because you’re sad  

**[Bridge]**  
Pow, Pow - we’re cutting through the air with our elbows!  
Pow, Pow - tonight anything goes!  
Pow, your hands, consider them my trophy!  
Everyone in the hall right now - dance the "Elbow Dance!"  

**[Chorus]**  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
I don’t see your elbows  

**[Verse 2]**  
Moving our elbows to the beat, music is the best drug!  
Leva the shaman is conjuring, elbows at the start, just do it  
Pow, everyone shake, don’t stop. Pow, everyone shake, don’t stop  
Stop and play it again, elbows at the start!  
It’s time for the cat to go on tour and get things done  
The microphone and your elbows will ignite a fire  
This is my "Hello" and my "Salute" to all the cities  
To all the cities, to all the cities  
Intellectuals, athletes, nervous geeks  
Snapbacks, tattoos, shoes, and Timbs  
Everyone’s mixed in the crowd under screams and rhythms  
A bachelor party in Vegas is nothing - child’s play  

**[Bridge]**  
Pow, Pow - we’re cutting through the air with our elbows!  
Pow, Pow - tonight anything goes!  
Pow, your hands, consider them my trophy!  
Everyone in the hall right now - dance the "Elbow Dance!"  

**[Chorus]**  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Wherever I am, you know - everyone’s dancing with their elbows  
Everyone’s dancing with their elbows, everyone’s dancing with their elbows
