**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Chatty]  
I will wake up with you  
I will wake up with you  

[Chorus: Chatty]  
I will wake up with you  
We already have love  
(I can't live without you)  
I will wake up with you  
We already have love  
(I can't move without you)  

[Verse 1: Chatty]  
Yellow, yellow color  
Of blue, blue discos  
We move in sync  
You’re mine, you’re my person  
Yellow, yellow color  
Of blue, blue discos  
We move in sync  
You’re mine, you’re my person  

[Chorus: Chatty]  
I will wake up with you  
We already have love  
(I can't live without you)  
I will wake up with you  
We already have love  
(I can't move without you)  

[Verse 2: Symptom & Chatty]  
You’re my person, I can read you  
We’ll wake up together in the morning, don’t ask why  
We hide our hands, our hearts racing with blood  
I can't live without you, and that’s why there’s love between us  
(I will wake up with you)  
And we’ve missed this so much  
We run into forgotten alleys  
I’m ready to soar with you, not to fall  
I will wake up with you  
In the green light of street lamps  
We’ll find each other  
To greet the new day  
(I will wake up with you)  

[Chorus: Chatty]  
We already have love  
(I can't live without you)  
I will wake up with you  
We already have love  
(I can't move without you)
