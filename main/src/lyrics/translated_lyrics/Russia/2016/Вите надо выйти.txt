**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Let’s record this song, damn it  
So it never gets played on the radio  
So it’s never called pop  
And doesn’t sound like trash next to it  

[Chorus]  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya! Vitya needs to get out  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya! Vitya needs to get out  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya! Vitya needs to get out  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya! Vitya needs to get out  

[Bridge]  
In Turkey or in Egypt, Vitya needs to get out!  
On Samui or Phi Phi, Vitya needs to get out!  
Vitya is on repeat. Vitya needs to get out!  

[Verse 2]  
Stop this music!  
It won’t let the man rest  
Stop this beat!  
Vitya dances, Vitya doesn’t sleep  

[Chorus]  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya, Vitya needs to get out  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya, Vitya needs to get out  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya, Vitya needs to get out  
Stop it! Stop it!  
Vitya, Vitya needs to get out  

[Outro]  
In Turkey or in Egypt, Vitya needs to get out!  
On Samui or Phi Phi, Vitya needs to get out!  
Vitya is on repeat. Vitya needs to get out!
