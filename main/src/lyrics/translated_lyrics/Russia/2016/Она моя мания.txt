**Translated Lyrics:**

We’ve been poisoned together by toxins,  
Falling from the sky like waterfalls,  
We danced in clusters, lost in the rhythm,  
But really, is it all necessary?  
Is it needed by anyone? I can’t understand.  
Baby, are you here with me, or just a mirage?  
You’re here in the morning, but I don’t recognize you.  
Baby, you’ll tell me: “Bon voyage,”  
So, we’re not on the same path? Then let me go.  
I’m sipping an aperitif in the morning,  
You wanted to tell me something important,  
And I slipped away while you were asleep, ahead of you.  
There’s no composition here, but you’ll clearly see the motive,  
And I’ll disappear soon, just wait a little.  
It’s already happened so many times, and it’s nothing new, stop it.  
But you’re my addiction, like nicotine in my lungs.

**[Chorus]**  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.

**[Verse 2]**  
She pours herself like there’s no tomorrow,  
I know that’s how she gets hotter.  
How many days have we wasted together?  
How many nights have we set ablaze?  
She’s mine, I’m nobody’s at all.  
She’ll ask: “Why did you come then?”  
But you won’t wait for my words,  
It’s simple, just because.  
I’m feeling dizzy, my stats are off the charts,  
When you’re near, or even just grazing by.  
I won’t fly over when you beckon with your finger,  
But the main thing is – smile, baby, that’s essential.  
Girl – summer, girl – battle,  
Girl – heavy metal.  
Baby, paint yourself with the prettiest bouquet,  
Because there are no restrictions,  
No restrictions, nah, no rules, no.  
We won’t tell anyone what we’re up to,  
We’ll burn with fire, we’ll fly off our orbits,  
Just walking together and hitting repeat.  
My head spins with diamonds, you’re naked – a magnet,  
You’re my world, you’re my smoke, you’re my beat.

**[Chorus]**  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.  
She’s my phobia, she’s my mania,  
She’s my little one, she’s an anomaly.
