**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Alina Orlova and 9 Gram]**  
In the bloody dawns, I search for my comet  
And secretly, I wait for you  
The long-awaited thaw will blow the roof off its hinges  
I’m not a boy, not a girl – I’m your gentle beast  
In the bloody dawns, I search for my comet  
And secretly, I wait for you  
The long-awaited thaw will blow the roof off its hinges  
I’m not a boy, not a girl – I’m your gentle beast  

**[Verse 1: 9 Gram]**  
The world around us, life within us  
Reflected in our eyes, dissolving in words  
You are my melody, I am your bass  
Your enchanted image brings light in the dark  
Among shadows in silence, I will sing to the Moon  
Time has stopped, time has come to a halt  
I greedily grasped seconds when you appeared to me  
My heart raced quickly – you instantly realize you’re alive  
There’s not enough oxygen to breathe you in  
Maybe this is my dream, but maybe it’s not with me  
But maybe it’s all a lie, not true, illusions of thought  
Is this just my chase?  
But between us, there are no borders or passwords  
I feel your scent on my palms  

**[Chorus: Alina Orlova and 9 Gram]**  
In the bloody dawns, I search for my comet  
And secretly, I wait for you  
The long-awaited thaw will blow the roof off its hinges  
I’m not a boy, not a girl – I’m your gentle beast...  

**[Verse 2: 9 Gram]**  
I will be the first ray upon your lips  
In this world given only to the two of us  
And if war comes – without hesitation  
I would give my life  
Medicine won’t find the reasons;  
It treats bronchitis and blames nicotine  
But my soul screams when you’re silent  
But I’m not sick, I can’t be fixed  
These cockroaches in my head  
Don’t let me rest, don’t let me sleep  
But they make me feel more alive, twice as much  
And I have nothing to lose  
The whole world seems tangled  
And we won’t even meet for a minute  
I’ll wander until dawn  
And patiently wait for my comet  
Remembering our summer and dreaming of you undressed  
And I don’t need advice; I don’t need it, no  
Just let me touch you  
With my gaze  

**[Chorus: Alina Orlova and 9 Gram]**  
In the bloody dawns, I search for my comet  
And secretly, I wait for you  
The long-awaited thaw will blow the roof off its hinges  
I’m not a boy, not a girl – I’m your gentle beast  
In the bloody dawns, I search for my comet  
And secretly, I wait for you  
The long-awaited thaw will blow the roof off its hinges  
I’m not a boy, not a girl – I’m your gentle beast
