**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Brutto]**  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent  

**[Verse 1: Rigos]**  
She’s pure indecency  
With me one-on-one today in the First Capital*  
She screams louder if it hurts, R. Kelly, sing for us  
We’re losing our minds under the stuff and the drink  
She whispers to me that this time she’ll do it herself  
The bed creaks, she wanted to break it  
Her words turn into body language  
I like that I can be a bit cheeky with her  
Baby’s no shrinking violet, she’s on me like a ride  
She’s stunning, damn, she’s just fine  
Morning sex energizes better than a workout  
Her tears of joy are sweet, her tears of joy are sweet  

**[Verse 2: Brutto]**  
She’s wearing Jimmy Choo shoes  
I don’t want anything else on her  
It’s not that she’s not wearing underwear –  
She’s wearing nothing at all  
She looks unfiltered  
Even the janitor would toss his cigarette aside at the sight of her  
Getting her the moon? Nah  
I’ll get her Saturn’s moon instead  
Under her photo, even a baby writes: “I’d hit that”  
And Abdul from Al-Qaeda secretly likes her  
Because of her, I’ve become a wide-eyed resident of Korea  
She could break up even a gay couple  
When she’s naked, I don’t need anyone else  
The others are naked and silly  
And I’m dressed in suits and jackets  
While she wears only the dim light  

**[Chorus: Brutto]**  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent  

**[Verse 3: Slim]**  
Even though we didn’t know each other since childhood  
I didn’t carry your backpack to the entrance  
The others were there, but they disappeared  
So they were just passing through my life  
There was free space in my closet  
Until you sat in the passenger seat  
I realized right away: friendship is impossible between us  
Even before we had dinner  
The light is dimmed, the ski track like in Kursk*  
Earrings in, no need for a bra  
You come out of the shower, took off the trinkets  
Zalman King would have enough for a couple of reels  
The clock next to you feels like childhood vacations  
You’re like the first tape with a German film  
I press play again and again  
This is das ist fantastisch, not Lova-Lova*  

**[Verse 4: Ves']**  
Girls like her are on sites in the Best Video section  
In the Best Video section for adult viewers  
You’d see many would have sparks in their eyes  
And if I were president, I’d allocate half the budget for her  
I’d call her Hurricane Katrina  
After her, erase everyone who was from my thoughts  
Carefully, like paper from an A3 pack  
And today I’m crumpled and unshaven  
At her sight, the Pope would curse  
Saying, may God forgive me, but she’s hot!  
And when she’s undressed, somewhere  
In impoverished countries, medicine falls from the sky  
And I involuntarily thought that paradise is with her  
The light goes out, but who cares, like in a dream  
And I ask strongly, as strong as Tyson’s punches  
Don’t get dressed, just  

**[Chorus: Slim and Brutto]**  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent  
Dim light of the chandelier  
And the 18+ sign for her bust  
And I’ve forgotten all the others  
Because the bust is omnipotent
