**Translated Lyrics:**

I pass the days at the foot of the night  
If someone suddenly turned down your sound  
Look into my eyes, turn it up  

Turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up, let the sound fill the air  
Turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up and no one’s around (x2)  

I’m going around the bend, this city feels strange  
No one loves, no one waits  
Here they won’t judge or remember  
And I, I, I’m no longer a local  
And I, and I, today I’m on my own  
And I, I, I don’t seek advice  

I’m riding my own wave, on my own wave  
Times are changing, but I’m in no rush  
I pass the days at the foot of the night  
If someone suddenly turned down your sound  
Look into my eyes, turn it up  

Turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up, let the sound fill the air  
Turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up and no one’s around (x2)  

I stay true to myself  
Though sometimes I can be rough  
I’m not afraid to be in silence  
To be unnoticed and unwanted  
And I, I, I’m no longer a local  
And I, and I, today I’m on my own  
And I, I, I don’t seek advice  

I’m riding my own wave, on my own wave  
Times are changing, but I’m in no rush  
I pass the days at the foot of the night  
If someone suddenly turned down your sound  
Look into my eyes, turn it up  

Turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up, and let the pulse fill the air  
Turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up and no one’s around (x2)  

Ay-ay! Turn up yours!  
Turn up your sound!  
Ay-ay! Turn up yours!  
Turn up your sound!  

I tell myself, in my honest words, strength is born  
It won’t help me, people can be unbearable  
I’m heading towards the light, I always know what I need  
I don’t hear those who pull me back around
