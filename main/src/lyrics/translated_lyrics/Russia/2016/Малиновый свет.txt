**[Intro]**  
This is my youth, this is my youth  

**[Verse 1]**  
Your salty lips kiss me once again  
Salty lips—it's all because of me  
Don't ask me to be quieter, I hate that so  
Tonight we'll dance together in sync!  
We're far, far from change  
We're far, far from better days  
It's not because of you, it's not because of you—  
I just lose myself when the sunset comes  

**[Chorus]**  
Raspberry light fell on the windows  
A couple of lovers dances in the dark  
Raspberry light, raspberry light  
Raspberry light searched for us for so long  
Raspberry light fell on the windows  
A couple of lovers dances in the dark  
Raspberry light, raspberry light  
Raspberry light searched for us for so long  
Raspberry light fell on the windows  
A couple of lovers dances in the dark  
Raspberry light, raspberry light  
Raspberry light searched for us for so long  

**[Verse 2]**  
Your warm hands will wake me once more  
Warm hands will choke me again  
Questions, questions, where do I often wander—  
But I really love it when you get jealous of me  
We're high, high up to the clouds  
So high, high, we're ready to go  
Hold on tight as you ignite, hold on tight as you ignite  
For we are soaring together into a better life!  

**[Chorus]**  
Raspberry light fell on the windows  
A couple of lovers dances in the dark  
Raspberry light, raspberry light  
Raspberry light searched for us for so long  
Raspberry light fell on the windows  
A couple of lovers dances in the dark  
Raspberry light, raspberry light  
Raspberry light searched for us for so long  
Raspberry light fell on the windows  
A couple of lovers dances in the dark  
Raspberry light, raspberry light  
Raspberry light searched for us for so long  
Raspberry light
