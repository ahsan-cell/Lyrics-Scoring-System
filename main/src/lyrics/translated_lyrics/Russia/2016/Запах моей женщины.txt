**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
The scent of my woman — I want to stay with her  
With her until the end of my days  

[Verse 1]  
I want to be only with her  
She’s like my snow in the tropics  
She’s just in a top on me  
I want her now, I want her everywhere  
She’s like an airplane  
I’m her only pilot  
Dive into the whirlpool  
The azure shore calls us  

[Bridge]  
It calls us to Sharm, it calls us there  
It calls us to where the sand and water are  
It calls us to Sharm, it calls us there  
It calls us to where the sand and water are  

[Chorus]  
The scent of my woman — I want to stay with her  
With her until the end of my days  
The scent of my woman — I want to stay with her  
With her until the end of my days  

[Verse 2]  
I won’t deceive you, give me your hand  
We’ll walk through the darkness  
We’re with the wind, let them know — this isn’t a trick  
Let everyone know — this is the real deal!  
Your aroma intoxicates me, like a fat blunt  
Only with you am I ready to spend nights till dawn  
In this ship, I’m your captain  
You’re the only one who hasn’t counted my wealth  

[Transition]  
Yes, the stars burn for you forever  
Yes, for you, millions of lights  
Yes, this is the scent of my woman  
Yes, the scent of my woman  
Yes, the stars burn for you forever  
Yes, for you, millions of lights  
Yes, this is the scent of my woman  
Yes, the scent of my woman  
It calls us to Sharm, it calls us there  
It calls us to where the sand and water are  
It calls us to Sharm, it calls us there  
It calls us to where the sand and water are  

[Chorus]  
The scent of my woman — I want to stay with her  
With her until the end of my days  
The scent of my woman — I want to stay with her  
With her until the end of my days
