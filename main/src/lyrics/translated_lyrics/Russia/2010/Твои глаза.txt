**[Verse 1]**  
In your eyes, I see my thoughts  
And the rain sings in broken English  
We’ve probably entered a danger zone  
Too, too, fast, fast  
And without you, my world is now unimaginable  
Fearing no longer makes sense  
You hit the heart like a bullet  
Too, too, fast, fast  

**[Chorus]**  
Your eyes  
So clear, like the sky  
There’s no turning back  
Such a force of attraction  
Your eyes  
Stop this movement  
For you,  
I’ll stop this planet  

**[Verse 2]**  
We’re tangled in cities and numbers  
There’s no one else in the world, just us two  
An awkward silence hangs  
Too, too, close, close  
I don’t know how it happened  
You speak, and I  
Suddenly became dependent on you  
In your captivity, but what’s the point?  
Running is pointless  
Evidently, evidently, evidently  

**[Chorus]**  
Your eyes  
So clear, like the sky  
There’s no turning back  
Such a force of attraction  
Your eyes  
Stop this movement  
For you,  
I’ll stop this planet  

**[Bridge]**  
Your eyes...  
So clear...  
There’s no turning back...  
Such a force of attraction  

**[Chorus]**  
Your eyes  
So clear, like the sky  
There’s no turning back  
Such a force of attraction  
Your eyes  
Stop this movement  
For you,  
I’ll stop this planet  
Your eyes...
