**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
I like it when you walk around the apartment bare,  
And without a doubt, you turn me on.  
I like it when you laugh out loud,  
It doesn’t matter if it’s day or night — I love it.  
I like it when we watch movies together,  
Even if they’re silly and even in dreams.  
I like that you stole the blanket from me,  
And I got a little cold, but to me…

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t care if I get sick,  
I can set up the jars for myself.  
And I don’t need anyone else,  
As long as you walk around naked by my side.  
I’ll never be bored with you,  
I’d even discover a planet in your honor.  
And while it’s just a dream for you,  
I’ll prepare a huge pizza for you.

**[Verse 2]**  
I like kissing you in the back seat,  
And don’t you dare change.  
I like that we can argue for a maximum of five minutes,  
And only two to sulk.  
I like not noticing the distance,  
When it pulls us together so madly, I love it.  
I like being with you in the kitchen and the bathroom,  
And even falling off the couch, but to me…

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t care if I get sick,  
I can set up the jars for myself.  
And I don’t need anyone else,  
As long as you walk around naked by my side.  
I’ll never be bored with you,  
I’d even discover a planet in your honor.  
And while it’s just a dream for you,  
I’ll prepare a huge pizza for you.

**[Bridge]**  
I like staying home with you for a whole day,  
I want you all night, I’ll keep “talking” to you.  
I love this, let it stay with its intensities, yeah-eh.  
Let every new day be filled with impressions, yeah-eh.

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t care if I get sick,  
I can set up the jars for myself.  
And I don’t need anyone else,  
As long as you walk around naked by my side.  
I’ll never be bored with you,  
I’d even discover a planet in your honor.  
And while it’s just a dream for you,  
I’ll prepare a huge pizza for you.
