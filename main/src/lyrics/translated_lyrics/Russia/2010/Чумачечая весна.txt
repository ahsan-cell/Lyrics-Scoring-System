**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Nastya]**  
Spring has come and knocked our heads off, crazy spring  
And we can't sleep  
And I'm going crazy from love  
Crazy spring, crazy  

**[Verse 1: Potap]**  
I walk down the street, feeling a bit insane  
To avoid squinting in the sun, I put on my shades  
And in the reflections, I see candy girls  
Don’t take offense at my boldness, just offer me a cigarette  

**[Chorus: Nastya]**  
Spring has come and knocked our heads off, crazy spring  
And we can't sleep  
And I'm going crazy from love  
Crazy spring, crazy  
Crazy spring has come and blown our minds away  
Crazy spring has come-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  

**[Verse 2: Potap]**  
When I saw you in that little skirt  
Love hit me like a train at Kyiv station  
And it’s so good that I found you in spring  
You’re so beautiful, but know—I’m no fool!  

**[Chorus: Nastya]**  
Spring has come and knocked our heads off, crazy spring  
And we can't sleep  
And I'm going crazy from love  
Crazy spring, crazy  
Crazy spring has come and blown our minds away  
Crazy spring has come-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  

**[Verse 3: Potap]**  
I walk down the street feeling a bit insane  
From spring and love, I've lost my words  
For tonight, we won’t be going home  
How wonderful it is that once again we...  

**[Chorus: Nastya]**  
Spring has come and knocked our heads off, crazy spring  
And we can't sleep  
And I'm going crazy from love  
Crazy spring, crazy  
Crazy spring has come and blown our minds away  
Crazy spring has come-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Crazy spring has come and blown our minds away  
Crazy spring has come-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Crazy spring has come and blown our minds away  
Crazy spring has come-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
