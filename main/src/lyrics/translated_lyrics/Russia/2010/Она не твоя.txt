**Translated Lyrics:**

Showed her the whole world and gifted (Pow)  
And the whole world spoke of you  
What’s the matter? What’s with you, life so splendid?  
Do you think you’ve figured out what she needs?  
Everything that she needs…

[Chorus: Grigory Leps & Stas Piekha]  
But she’s not yours, even though she’s with you  
Sometimes it happens, I guess  
She’s not yours, like a sip of wine  
She drinks you in just like that  
She’s not yours, you’re playing with her  
And she’s with you  
Because, do you know what kind of love a woman hides within?

[Verse 2: Grigory Leps]  
Secret, passionate meetings  
Fights and early tears  
Young blood boiling, a daring body  
It all quickly became tiresome for her  
The pain of your love…

[Chorus: Grigory Leps & Stas Piekha]  
But she’s not yours, even though she’s with you  
Sometimes it happens, I guess  
She’s not yours, like a sip of wine  
She drinks you in just like that  
She’s not yours, you’re playing with her  
And she’s with you  
Because, do you know what kind of love a woman hides within?

[Outro: Grigory Leps & Stas Piekha]  
Do you know what she’s silent about?  
What are her dreams?  
Do you know what she says  
When you’re not around? (Next to someone else)  
Do you know when she’ll leave?  
Where is she going? (Listening to footsteps)  
Do you know, do you have the power  
To hold her back?  
But she’s not yours  
But she’s not yours  
She’s not yours  
You’re playing with her, and she’s with you  
Because, do you know  
What kind of love a woman hides within?
