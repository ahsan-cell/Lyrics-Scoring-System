**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Often we are unyielding. Passion, hello  
Happiness changes colors once a day  
With you — into danger, without you — into shadow  
This beautiful song has its place here  
Between my heart and yours  
Between the barricade and Presnya. Together. Together  
Is this not happiness? But...

[Chorus]  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  

[Verse 2]  
So unyielding to passion, forgive me  
A cold rain has suddenly appeared  
Come under the umbrella, take my hand  
Let’s go back at least until eight  
My city is silent and the notes are still  
And this hour of drowsiness has caught up  
Hello. Hello  
Is this not happiness? But...

[Chorus]  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  

[Verse 3]  
Forgive me. It feels like I'm alone  
We both are quietly sad  
This is your genre, this is your style  
Your weapon against my strength  
My city is silent and the notes are still  
And this hour of drowsiness has caught up  
Hello. Hello...  
Is this not happiness? But...

[Chorus]  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  
My soul flew over puddles, but I wasn't sick from April  
With your deadly weapon, it seems I killed myself  

[Outro]  
It seems, it seems I killed myself  
It seems I killed myself  
It seems I killed myself
