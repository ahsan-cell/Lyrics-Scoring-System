**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Choosing my own...

[Verse 1]  
Run away, take me  
I want to go where you breathe...  
It's a wet winter  
And through the rain, you can't hear me

[Pre-Chorus]  
I deceived the day, I bathed in clouds  
And anyway... (O-o-o-o)  
If you are my shadow, then where do you run off to at night?  
O-o-o-o, so, so...

[Chorus]  
You can endure the strength, you can drink tequila  
You can wait for the morning  
But I will keep choosing my own sun  
Lifting my eyelids  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own miracle!

[Post-Chorus]  
Miracle...  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own miracle!  
Miracle...  
O-o-o-o-o-o, oh-o-o

[Verse 2]  
You took my warmth  
And the air left inside me  
Only crying in silence  
Would be too easy for me!

[Pre-Chorus]  
I won't go back, you know that  
Pride won't let me! O-o-o-o  
It will be as I want, maybe that's news for you!  
O-o-o-o, so, so...

[Chorus]  
You can endure the strength, you can drink tequila  
You can wait for the morning  
But I will keep choosing my own sun  
Lifting my eyelids  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own miracle!

[Post-Chorus]  
Miracle...  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own miracle!  
Miracle...  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own...

[Bridge]  
Ta-ta-na-na, yeah-yeah  
Ta-ta-na-na, yeah-yeah  
Ta-na-na-n, ta-na-na-n (Choosing, choosing)  
Ta-ta-na-na, yeah-yeah  
Na-na  
U-u-u-ue-e-e

[Chorus]  
You can endure the strength, you can drink tequila  
You can wait for the morning  
But I will keep choosing my own sun  
Lifting my eyelids  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own miracle!

[Post-Chorus]  
Miracle...  
Oh-oh-eh, oh-oh-eh  
Yes, I will keep choosing my own miracle!  
Miracle...

[Outro]  
Oh-oh-eh, oh-oh-eh  
Yes, I will keep choosing my...
