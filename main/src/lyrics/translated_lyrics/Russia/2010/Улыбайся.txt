**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I release my bird of happiness to the south  
Now I sing alone, now I fly on my own  
Ah-ah, ooh, ah-ha, e-e  
Ah-ah, ooh, ah-ha, e-e  
I soar into open space, dodging comets' trails  
I'll teach you how to dream, now we’re a flock, just us two  
Ah-ah, ooh, ah-ha, e-e  

[Chorus]  
Just keep smiling, keep smiling  
Believe in weightlessness and surrender  
Smile, smile  
Smile  

[Verse 2]  
Casting lines into the distance, we catch our ships  
We paint time in the dust, we are Salvador Dalis  
Ah-ah, ooh, ah-ha, e-e  
Ah-ah, ooh-eh, ooh, ah-ha, e-e  
Above this abyss, blindfold me with rust  
Risking with the wind, breathe, hold it by its wings  
Ah-ah, ooh, ah-ha, e-e (Ah-ha)  

[Chorus]  
Just keep smiling, keep smiling  
Believe in weightlessness and surrender  
Smile, smile  
Smile  
Just keep smiling, keep smiling  
Believe in weightlessness and surrender  
Smile, smile  
Smile  

[Bridge]  
I release my bird of happiness to the south  
Now I sing alone, now I fly on my own  
Flying solo, all by myself, myself, myself  
Myself, myself, myself, myself  

[Chorus]  
Just keep smiling, keep smiling  
Believe in weightlessness and surrender  
Smile, smile  
Smile  
Just keep smiling, keep smiling  
Believe in weightlessness and surrender  
Smile, smile  
Smile  

[Outro]  
Smile, smile  
Smile, smile  
Smile, smile  
Smi— Smile
