**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
On a warm evening, I wander alone  
"You won't be able to get her back," â€”  
The rain whispers gently to me  
I know I'll see you with someone new  
Better if it weren't you  
But beside him, you walk  
I loved you so much, so much  
Thought you were waiting for me  
What have you done?  
I loved you so much, so much  
And now I've lost you  

**[Chorus]**  
And he kisses you  
Says that he loves you  
And at night he holds you tight  
Presses you to his heart  
While I suffer from the pain  
With my love  
Photos in the album  
Will remind me of you  
And he kisses you  
Says that he loves you  
And at night he holds you tight  
Presses you to his heart  
While I suffer from the pain  
With my love  
Photos in the album  
Will remind me of you, of you  

**[Verse 2]**  
On a warm evening, thunder rumbles  
I see you two together again  
You smile  
I turn my eyes away  
What are you doing to me?  
Why do you torment me?  
I loved you so much, so much  
Thought you were waiting for me  
What have you done?  
I loved you so much, so much  
And now I've lost you  

**[Chorus]**  
And he kisses you  
Says that he loves you  
And at night he holds you tight  
Presses you to his heart  
While I suffer from the pain  
With my love  
Photos in the album  
Will remind me of you  
And he kisses you  
Says that he loves you  
And at night he holds you tight  
Presses you to his heart  
While I suffer from the pain  
With my love  
Photos in the album  
Will remind me of you, of you  

**[Chorus]**  
And he kisses you  
Says that he loves you  
And at night he holds you tight  
Presses you to his heart  
While I suffer from the pain  
With my love  
Photos in the album  
Will remind me of you  
And he kisses you  
Says that he loves you  
And at night he holds you tight  
Presses you to his heart  
While I suffer from the pain  
With my love  
Photos in the album  
Will remind me of you, of you
