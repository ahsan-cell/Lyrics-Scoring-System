**[Verse 1]**  
The day was cold, yet I was in love  
There were three of us, too bad it wasn't just two  
He looked handsome against my backdrop  
And I, strong in spirit, just endured what you did  

**[Chorus]**  
You never saw how much I love you  
Or maybe something's wrong with me  
You were simply in love with your own affairs  
This is what love means  
How I love you, you didn't notice  
This is what love means  
This is what love means (Love)  

**[Verse 2]**  
Goosebumps on my skin, but not from me  
Though I was there too, but went unnoticed  
All my flowers flew away with curses  
It was Monday, and I didn't forget about you  

**[Chorus]**  
You never saw how much I love you  
Or maybe something's wrong with me  
Yeah, you were simply in love with your own affairs  
This is what love means  
How I love you, you didn't notice, ah  
This is what (Woo)  
This is what love means (Love)  
Love, yeah  

**[Bridge]**  
Ivan  
A-a-a-a  
U-u-u-u  
Ivan  
A-a-a-a  
U-u-u-u  

**[Chorus]**  
You still didn't see how much I love you  
Or maybe something's wrong with me  
You were simply in love with your own affairs, yeah  
This is what love means  
How I love you, you didn't notice  
This is what love means  
This is what (Love) means love (Love)  
(Love, love, love)
