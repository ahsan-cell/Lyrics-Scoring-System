**[Intro]**  
He and she, silence for half a year  
His voice on the radio, but he’s on his own wave  
She’s still waiting for a taxi  
Lights of Moscow, Manhattan - forgive me...

**[Verse 1]**  
Coffee on the table, azure outside  
Glamour calls from glossy pages, so enticing  
At night he’ll come and say “my love”  
And in their little flat on Lesnaya, it’s cozy and warm  
Everything seems fine, but...

**[Chorus]**  
She would love to live in Manhattan  
And share secrets with Demi Moore  
But he’s just a DJ on the radio  
And he’s not a poor guy, by the way, but  
She would love to live in Manhattan  
And share secrets with Demi Moore  
But he’s just a DJ on the radio  
It’s probably better if he doesn’t know her  
At all...

**[Verse 2]**  
Year after year, winter after winter  
She’s still waiting: when, oh when?  
Her friends say she could manage on her own  
And maybe, truthfully, long ago  
It could have been like in the movies, but  
Probably now without him

**[Chorus]**  
She would love to live in Manhattan  
And share secrets with Demi Moore  
But he’s just a DJ on the radio  
And he’s not a poor guy, by the way, but  
She would love to live in Manhattan  
And share secrets with Demi Moore  
But he’s just a DJ on the radio  
It’s probably better if he doesn’t know her  
At all...

**[Verse 3]**  
Big city, lights  
Days go by  
And still she hasn’t been able to leave  
Still here, still with him, still waiting  
In the photo, Manhattan - but outside, Moscow  
Time goes on, writing poems among stars and the moon  
Writing about him, about how she couldn’t leave  
But she has a couple of reasons to see colorful dreams  
She stayed - Manhattan, forgive me  
And everything seems fine, but...

**[Chorus]**  
She would love to live in Manhattan  
And share secrets with Demi Moore  
But he’s just a DJ on the radio  
And he’s not a poor guy, by the way, but  
She would love to live in Manhattan  
And share secrets with Demi Moore  
But he’s just a DJ on the radio  
It’s probably better if he doesn’t know her  
At all...
