**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: EGOR KRID]  
I remember how you dreamed of Paris and Cartier watches  
And I spent everything, living life at the bottom  
I remember rushing to meet you at night on the subway  
It was a long time ago, all of this feels so distant now  

[Verse 1: TIMATI]  
Do you remember, you didn’t believe in me  
But you called me at night, asking for my company  
Do you remember, I read you my rap  
You laughed in response and played a song by Vladi  
Jealousy, you had a Mercedes  
While I took the subway, saving up my cash  
You remember, I bought you Cartier  
But I didn’t even hear a thank you  
I remember how I crashed your car  
Right in front of the one who gifted it to you  
Yeah, I remember how they slammed me to the pavement  
But I didn’t care, I was thinking of you  

[Pre-Chorus: TIMATI]  
I remember it all, sex on the kitchen table  
Playing on repeat in my head, baby, you’ll remember me  
Sex on the kitchen table  
Playing on repeat in my head, bitch, you’ll remember me  

[Chorus: EGOR KRID]  
I don’t care what you’ll do next  
Amidst money and lies  
Stay in this world where I’m not around  
And now it doesn’t matter where or with whom I am today  
Everyone knows my name, where are you, where am I…  

[Chorus: EGOR KRID]  
I remember how you wanted an expensive dress from Chanel  
But in that dress, another man took you to a hotel  
I remember how I wanted to forget you, but still remembered everything  
It was a long time ago, all of this feels so distant now  

[Verse 2: TIMATI]  
You won’t even recall how I stopped writing poems  
Circling the city, making calls  
You won’t remember how I drove my friends crazy  
Spending on you while increasing my debts  
You won’t remember, but I remember it all  
How I prayed all night, asking the Almighty for help  
I remember how I begged you to keep the baby  
But you went and had an abortion  
Yeah, I remember how bad it was for me then  
How my whole dream fell apart before my eyes, such chaos  
Yeah, I remember telling you back then  
That you’d never find someone like me again  

[Pre-Chorus: TIMATI]  
I remember it all, sex on the kitchen table  
And playing on repeat in my head, baby, you’ll remember me  
Sex on the kitchen table  
And playing on repeat in my head, bitch, you’ll remember me  

[Chorus: EGOR KRID]  
I don’t care what you’ll do next  
Amidst money and lies  
Stay in this world where I’m not around  
And now it doesn’t matter where or with whom I am today  
Everyone knows my name, where are you, where am I…  

[Bridge: TIMATI & EGOR KRID]  
Hey, hey (Uh-huh), where are you, where am I  
Hey, hey (Yeah), where are you, where am I  
E-e-e-e. Hey, hey, (Like this), where are you, where am I  
(Yeah) O-o-o, hey, hey, (Uh-huh)  
(I know where you are, and you know where I am)  

[Chorus: EGOR KRID & TIMATI]  
I don’t care what you’ll do next  
Amidst money and lies  
Stay in this world where I’m not around  
And now it doesn’t matter where or with whom I am today  
Everyone knows my name (Uh-huh)  
I don’t care what you’ll do next  
Amidst money and lies  
Stay in this world where I’m not around  
And now it doesn’t matter where or with whom I am today  
Everyone knows my name, where are you, where am I…
