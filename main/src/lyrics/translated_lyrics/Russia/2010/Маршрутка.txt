**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I wasn't looking for a moment,  
To be together like we used to,  
I broke a mountain of our dishes,  
Gifts from our wedding day.  
On our first date, he spoke of ballet,  
How the engine works in a Gazelle,  
He said he never throws words to the wind,  
He captured my heart so well.

[Chorus]  
This is no joke, we met in a minibus,  
On route number one, we ride in silence,  
He says, "Good morning," but I don't hear it,  
He squeezed my hand tightly.  
And then, as it happens in the best films,  
In the best films.

[Verse 2]  
I see your gaze growing warmer with the years,  
My heart tightens with every beat,  
And he talked about me to his mother,  
I'd give everything for her.  
I chatted with my cooling coffee,  
Wondering why he hasn't arrived yet?  
He was held up again at work,  
Everything will be alright for us.

[Chorus]  
This is no joke, we met in a minibus,  
On route number one, we ride in silence,  
He says, "Good morning," but I don't hear it,  
He squeezed my hand tightly.  
And then, as it happens in the best films,  
In the best films,  
In the best films,  
In the best films.  
This is no joke, we met in a minibus,  
On route number one, we ride in silence,  
He says, "Good morning," but I don't hear it,  
He squeezed my hand tightly.  
And then, as it happens in the best films,  
In Russian films,  
In the best films,  
In Russian films,  
In Russian films,  
In the best films,  
In Russian films.
