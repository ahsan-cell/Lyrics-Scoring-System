**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
And I keep waiting for you, sitting here waiting for you  
You can't imagine how good it feels for me  
When you kiss me, and also...  
Yes, I’m cliché, yes, I’m just like everyone else  
But you’re not like that, you’re different  
And with you, I’ve allowed myself to believe in love  

[Chorus]  
Stars are shining in the sky when you’re next to me  
I’ll repeat it a hundred times: “You’re not like that! You’re not like that!”  
Catch me every day, and I’ll be the coolest  
People always have something to say, but you’re not like that, you’re not like that  

[Post-Chorus]  
But you’re not like that, but you’re not like that  
But you’re not like that, oh  
But you’re not like that, but you’re not like that  
But you’re not like that, oh  

[Verse 2]  
Your eyes are blue, as blue as the sky  
Just look at me, and also  
Tell me that everything will be alright for us  
I can’t believe this is all happening to me  
If I had known I would meet you  
I would have just closed my eyes with my hands  

[Chorus]  
Stars are shining in the sky when you’re next to me  
I’ll repeat it a hundred times: “You’re not like that! You’re not like that!”  
Catch me every day, and I’ll be the coolest  
People always have something to say, but you’re not like that, you’re not like that  

[Post-Chorus]  
But you’re not like that, but you’re not like that  
But you’re not like that, oh  
But you’re not like that, but you’re not like that  
But you’re not like that, oh  

[Bridge]  
I see right through you, oh-oh  
I believe in you without words forever!  
I see right through you, oh-oh  
I believe in you without words forever!  

[Chorus]  
Stars are shining in the sky when you’re next to me  
I’ll repeat it a hundred times: “You’re not like that! You’re not like that!”  
Catch me every day, and I’ll be the coolest  
People always have something to say, but you’re not like that, you’re not like that  

[Outro]  
But you’re not like that (You’re not like that)  
But you’re not like that (You’re not like that)  
But you’re not like that (You’re not like that)  
But you’re not like that (You’re not like that)  
But you’re not like that (You’re not like that)  
But you’re not like that (You’re not like that)
