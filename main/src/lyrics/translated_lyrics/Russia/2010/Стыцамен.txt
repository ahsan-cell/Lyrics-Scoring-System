**[Intro]**  
Ah

**[Verse 1]**  
This festive beat is a blend of orbits  
Everything plays just right (Ah)  
I’m frying ultra-melanin and dancing alone  
The others are too shy

**[Bridge]**  
Ooh, don’t be shy, mmm  
(Music-music-music)  
Ah

**[Verse 2]**  
Musical vibe, B-flat in my left ear  
Makes me want to dance (Ah)  
Those who hear my soul fill the dance floor  
The others are too shy

**[Bridge]**  
Ooh, don’t be shy, mmm  
(With the music, right?) E

**[Chorus]**  
The favorite music is playing here  
I need some alcohol, and you’re waiting on the dance floor  
The favorite music is playing here  
I need some alcohol, and you’re waiting on the dance floor

**[Refrain]**  
My favorite-favorite-music is playing  
Music of love-my-love-my-love, yeah!  
Ah

**[Verse 3]**  
I’m a special type, hear this rhythm?  
Dance stimulants (Ah)  
For ten out of a hundred, the song's meaning is simple  
Don’t be shy (E)

**[Bridge]**  
Ooh, don’t be shy, mmm  
(With the music, right?)

**[Chorus]**  
The favorite music is playing here  
I need some alcohol, and you’re waiting on the dance floor  
The favorite music is playing here  
I need some alcohol, and you’re waiting on the dance floor

**[Refrain]**  
(The favorite-favorite-music is playing)  
The favorite music is playing here

**[Chorus]**  
The favorite music is playing here  
I need some alcohol, and you’re waiting on the dance floor  
The favorite music is playing here  
I need some alcohol, and you’re waiting on the dance floor

**[Outro]**  
(The favorite-favorite-music is playing)
