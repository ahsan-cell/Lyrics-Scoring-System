**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Loya]**  
Why does she need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?  

**[Verse 1: Eva Miller]**  
In my eyes, the sunset shone  
Outshining everyone with its glow  
With just one look at me  
You lost your mind, you know  
And every morning about love  
You endlessly would speak  
But it’s not serious  
And in my head, a question peaks  

**[Chorus: Loya]**  
Why does she need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?  
Why does she need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?  

**[Verse 2: Loya]**  
You gifted diamonds wrapped in gold  
And showered me with compliments bold  
But it made no sense at all  
Like all your surprises, they fall  
So why did I lie about my feelings then?  
Why all this? Why?  

**[Chorus: Loya]**  
Why does she need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?  
(Why? Why? Why?)  

**[Verse 3: Valery, Eva Miller & Valery & Eva Miller]**  
5sta Family, Eva Miller  
What’s the point of these diamonds, why the gold?  
If my heart is split in two, feeling cold  
Ice in my chest, ice on my neck won’t melt  
On repeat, they ship us, but only feelings felt  
All that’s left is to fall down  
So many faces around  
You’re my fixed idea, my muse  
A maze for us, it’s what we choose  
Unanswered, indifferent too  

**[Verse 4: Vasily, Vasily & Eva Miller & Vasily & Loya]**  
In her eyes, the lights burn bright  
But he doesn’t see love in their light  
Diamonds and flowers, she doesn’t need  
His words just make her head spin, indeed  
And every evening, slow and alone  
She walks back home on her own  

**[Chorus: Loya & Eva Miller]**  
Why does she need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?  
Why does she need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?  

**[Outro: Eva Miller]**  
Why do I need all the silks?  
Colorful clouds  
Why all this? Why?
