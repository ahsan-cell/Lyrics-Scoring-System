**[Intro]**  
Mmm, u-u-u, u-u-u-u-u  
Mmm, u-u-u, u-u-u-u-u  

**[Chorus]**  
A slow dance, to make you cry  
And let them all sound the same  
And let it be cliché and unskilled  
But as I could, I played and sang on my guitar  
Graduation, and you in a lovely dress  
And you're about to turn seventeen  
I just wanted to impress you  
And as I could, I played on my guitar  

**[Verse 1]**  
Our whole school went crazy for the new girl  
She walked into my class, and I knew right away  
Cupid didn’t shoot me with an arrow, but with a bullet  
Our teacher said, "Kids, meet Yulia"  
And there I was, like a shadow trailing Yulia — a lovesick fool  
I’m scared to approach Yulia, what if she doesn’t love me?  
What if Yulia loves someone else, not me?  
In my dreams, Yulia and I share the same last name  
And for six months, it’s fire by day, insomnia by night  
My heart is breaking, but the ice won’t budge  
But one morning, I decided to take the first step  
I bought flowers and waited by the entrance, hoping you'd come  
And you came, a classic drama  
But you didn’t come alone, you were arm in arm with a classmate  
And the heavens crashed down to earth  
And then I wrote, Yulia  

**[Chorus]**  
A slow dance, to make you cry  
And let them all sound the same  
And let it be cliché and unskilled  
But as I could, I played and sang on my guitar  
Graduation, and you in a lovely dress  
And you're about to turn seventeen  
I just wanted to impress you  
And as I could, I played on my guitar  
A slow dance, to make you cry  
And let them all sound the same  
And let it be cliché and unskilled  
But as I could, I played and sang on my guitar  
Graduation, and you in a lovely dress  
And you're about to turn seventeen  
I just wanted to impress you  
And as I could, I played on my guitar  

**[Verse 2]**  
To hell with the schoolwork, mom and dad are stressed  
I’ve lost ten kilograms, feeling sick  
Not eating, not drinking, instead of notes, I write songs  
Songs about my princess  
You’re with someone else, and I’m dying, Yulia  
And we’re sworn enemies  
Yulia, because you’re not with me, but with him  
Yulia, Yulia (Let a bullet decide)  
I rewind the tape twenty years back  
Guitar, bass, drums, the old assembly hall  
Exams piled up, I didn’t pass a single subject  
A hundred rehearsals, and I sing for you like a rock star  
I couldn’t fit all my feelings into this song  
But for life, I memorized these verses by heart  
You never knew that I dedicated these lines to you  
My very first track among them — a hit for all graduations  

**[Bridge]**  
A slow dance, to make you cry  
And let them all sound the same  
And let it be cliché and unskilled  
But as I could, I played and sang on my guitar  
Graduation, and you in a lovely dress  
And you're about to turn seventeen  
I just wanted to impress you, ahem-ahem  

**[Chorus]**  
A slow dance, to make you cry  
And let them all sound the same  
And let it be cliché and unskilled  
But as I could, I played and sang on my guitar  
Graduation, and you in a lovely dress  
And you're about to turn seventeen  
I just wanted to impress you  
And as I could, I played on my guitar  
A slow dance, to make you cry  
And let them all sound the same  
And let it be cliché and unskilled  
But as I could, I played and sang on my guitar  
Graduation, and you in a lovely dress  
And you're about to turn seventeen  
I just wanted to impress you  
And as I could, I played on my guitar
