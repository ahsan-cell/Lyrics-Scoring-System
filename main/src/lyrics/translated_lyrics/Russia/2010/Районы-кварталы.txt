**[Intro]**  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
La-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la, la  
Hey! Hey! Hey!  
La-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la, la  

**[Verse 1]**  
There's nothing left to catch  
I've got all that I need  
It's time to leave right away  
So no one gets too used to me  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Bright yellow glasses  
Two hearts on a keychain  
Cheerful pupils shining  
Your name written on my hand  

**[Chorus]**  
Districts, blocks, residential areas  
I'm leaving, leaving in style  
Districts, blocks, residential areas  
I'm leaving, leaving in style  

**[Verse 2]**  
You'll have everything great  
The clouds will be closer now  
I want it like the first time  
And that's why I'm saying goodbye  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Bright yellow glasses  
Two hearts on a keychain  
Cheerful pupils shining  
I'm stepping out light and free  

**[Chorus]**  
Districts, blocks, residential areas  
I'm leaving, leaving in style  
Districts, blocks, residential areas  
I'm leaving, leaving in style  

**[Instrumental Break]**  

**[Verse 3]**  
That's it, no one is waiting  
And no one is a fool  
Some love, some lie  
And fly high in the clouds  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Bright yellow glasses  
Two hearts on a keychain  
Cheerful pupils shining  
I'm stepping out light and free  

**[Chorus]**  
Districts, blocks, residential areas  
I'm leaving, leaving in style  
Districts, blocks, residential areas  
I'm leaving, leaving in style  
I'm leaving, leaving in style
