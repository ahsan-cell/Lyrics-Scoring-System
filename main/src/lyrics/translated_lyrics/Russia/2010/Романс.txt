**[Chorus]**  
Without you, there's no life - I can't find my way  
No matter how much I press against the wall, I can't get through  
Not a single path for a sinful soul in winter  
Without you, there's no meaning; without you, there's no life  
No matter how much I press against the wall, I can't get through  
Without you, there's no life. I can't find my way  
Not a single path for a sinful soul in winter  
Without you, there's no meaning; without you, there's no life  
There's no life  

**[Verse 1]**  
It seems to me, this is going to last a long time  
I feel like I'm swimming across the Volga  
She's on silk, I'm on needles  
The bridge is shattered. Shards of Skolkovo  
She's so incredible that words aren't enough -  
Now I know how lucky I am, defying the cold  
As if someone has pushed aside the barrier  
And how far I've been swept away!  
Leaves dance in the wind  
Without her, I'm not alive - without her, I'll die  
Sometimes they lie, but I see no one around  
And the closer to the fire, the warmer it gets  
Burn, burn, my star - yes, yes  
Everything happens for a reason, and I can't stop  
We started flipping through pages together - faces, places  
A procession of countries, together into the astral  

**[Chorus]**  
Without you, there's no life - I can't find my way  
No matter how much I press against the wall, I can't get through  
Not a single path for a sinful soul in winter  
Without you, there's no meaning; without you, there's no life  
No matter how much I press against the wall, I can't get through  
Without you, there's no life. I can't find my way  
Not a single path for a sinful soul in winter  
Without you, there's no meaning; without you, there's no life  
There's no life  

**[Verse 2]**  
I'm not always sweet, like in the songs  
About the famous crossing at Presnya  
The main thing is we honestly swim in the abyss  
It would be bland without you; it's more interesting with you  
In you, there's warmth, like in Bob's records  
(I wanna love you)  
We're lucky, we both know it  
It seems to me that this is love until the grave  
- Do you agree?  
- Ah, of course!  
This hand of yours! Here’s my heart, don’t lose it!  
Let’s hold on until January, and then - let’s escape to the seas!  
You and I... "Two peas in a pod!" - that's what they say  
Seems they’re not lying. What a twist!  
I want to be closer to the fire!  
In the lantern's light, the asphalt shines  
I love you - just know that!  
It seems to me, this is going to last a long time  
Burn! Burn, don’t fade away  

**[Chorus]**  
Without you, there's no life - I can't find my way  
No matter how much I press against the wall, I can't get through  
Not a single path for a sinful soul in winter  
Without you, there's no meaning; without you, there's no life  
No matter how much I press against the wall, I can't get through  
Without you, there's no life. I can't find my way  
Not a single path for a sinful soul in winter  
Without you, there's no meaning; without you, there's no life  
There's no life
