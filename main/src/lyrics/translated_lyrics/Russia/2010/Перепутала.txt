**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m tired of loving emptiness, it seems for the first time  
I’ll never die for you, but maybe for others  
And I don’t need words, it’ll be easier this way  
It will burn out on its own, in the sun  
And I can manage without dreams, just sometimes  
If my heart desires it  

**[Chorus: All]**  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
But it turned out to be wrong  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
I’m an exception to the rule  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
But it turned out to be wrong  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
I’m an exception to the rule  

**[Verse 2: Daria & Polina]**  
I asked you to stay, not too beautifully  
I didn’t feel the pulse, leaving I still passed by  
And I don’t need words, I understood everything  
I tucked in our sheets  
And I’ll wake up from dreams, it’s a pity I was asleep  
And it’s a pity that everything is too simple  

**[Chorus: All]**  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
But it turned out to be wrong  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
I’m an exception to the rule  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
But it turned out to be wrong  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
I’m an exception to the rule  

**[Chorus: All]**  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
But it turned out to be wrong  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
I’m an exception to the rule  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
But it turned out to be wrong  
I got it wrong, thought it was love  
I’m an exception to the rule
