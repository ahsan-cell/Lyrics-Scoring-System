**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Nikita Goryuk]  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah  

[Verse 1: Anton Savlepov]  
Every inch, every edge  
Of soul and body  
Choose everything you desire  
Everything you wanted  
Kisses under the moon  
Or in a white dress  
Why aren’t you with me?  

[Chorus: Nikita Goryuk]  
You’re so beautiful, unbearably so  
To be unloved next to you  
Stop this violence  
Just tell me straight, and we’ll close the topic  

[Verse 2: Anton Savlepov]  
I’m like a boy, caught in your vibes  
But I don’t notice the changes — bitterness and resentment  
What happened? I’m not myself, can’t believe it  
You’re playing my role  

[Chorus: Nikita Goryuk]  
You’re so beautiful, unbearably so  
To be unloved next to you  
Stop this violence  
Just tell me straight, and we’ll close the topic  
You’re so beautiful, unbearably so  
To be unloved next to you  
Stop this violence  
Just tell me straight, and we’ll close the topic  

[Bridge: Anton Savlepov]  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  

[Chorus: Nikita Goryuk]  
You’re so beautiful, unbearably so  
To be unloved next to you  
Stop this violence  
Just tell me straight, and we’ll close the topic  
You’re so beautiful, unbearably so  
To be unloved next to you  
Stop this violence  
Just tell me straight, and we’ll close the topic
