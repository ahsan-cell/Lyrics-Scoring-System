**[Verse 1]**  
You don’t like the smoke, to hell with it  
It kills the words, I’m feeling dizzy  
Rumors are already spreading through the yards  
About what’s between us, Chihuahua  
What’s there to talk about, we’ve lost the thread  
To stop being ourselves and sleep at home  
We can’t measure us by sight, but right now  
Why are we hitting the brakes instead of the gas?  
The eternal question of why and how  
I’m slowly losing my mind, you’re not alone  
And these nights in Crimea, who are they for now?  
If I meet him, I’ll pass it on later  
Your squeaky little voice is like an electric shock  
That I’m drunk without wine, that’s your fault  
Now the country will know until dark  
They’ll broadcast everything on FM waves  

**[Chorus]**  
I remember: white wallpaper, black dishes  
Just the two of us in a Khrushchyovka, who are we and where from, where from?  
We draw the curtains, coffee’s cooling, pastries getting cold  
Now explain to us, watchmen  
Why am I so affected by her?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Let’s sit like this until morning  
Don’t leave, wait — but I have to go  
And if there’s only one way ahead  
Then why are we alternating between cold and heat?  
I’m tired of sorting things out  
And turning back, here we go again  
Your touch melted my metal  
You’re element number five, no more, no less  
The game is nearing its end this time  
And you’re still silent, I’m talking  
Fifteen minutes left until morning  
Don’t call, I’ll catch it and bail  
Let’s try to stitch everything up, not dig it up  
Wash away mobile numbers  
But leaving without asking, I have no strength  
Let’s try to gather everything anew  

**[Chorus]**  
White wallpaper, black dishes  
Just the two of us in a Khrushchyovka, who are we and where from, where from?  
We draw the curtains, coffee’s cooling, pastries getting cold  
Now explain to us, watchmen  
Why am I so affected by her?  
I remember white wallpaper, black dishes  
Just the two of us in a Khrushchyovka, who are we and where from, where from?  
We draw the curtains, coffee’s cooling, pastries getting cold  
Now explain to us, watchmen  
Why am I so affected by her?
