**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
When the flights of the first swallows come to an end  
And you, weary, return home  
You’ll see from the window words made of bright light  
I’ll write to you: “Don’t be afraid, I’m with you”

[Pre-Chorus]  
We can only be at a distance and in weightlessness  
If you want to fall — I won’t hold you back, if you want to fly — then fly

[Chorus]  
But I’ve cut the wires a thousand times  
I shouted to myself: “I’m leaving forever”  
It’s unclear how I survived until morning  
Cheers, Vera!  
But I’ll be with you or I’ll be alone  
No escaping further, no getting closer  
Before changing numbers for good  
Cheers, Vera!

[Verse 2]  
You don’t come true, though you visit me in dreams on Friday nights  
You don’t respond to any password  
You’re never wrong, and it seems to me more often  
That you’re a messenger from unknown worlds

[Pre-Chorus]  
We can only be at a distance and in weightlessness  
If you want to fall — I won’t hold you back, if you want to fly — then fly

[Chorus]  
But I’ve cut the wires a thousand times  
I shouted to myself: “I’m leaving forever”  
It’s unclear how I survived until morning  
Cheers, Vera!  
But I’ll be with you or I’ll be alone  
No escaping further, no getting closer  
Before changing numbers for good  
Cheers, Vera!  
But I’ve cut the wires a thousand times  
I shouted to myself: “I’m leaving forever”  
It’s unclear how I survived until morning  
Cheers, Vera!  
But I’ll be with you or I’ll be alone  
No escaping further, no getting closer  
Before changing numbers for good  
Cheers, Vera!
