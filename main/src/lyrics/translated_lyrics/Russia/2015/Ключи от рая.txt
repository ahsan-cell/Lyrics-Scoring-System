**How to Change All This - I No Longer Know**

How to change all this - I no longer know  
With my eyes closed, I hold you tight, though  
And we stand over the abyss, unaware  
Of how we lost the keys to paradise, we share  
How to change all this - I no longer know  
No one else can replace you, this I know  
And we stand over the abyss, not understanding  
How we lost the keys to paradise, so demanding  
Keys to paradise  

**[Verse 1]**  
Well, was it all in vain?  
It’s time for us to part, January's end is plain  
And here I stand in silence, gazing at you -  
We wake up together, but you’re not mine, it’s true  
I should have stood up, slammed my hand on the table;  
Said: "I won’t let go, I’ll take you, if I’m able!"  
Put a ring on your finger, lead you to the altar,  
Say I love you more often, make my heart falter  

**[Chorus]**  
How to change all this - I no longer know  
With my eyes closed, I hold you tight, though  
And we stand over the abyss, unaware  
Of how we lost the keys to paradise, we share  
How to change all this - I no longer know  
No one else can replace you, this I know  
And we stand over the abyss, not understanding  
How we lost the keys to paradise, so demanding  
Keys to paradise  

**[Verse 2]**  
Forgive me, I was always scared to admit:  
That you entered my life, and changed it bit by bit  
You wanted to stay, but I couldn’t trust,  
You left in tears, while I didn’t chase, that’s just  
I should have stood up, run towards you instead,  
Forget the plane, let’s share our lives ahead  
To be only yours, love you until death’s call,  
Grow old together, watching our children stand tall  

**[Chorus]**  
How to change all this - I no longer know  
With my eyes closed, I hold you tight, though  
And we stand over the abyss, unaware  
Of how we lost the keys to paradise, we share  
How to change all this - I no longer know  
No one else can replace you, this I know  
And we stand over the abyss, not understanding  
How we lost the keys to paradise, so demanding;  
But maybe we are destined to find them again  
One more time, to start all over, my friend...  

How to change all this - I no longer know  
With my eyes closed, I hold you tight, though  
And we stand over the abyss, unaware  
Of how we lost the keys to paradise, we share  
How to change all this - I no longer know  
No one else can replace you, this I know  
And we stand over the abyss, not understanding  
How we lost the keys to paradise;  
Keys to paradise, keys to paradise  
Keys to paradise, keys to paradise  
Keys to paradise, keys to paradise  
How we lost the keys to paradise.
