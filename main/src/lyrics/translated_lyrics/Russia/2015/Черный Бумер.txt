**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Seryoga]**  
I grew up on the outskirts of a working-class town (A)  
A kid in a trendy cap, with a worn-out golden tooth (Hop)  
Just an ordinary guy, not a handsome one at all (What?)  
But all the girls smile at me as I walk by (Come on)  
When evening falls and I step out into the yard (A)  
I hop in my car, smile, and start the engine (Hop)  
I turn on the music and the colorful lights (Chop)  
With a full sadness in my eyes, they watch me drive away  

**[Pre-Chorus: Seryoga]**  
'Cause I've got a black BMW, it's always with me  
'Cause I've got a black BMW, fast and wild  
'Cause I've got a black BMW, a lively ride  
Come on, girl, don’t be shy, let’s take a spin together  

**[Chorus: Inna Sudareva & Seryoga]**  
Black BMW, black BMW  
With its brake lights shining (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
If you can, try to catch me (Black BMW)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
Cruising right outside (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
The girls really like it (Black BMW)  

**[Verse 2: Seryoga]**  
Our little neighborhood stands on the city’s edge (A)  
And all around, day and night, glasses clink (Hop)  
The local guys drink bitter, know nothing of fitness (What?)  
All because there are no prospects or business (Come on)  
Oh, my dear street, seven houses, three boards (A)  
There’s nothing to do here, our girls howl from boredom (Hop)  
But I don’t care until twilight falls (Chop)  
I’m cruising through the neighborhood in my black BMW  

**[Pre-Chorus: Seryoga]**  
'Cause I've got a black BMW, it's always with me  
'Cause I've got a black BMW, fast and wild  
'Cause I've got a black BMW, a lively ride  
Come on, girl, don’t be shy, let’s take a spin together  

**[Chorus: Inna Sudareva & Seryoga]**  
Black BMW, black BMW  
With its brake lights shining (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
If you can, try to catch me (Black BMW)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
Cruising right outside (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
The girls really like it (Black BMW)  

**[Bridge: Inna Sudareva & Seryoga]**  
Black BMW, black BMW  
(Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
(Black BMW)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
(Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
(Black BMW)  

**[Verse 3: Seryoga]**  
I grew up on the outskirts of a working-class town (A)  
A kid in a trendy cap, with a worn-out golden tooth (Hop)  
Just an ordinary guy, not a handsome one at all (What?)  
But all the girls smile at me as I walk by (Come on)  
And if any of them asks, “Can I get a ride?” (A)  
I’ll take her for a spin, even if it’s not on my way (Hop)  
'Cause I’m just a simple guy, though I look alright (Chop)  
But I can’t refuse a girl, not a single one  

**[Pre-Chorus: Seryoga]**  
'Cause that’s why I need the BMW, it’s always with me  
'Cause that’s why I need the BMW, fast and wild  
'Cause that’s why I need the BMW, a lively ride  
Come on, girl, don’t be shy, let’s take a spin together  

**[Chorus: Inna Sudareva & Seryoga]**  
Black BMW, black BMW  
With its brake lights shining (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
If you can, try to catch me (Black BMW)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
Cruising right outside (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
The girls really like it (Black BMW)  

**[Outro: Inna Sudareva & Seryoga]**  
Black BMW, black BMW  
With its brake lights shining (Chop, chop)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
If you can, try to catch me (Black BMW)  
Black BMW, black BMW  
Cruising right outside (Chop
