**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Time flies by so unnoticed  
Like butterflies in my stomach  
From sunset to sunrise  
Just to be closer to you  
Every breath I take is for you  
And I soar so high  
Electricity runs through my body, I'm losing my mind  
How lucky I am to have you

[Chorus]  
Because this is more than love between you and me  
I burn again and again, losing control  
It drives us crazy, crashing over us like a wave  
Inside me, there's a fire when you're with me  
Because this is more than love between you and me  
I burn again and again, losing control  
It drives us crazy, crashing over us like a wave  
Inside me, there's a fire when you're with me  
When you're with me  
When you're with me

[Verse 2]  
You and I are like two planets  
Our orbits have crossed  
I'm ready to share my secrets with you  
For a lifetime  
Together we can split the world in half  
If you're near, I feel so warm  
You're essential, you know it too  
How lucky I am to have you

[Chorus]  
Because this is more than love between you and me  
I burn again and again, losing control  
It drives us crazy, crashing over us like a wave  
Inside me, there's a fire when you're with me  
Because this is more than love between you and me  
I burn again and again, losing control  
It drives us crazy, crashing over us like a wave  
Inside me, there's a fire when you're with me  
When you're with me  
When you're with me

[Outro]  
This is more than love between you and me  
I burn again and again, losing control  
It drives us crazy, crashing over us like a wave  
Inside me, there's a fire when you're with me
