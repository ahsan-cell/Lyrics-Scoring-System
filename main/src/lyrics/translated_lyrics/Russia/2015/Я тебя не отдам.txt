**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Olga Seryabkina]  
Our shadows hid beneath the lamp  
So that no one would see this love  
I’ll try to dance in time on my toes  
My heart cries with me, this coat will hide it all  

[Pre-Chorus: Olga Seryabkina & Daria Shashina]  
Take me, I’m yours, about you, for you completely, maybe I’m foolish?  
Take all my warmth lovingly in your hands  

[Chorus: Elena Temnikova & Everyone]  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never  

[Verse 2: Elena Temnikova]  
Do you hear, this warmth isn’t from the sea  
I haven’t forgotten you, but you’re not alone  
My lips don’t argue with you  
Your name is caressed by thousands of icebergs  

[Pre-Chorus: Daria Shashina]  
Embrace me, I’m yours, about you, for you completely, maybe I’m foolish?  
Take all my warmth lovingly with a kiss  

[Chorus: Elena Temnikova & Everyone]  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never  

[Bridge: Elena Temnikova & Everyone]  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never  

[Chorus: Elena Temnikova & Everyone]  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never, to anyone, to anyone  
I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up, I won’t give you up  
Never, never
