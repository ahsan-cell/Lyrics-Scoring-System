**Translated Lyrics:**

From Friday to Monday, I'm with you  
A slacker and broke, but still, I'm yours  
I promise you, this is just temporary  
I want you to be sure of me  

Your parents don’t like me  
They talk nonsense, saying I’ll ruin you  
Everyone says I'm bad, but it’s just temporary  
I want you to be pregnant with my child  

**[Chorus]**  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
And to be honest, I’m so lucky to have you  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
I wonder, is this real or a dream?  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
And to be honest, I’m so lucky to have you  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
I wonder, is this real or a dream?  

**[Verse 2]**  
From Friday to Monday, you’re with me  
Don’t call my feelings a game  
Don’t joke about this, I’m serious  
Go tell your family, let them wipe their tears  
And in a white dress, you wore a veil  
In your eyes, I saw how much you wanted this  
And now my head is spinning  
I want you to...  

**[Interlude]**  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
And to be honest, I’m so lucky to have you  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
I wonder, is this real or a dream?  

**[Chorus]**  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
And to be honest, I’m so lucky to have you  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
I wonder, is this real or a dream?  
Is this real or a dream...  

**[Bridge]**  
Oh-oh-hey  
Oh-oh-hey  
Oh-oh-oh, my fiancée...  
Oh-oh-hey  
Oh-oh-hey  
Oh-oh-oh, you are my fiancée...  

**[Chorus]**  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
And to be honest, I’m so lucky to have you  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
I wonder, is this real or a dream?  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
And to be honest, I’m so lucky to have you  
My fiancée, you are my fiancée  
I wonder, is this real or a dream?
