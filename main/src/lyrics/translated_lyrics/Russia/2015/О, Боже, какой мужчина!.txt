**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You burst into my life unexpectedly  
Changed my reality  
Thoughts flicker, my heart's ablaze  
And love without a pause  
It all started as an innocent flirt  
But now my world is empty without you  
You're magical, from another planet  
And you’re from my dreams  

[Chorus]  
Oh God, what a man, I want a son from you  
And I want a daughter from you, and that's it, and that's it!  
Oh God, what a man, I want a son from you  
And I want a daughter from you, and that's it, and that's it!  

[Verse 2]  
No amount of tender words in the world  
Can describe my love  
And at night, I won’t cry over little things  
You, like time, heal my sorrow  
I know my love is mutual  
A woman is beautiful when she is loved  
You're magical, from another planet  
You’re from my dreams  

[Chorus]  
Oh God, what a man, I want a son from you  
And I want a daughter from you, and that's it, and that's it!  
Oh God, what a man, I want a son from you  
And I want a daughter from you, and that's it, and that's it!  

[Bridge]  
You're Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt in one bottle  
Like the best, you're saved in my phone  
And you're magical, from another planet  
I've found answers to all my questions with you  
Oh God, what a man!  
Oh God, what a man!  

[Chorus]  
Oh God, what a man, I want a son from you  
And I want a daughter from you, and that's it, and that's it!  
Oh God, what a man, I want a son from you  
And I want a daughter from you, and that's it, and that's it!
