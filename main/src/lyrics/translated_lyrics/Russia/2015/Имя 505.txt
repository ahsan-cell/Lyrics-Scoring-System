**[Intro: Nadya Dorofeeva]**  
Ah, maybe we’ll forget everything and run away?  
We have one love and only one life  
Ah, maybe we’ll forget everything and run away?  
Forever  

**[Chorus: Nadya Dorofeeva]**  
I’ll forget my beloved name, yours specifically  
My beloved name, and my invincible love  
My name specifically, your beloved, my beloved  
My beloved name, yours specifically  
My beloved name, and my invincible love  
My name specifically, your beloved, my beloved  

**[Verse: Pozitiv]**  
Again and again, I’ll try to set everything straight  
I’ll try to understand or even accept the quirks  
Five hundred five, five hundred five, I broke up with you a thousand times (once)  
But again and again, I’ll try to carve it into my heart  

**[Chorus: Nadya Dorofeeva]**  
Your name specifically, my beloved, and my invincible love  
My name specifically, your beloved, my beloved name  
My beloved, your name specifically, my beloved  
And my invincible love, my name specifically, your beloved  
My beloved  

**[Bridge: Nadya Dorofeeva]**  
Ah, maybe we’ll forget everything and run away?  
We have one love and only one life  
Ah, maybe we’ll forget everything and run away?  
Forever  

**[Chorus: Nadya Dorofeeva]**  
I’ll forget my beloved name, yours specifically  
My beloved name, and my invincible love  
My name specifically, your beloved, my beloved  
My beloved name, yours specifically  
My beloved name, and my invincible love  
My name specifically, your beloved, my beloved  

**[Outro: Nadya Dorofeeva]**  
Specifically mine, specifically mine, specifically mine, specifically mine, specifically, name  
Specifically mine, specifically mine, specifically mine, specifically mine, specifically, name  
Ho-u-o-a, specifically mine, ho-u-o-a, specifically mine, ho-u-o-a, specifically mine, ho-u-o-a-a-a, name
