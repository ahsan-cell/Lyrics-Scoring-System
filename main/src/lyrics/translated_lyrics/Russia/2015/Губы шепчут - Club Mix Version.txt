**Translated Lyrics:**

Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  

[Drop]  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  

[Verse 1]  
I will paint you with bright colors  
Hiding my pain day by day behind masks  
I know you can't sleep, greeting the morning alone there at the edge of the earth  
We couldn't turn back time, we never managed to drink all the tenderness to the last drop  

[Drop]  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  

[Verse 2]  
I will draw my paradise where only you and I exist  
The cries of flocks of birds will carry dreams away  
I know someone distant, a stranger, is waiting for you there at the edge of the earth  
We just couldn't start from scratch, shout "wait" to each other, we never managed to  

[Pre-Drop]  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I miss you through sleepless nights  
Once again, my lips whisper your name so tenderly  
I dream of you through sleepless nights  

[Drop]  
...  
I dream of you  
I dream of you
