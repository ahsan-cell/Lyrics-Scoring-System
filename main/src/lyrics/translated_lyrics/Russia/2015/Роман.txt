**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Don't be afraid, Roman  
Can you touch this?  
Do you wanna dance with me?  
Yeah!

[Verse 1]  
Stop! Question: "How much willpower does it take for such strength of thought?"  
When making everyone around happy comes down to numbers  
You’ve awakened so many shades in my heart  
You’re only nominally here, while feelings are hidden somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tell me how many bubbles are in the lemonade  
Alright, don’t answer, why do you need to know?  
I bite my lips, searching with my eyes  
And you, my boy, you just don’t know yet that...

[Chorus]  
I’m writing a romance, the man of my life  
I’m going in endless circles  
I’ve decided for myself, I’ll rewrite my thoughts  
And send them to all my friends  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
The man of my life  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
The man of my life

[Verse 2]  
Maybe it doesn’t always work to spare someone’s nerves  
My religion is fire and series on Channel One  
I live by myself, in my family there were cats  
And no one is holding you back, well maybe just a little

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tell me how many bubbles are in the lemonade  
Alright, don’t answer, why do you need to know?  
I bite my lips, searching with my eyes  
And you, my boy, you just don’t know yet that...

[Chorus]  
I’m writing a romance, the man of my life  
I’m going in endless circles  
I’ve decided for myself, I’ll rewrite my thoughts  
And send them to all my friends  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
The man of my life  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
The man of my life

[Bridge]  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
Roma-Roma-Roman

[Chorus]  
The man of my life  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
The man of my life  
I’m writing a romance, Roma-Roma-Roman, Roman  
The man of my life
