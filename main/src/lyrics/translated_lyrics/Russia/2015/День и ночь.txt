**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Every day is a celebration, every day is a festival  
Each of us here, even just a little, is a king  
Holly-Hollywood takes a break,  
When we party, we party hard  
We raise our glasses for the whole country  
We raise them high for the entire club scene  
Whoever's tired is just weak, there's no stopping now  
Hey-hey-hey, come on, light it up, tavern  

[Chorus]  
Day and night — it's between us  
Day and night — you and I are in nirvana  
Day and night — it's between us  
In nirvana, in nirvana  
Day and night — it's between us  
Day and night — you and I are in nirvana  
Day and night — it's between us  
In nirvana, in nirvana  

[Verse 2]  
Youth, freedom — that's all about us  
In one night, we burn out more than a hundred times  
Holly-Hollywood, did you not expect this? Hello!  
The Russians are coming, so hide away  
We raise our voices, we lift the planet in rhythm  
We raise the white-blue-red flag high  
Whoever's tired is just weak, there's no stopping now  
Hey-hey-hey, come on, light it up, tavern  

[Bridge]  
No strength left, I should go home to sleep  
But it’s easier to keep going and going  

[Chorus]  
Day and night — it's between us  
Day and night — you and I are in nirvana  
Day and night — it's between us  
In nirvana, in nirvana  
Day and night — it's between us  
Day and night — you and I are in nirvana  
Day and night — it's between us  
In nirvana, in nirvana
