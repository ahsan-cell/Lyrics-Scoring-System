**Translated Lyrics:**

Can you feel the smooth, the groove, the b-b-b-beats  
Can you feel the smooth, the groove, the b-b-b-beats  
Can you feel the smooth, the groove, the b-b-b-beats  

[Verse 1]  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
Where did you get those legs?  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
Step, step along the path  
Oh my, oh my, boys  
They’ve all broken their gazes  
Oh my, oh my, boys  
It’s dangerous to look at her  

[Chorus]  
Can you feel the smooth, the groove, the b-b-b-beats  

[Verse 2]  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
Where are all your friends?  
Oh my, oh my, girls  
Boys aren’t just toys for you  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
Where are you running off to?  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
I can’t keep up with you  

[Chorus]  
Oh my, oh my, I whisper to you, darling  
Oh my, oh my, but I don’t know your name  
Oh my, oh my, where did you come from?  
Oh my, oh my, mischievous girl  
Oh my, oh my, I whisper to you, darling  
Oh my, oh my, but I don’t know your name  
Oh my, oh my, where did you come from?  
Oh my, oh my, so businesslike  

[Verse 3]  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
Wait just a minute  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
I’m in love for real  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
What are you doing to me?  
Oh my, oh my, girl  
Take me away with you!  

[Chorus]  
Oh my, oh my, I whisper to you, darling  
Oh my, oh my, but I don’t know your name  
Oh my, oh my, where did you come from?  
Oh my, oh my, mischievous girl  
Oh my, oh my, I whisper to you, darling  
Oh my, oh my, but I don’t know your name  
Oh my, oh my, where did you come from?  
Oh my, oh my, so businesslike
