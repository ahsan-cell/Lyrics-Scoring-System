**[Intro]**  
812, bitch

**[Chorus: Chaos 812]**  
She gives her money talk  
But it’s not what I wanted to see from her  
I dug deeper, found the answer to my question  
It’s some kind of bait  
She shakes her head so much  
I, I, yeah-yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

**[Verse 1: Chaos 812]**  
I just want to admire you  
Listening to her voice  
Face ID didn’t work, tell me your password  
Yeah, I did it in a way that now in the bank accounts  
It’s hard to count  
Living life without regrets  

**[Verse 2: FORTUNA 812]**  
She spilled my Japanese juice on her jeans  
You skillfully change your mask without hiding your face  
If all our feelings are threads—then they have no ends  
Bloody hands touch the face  
It’s so amusing to watch you sneak into the photo  
Your legs shine like a simple dawn, glowing till tomorrow  
What matters to me is what I wrote, my words are classic  
Baby, we’re not a couple, like Potap and Nastya  
Not a couple, not a couple (Yeah-yeah)  

**[Bridge]**  
812, bitch  

**[Chorus: Chaos 812]**  
She gives her money talk  
But it’s not what I wanted to see from her  
I dug deeper, found the answer to my question  
It’s some kind of bait  
She shakes her head so much, I, yeah  
She shakes her head so much, I, yeah  

**[Outro]**  
812, bitch
