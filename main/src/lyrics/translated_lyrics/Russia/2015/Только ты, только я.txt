**Translated Lyrics:**

Here it's just you, just me, just us, our sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Just you, me, us, the sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Here it's just you, just me, just us, our sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Just you, me, us, the sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  

**[Verse 1]**  
Here it's just you, just me — everyone else fades away  
You’re my obsession, I see and hear no one but you  
Come closer, can you feel how we’re both losing our minds?  
I don’t need alcohol, just the right password to get in  
And tonight we dance only with each other  
Let’s push the outsiders off the dance floor  
One night, one love, and it’s just the two of us  
And it’s just the two of us  

**[Chorus]**  
Here it's just you, just me, just us, our sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Just you, me, us, the sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  

**[Verse 2]**  
Na-na, our temperature is rising higher  
Cupid's arrow has struck, and we’re breathing unevenly  
We all live to the rhythm of a huge, fast city  
Tonight is slow and the road is ours  
Do you hear that beat — it’s my heart pounding in rhythm  
Inside, a fire burns, and we’ve caught the same beat  
Let’s push the outsiders off the dance floor  
One night, one love, and it’s just the two of us  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Here it's just you, just me  
The music inside me  
Here it's just you, just me  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  

**[Chorus]**  
Here it's just you, just me, just us, our sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Just you, me, us, the sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Here it's just you, just me, just us, our sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been  
Just you, me, us, the sky  
The music inside me takes me where I've never been
