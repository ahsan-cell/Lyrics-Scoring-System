**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: MC Doni]**  
And you are so beautiful, with a beard!  
I fell into your net  

I worked in construction, took the metro  
Without registration - just got lucky  
I dreamed of rising up to spite all my foes  
What can I say? A man should know it all!  

Build a table from IKEA, have cool ideas  
Make some cash, not just sit on someone’s shoulders  
Be with my love, not just collect trophies  
Less partying, more visiting museums  

Once I changed my route  
Goodbye, Ravshan, and goodbye, Dzhamshut  
Hello, Moscow, Black Star, I'm here!  
I have a beard and they want me  

Now every girl wants to be with me  
As if I’m a superhero!  
So unexpectedly, great success  
Let’s continue, Natali, the country will sing with you!  

**[Pre-Chorus: Natali]**  
And you were looking for me, traveled half the world  
Now everything will be good for us  

**[Chorus: Natali, MC Doni]**  
And you are so beautiful, with a beard, I fell into your net!  
I used to see you only on the Internet  
And you are such a man with a beard! I dream of a duet  
Take a ride with me in a convertible  

And you are so beautiful, with a beard, I fell into your net!  
I’ll take you home in the morning at dawn  
And you are such a man with a beard! I dream of a duet  
Be careful, this can lead to children  

**[Verse 2: MC Doni, Natali]**  
This is MC Doni and Natali  
I live well, though I was once in a bind  
I found myself and they found me  
Inshallah or C'est la vie  

I have a plan, it’s quite bold -  
To steal you from the dance floor under the cover of night  
Your light hair, blue eyes;  
Pack your bags, morning flight to Sochi  

Let the whole world wait for us;  
And everything you want, it’s on my tab!  
Black Card, Black Infiniti  
Don’t pay attention to what Timati wrote  
Now every girl wants to be with me  
As if I’m a superhero!  
So unexpectedly, great success  
Let’s continue, Natali, the country will sing with you!  

**[Pre-Chorus: Natali]**  
And you were looking for me, traveled half the world  
Now everything will be good for us  

**[Chorus: Natali, MC Doni]**  
And you are so beautiful, with a beard, I fell into your net!  
I used to see you only on the Internet  
And you are such a man with a beard! I dream of a duet  
Take a ride with me in a convertible  

And you are so beautiful, with a beard, I fell into your net!  
I’ll take you home in the morning at dawn  
And you are such a man with a beard! I dream of a duet  
Be careful, this can lead to children  

**[Outro-Chorus: Natali, MC Doni]**  
And you are so beautiful, with a beard, I fell into your net!  
And you are such a man with a beard! I dream of a duet  
Take a ride with me in a convertible  

And you are so beautiful, with a beard, I fell into your net!  
I’ll take you home in the morning at dawn  
And you are such a man with a beard! I dream of a duet  
Be careful, this can lead to children
