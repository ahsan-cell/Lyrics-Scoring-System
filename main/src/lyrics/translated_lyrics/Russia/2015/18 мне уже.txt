**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Set it again, set it again  
Set it again, set it again  
Set-set-set it again, set it again  
Set it again, my boy selecta  
Set it again, set it again  
Set it again, set it again  
Set-set-set it again, set it again  
Set it again, my boy selecta  

[Chorus]  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  

Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  

[Verse 1]  
You’ve grown up today  
And you skipped your studies  
You gathered all your friends  
But what about me?  
It’s your birthday after all  
I know you won’t forget me  
I’ll come, and you’ll shower me with kisses  
But your kisses aren’t enough for me  
I want you to say  

[Chorus]  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  
(Set it again, my boy selecta)  
(Set it again, my boy selecta)  

[Verse 2]  
You’re already tired of dancing  
This song has played a hundred times  
Your friends are having fun  
They woke everyone up  
Singing songs from "Ruki Vverh!"*  
Everyone left, and we’re left alone  
We confessed everything to each other  
Because you’ve grown up today  
Finally, you told me  

[Chorus]  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  

Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  
(Set it again, my boy selecta)  
(Set it again, my boy selecta)  

[Verse 3]  
I know you won’t forget me  
I’ll come, and you’ll shower me with kisses  
But your kisses aren’t enough for me  
I want you to whisper to me  

[Chorus]  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  
(Set it again, my boy selecta)  

Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already eighteen  
Take me away quickly  
Take me across a hundred seas  
And kiss me everywhere  
I’m already grown up  

[Outro]  
Set it again, set it again  
Set it again, set it again  
Set-set-set it again, set it again  
Set it again, my boy selecta  
Set it again, set it again  
Set it again, set it again  
Set-set-set it again, set it again  
Set it again, my boy selecta  
Set it again, my boy selecta
