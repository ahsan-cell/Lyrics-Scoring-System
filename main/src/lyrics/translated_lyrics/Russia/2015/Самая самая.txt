**[Verse 1]**  
She loved coffee at noon  
And in the mornings, her tasty omelet too  
She loved living without a care  
Her beautiful knees drew me in, I swear  
Working twenty-four hours a day  
Achieving everything on her own way  
But she's sly, like a cunning fox  
Her eyes had me under their locks  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Her lips were a tempting call  
I met her and froze in thrall  
Her hands pulled me in so tight  
Until we meet again, just through our sight  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh God, mama, mama, I'm losing my mind  
Her smile, mama, spins me around, I'm blind  
Oh God, mama, mama, drunk without wine  
Her smile, mama, is one of a kind  
Oh God, mama, mama, I'm losing my mind  
Her smile, mama, spins me around, I'm blind  
Oh God, mama, mama, drunk without wine  
Her smile, mama...  

**[Verse 2]**  
She twirled with me until dawn's light  
While all the neighbors lost their minds in delight  
What comes next, I picture in my head  
Her kisses are a lure, pulling me ahead  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Her lips were a tempting call  
I met her and froze in thrall  
Her hands pulled me in so tight  
Until we meet again, just through our sight  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh God, mama, mama, I'm losing my mind  
Her smile, mama, spins me around, I'm blind  
Oh God, mama, mama, drunk without wine  
Her smile, mama, is one of a kind  
Oh God, mama, mama, I'm losing my mind  
Her smile, mama, spins me around, I'm blind  
Oh God, mama, mama, drunk without wine  
Her smile, mama...  

**[Bridge]**  
Mama, mama  
Oh, mama, mama, mama  
Oh, mama, mama, mama  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh God, mama, mama, I'm losing my mind  
Her smile, mama, spins me around, I'm blind  
Oh God, mama, mama, drunk without wine  
Her smile, mama, is one of a kind  
Oh God, mama, mama, I'm losing my mind  
Her smile, mama, spins me around, I'm blind  
Oh God, mama, mama, drunk without wine  
Her smile, mama...
