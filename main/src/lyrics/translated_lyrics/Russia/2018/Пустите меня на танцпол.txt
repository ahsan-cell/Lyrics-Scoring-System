**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: HammAli & Navai]  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along  

[Verse 1: HammAli]  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
It feels so good here, all faces have disappeared and I'm fading away  
Let me onto the dance floor, just vibing along (Just vibing)  
Close off my exit with your eyes, I’ll stay here till the end  
Stepping in my Nikes, we’ll dance hard to the beat  
The darkness shines, and we’ll turn it up, let’s pump up the music  
We’re not bothered, problems don’t concern us  
We’ve got enough strength to keep moving  
I’m humming all the songs I know in the neon light  
Haven't slept well at night for a long time  
We may be strangers – so what?  
But we’re here to move, to move (To move, to move)  

[Chorus: HammAli & Navai]  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along  

[Verse 2: Navai]  
Spent all my feelings on those who don’t appreciate them (Don’t appreciate them at all)  
You love me, but I have no money  
I don’t want to figure out today what you’re upset about  
Whiskey rules me today, and I just want to move a little  
An ocean of alcohol, and I’m diving into it  
You want a connection with me, but I don’t trust you  
No-no-no – come on, don’t touch me  
I came here to move, shining in the light  

[Chorus: HammAli & Navai]  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
With glasses raised for a meeting, slurred words that don't heal  
Let me onto the dance floor, let me move while I'm drunk  
I'm on my own, feeling good, just vibing along
