**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Sayonara boy  
Sayonara boy, Sayonara boy  
Sayonara boy  

[Chorus]  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful (Yeah-yeah-yeah)  
But there are plenty like you  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful  
(Come here)  

[Verse 1]  
Surrounded by idiots (Me) and LEDs (Ah, ah)  
I drink black water and alcohol (Bubble-bubble)  
I don’t know who you are, but I don’t care  
Because tonight you’re definitely coming with me, definitely coming with me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And I (I, I) am cold, like lemonade  
No one (No one-no one) is to blame for this  
And I (I, I) am cold, like lemonade  
No one (No one-no one) is to blame for this (To blame)  

[Chorus]  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful (Yeah-yeah-yeah)  
But there are plenty like you  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful (Yeah-yeah-yeah)  

[Verse 2]  
Take your stuff and get lost! (Get out)  
My mind is shattered  
Being with you feels so wrong  
You break everything into pieces  
This was all wrong, this was all wrong  
Take your stuff and get lost!  
Want mine? Take it and get the hell out, damn it!  
Stop touching me (Bitch)  
In the glass, I see the real you (Ha-ha):  
Such an amazing desire  
And the rest is just annoying  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Birdie, fly home (Fly-fly)  
Everything will be okay  
I’m no longer yours (Yours)  
I’m no one’s anymore (No one’s)  
Birdie, fly home (Fly home)  
Everything will be okay (Okay, yeah)  
I’m no longer yours (Not yours)  
I’m no one’s anymore (No one’s-no one’s)  

[Chorus]  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful  
But there are plenty like you  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful  
(There are plenty like you)  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful  
But there are plenty like you  
At the bar, blue lights  
We dance to minimal beats  
Yeah-yeah-yeah, you're beautiful  
(There are plenty like you)  

[Outro]  
Sayonara boy (There are plenty like you)  
(There are plenty like you, there are plenty like you)  
Sayonara boy, Sayonara boy  
Sayonara boy!
