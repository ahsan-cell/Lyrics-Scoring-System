**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Miyagi & Endspiel]**  
I got love, I  
I got love, I  
Yeah, oh  

**[Verse 1: Endspiel]**  
You wrapped me up, you wrapped me tight  
You're like my strain — marijuana  
Sky full of diamonds, summer was flying  
You're my baby — daughter of the carnival  
Move it, darling, princess of the ball  
Night of change, thoughts of a Rasta  
While I wasn't tired, the music played on  
Someone was smoking, someone was high  
This fool Durimara, she's ours  
I thought I was flying off to warm lands  
Summer, sea, sand, but I want you more  
Dancing on the floor, hands up to the ceiling  
From where I fell, I won't return  
By a miracle, I escaped and took sadness with me  
This is our life, and it's never enough  
Dancing on the floor, hands up to the ceiling  
Go, everybody, shake your ass, go  
Move, everybody — my favorite show  
Heads were nodding, bachata was flowing  
A raid of fools, we’re rolling in the dough  
Bring us more of that good stuff  
When that day comes, you'll sing for yourself  
For me, for love, for mom, for brother  
Or fate will twist us, oh no  
Oh, man, I'm like oh, man  
In a hot tango, a music lover, I'm ruled by a badman  
Dance! So primitive  
Dance! So impulsive  
Dance! Daughter of the carnival  
Here on the dance floor, you were too little, too little  

**[Chorus: Miyagi]**  
I got love, I feel, I got you on my mind  
I got love, my skill, my la-la, la-la-life  
I got love, I feel, I got you on my mind  
I got love, my skill, my la-la, la-la-life  

**[Verse 2: Miyagi]**  
Jah, Jah, Jah Bless! Let’s cover the windows  
Again, the princess and the despot  
Your passion can't be captured by laurels, we’re wild  
And together we'll break free over the years  
Ooh, ah!  
Ooh, ah!  
Ooh, ah!  
Ooh, ah!  
In a moment, we can fly around the planets, no problem  
The rain drums — sorrow and sadness  
But you illuminated freedom with your light of kindness  
Did you move your hips in the dance?  
Mmm, you’re my rumba, you’re my samba  
You’re my salsa, you’re my tango  
Bring on the smoke, turn up the volume  
In these embraces, let’s fly together  
Let’s fly together, let’s fly together  
Let’s fly together, let’s fly together  
Bring on the smoke, turn up the volume  
In these embraces, let’s fly together  
Let’s fly together, let’s fly together  
Let’s fly together, let’s fly together  
Bring on the smoke, turn up the volume  
In these embraces, let’s fly together  

**[Chorus: Miyagi]**  
I got love, I feel, I got you on my mind  
I got love, my skill, my la-la, la-la-life  
I got love, I feel, I got you on my mind  
I got love, my skill, my la-la, la-la-life  

**[Verse 3: Rem Digga]**  
It’s just a game, maybe, probably  
Even your nakedness  
Whoa, baby, I don’t believe it!  
Fall into my arms, my beauty  
We’re without a guide, that’s how it should be  
Your soul touched mine, dear, like a lambada  
To spin your hips, there’s a beat, no need to hold back  
I burn with you, like smoke in pubs, give me heat!  
I’m ready to give you all a thumbs up  
Who knows how to make noise — make some noise  
Heat until morning, the crowd’s in a frenzy  
But I’m looking at you, see, only you, do you believe, babe? (Babe?)  
And when the club starts to nod off in the morning  
I’ll steal you away, like Azor steals a rose  
I’ll smile in silence and simply say:  
“Come to me, sunshine, let down your braids”  

**[Bridge: Rem Digga & Miyagi]**  
Ooh, ah!  
Let down your braids  
Ooh, ah!  
Let down your braids  
Ooh, ah!  
Come to me, sunshine, let down your braids  
Ooh, ah!  
Let down your braids  

**[Chorus: Miyagi
