**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Endshpil]**  
Here, on a thin line, I piled up the weight of this home, about how  
A ton of underground rap year after year  
Here, with broken evil, modestly shod  
After smoking, he realized it wasn’t fully tasted  
For a long time, he wandered like a wolf here and there  
Rap critics said this sound isn’t a hook  
It’s different, my friend — it’s like a pack of bitches  
Whoever drops it hard will unleash waves of torment  

**[Bridge: Endshpil]**  
I’m ready to drown your fears in these texts  
Let me, let me lay down fat on the beats  
This is my flava, we’re loud on the beat  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits — it’s a hit  

**[Chorus: Endshpil]**  
It’s a hit  
The track hits — it’s a hit  
It’s a hit  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits — it’s a hit  

**[Verse 2: Miyagi]**  
We added some groove, at the dacha it got better  
Flowers of the fields, pour the water, Miyagi stuff — boom — and into the VIP room  
Bullets in the magazine, no censorship, just like no conscience  
Bodies and forms shake in search  
Nothing to stay overnight, we’re adding groove for you  
A pile of money spent, the guys are wasted today  
Veil, veil, veil — smoke wraps around me  
Miyagi lays it down confidently, we pound, pound, pound  

**[Pre-Chorus: Miyagi]**  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  

**[Chorus: Miyagi & Endshpil]**  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Pound, pound, pound  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits — it’s a hit  

**[Outro: Endshpil]**  
It’s a hit  
Here, eyes pop out, the track hits — it’s a hit
