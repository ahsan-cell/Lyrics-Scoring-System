**[Intro]**  
And suddenly all love songs became about you  
Became about you, became about you - instantly  
How can I forget you, if you're everywhere, if you're everywhere  
You've firmly settled in my mind  

**[Verse 1]**  
Pick me up from others, autumn is just an excuse  
To write to you, to remind you of everything  
What can I give you, instead of tearful eyes?  
Not to be the reason for tears  
What can I surprise you with?  
I’m rich, but not like they are  
What can I give you?  
Here’s my heart, take it, try to buy my loyalty  
Staying up till dawn, she doesn’t care about waking up so early  
I have a flight, you have your business, let’s sit for a while, I miss you so much  
I searched for you - love among all, found you, but then lost you myself  
You’re unrecognizable, yet so close, why have you changed so much?  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m searching for you, how can I find you?  
You’ve gotten used to trading feelings for others' money  
And suddenly all love songs became about you  
Became about you, became about you - instantly  
How can I forget you, if you're everywhere, if you're everywhere  
You've firmly settled in my mind  
And suddenly all love songs became about you  
Became about you, became about you - instantly  
How can I forget you, if you're everywhere, if you're everywhere  
You've firmly settled in my mind  

**[Verse 2]**  
It’s too late to say goodbye, it’s too late to love  
But how I loved you - only God knew  
My actions for you - they seem trivial, yeah  
My heart is filled with you, now there’s emptiness  
Everything annoys me, that we’re no longer us  
And we’re not together, not together and you’re everywhere in my mind  
Your image flickers all day  
What’s wrong with me, stay with me  
Because without you it feels like hell  
You like it when they fill your ears  
With clean-hearted guys, hmm, the crunch of money  
And I wander among the streets and old buildings  
Are you looking for adventures? Me? I’m searching for you  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m searching for you, how can I find you?  
You’ve gotten used to trading feelings for others' money  
And suddenly all love songs became about you  
Became about you, became about you - instantly  
How can I forget you, if you're everywhere, if you're everywhere  
You've firmly settled in my mind  
And suddenly all love songs became about you  
Became about you, became about you - instantly  
How can I forget you, if you're everywhere  
If you're everywhere, you've firmly settled in my mind
