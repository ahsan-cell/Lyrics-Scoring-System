**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The word "forever" we glued together from ashes  
All these words under the open sky, ha  
I closed my eyes to past feelings forever  
Sorry, babe, but I’m just tired of it  

[Chorus]  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  

[Bridge]  
Fly away, but don’t forget to say "goodbye"  
Fly away, but don’t forget to say "goodbye"  

[Verse 2]  
Take off, you know this is it  
I could disappear, but I haven’t found myself  
I asked you to stay, but at the very least  
You should open your eyes and do what I ask  

[Chorus]  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  

[Bridge]  
Fly away, but don’t forget to say "goodbye"  
(Don't forget, don't forget, eh, eh, yeah)  
Fly away, but don’t forget to say "goodbye"  
(Don't forget, don't forget, eh, eh, yeah)  

[Refrain]  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  

[Verse 3]  
For the first time, I wanted to leave from the start (Hey)  
For the first time, I told you: "Don’t" (Hey)  
Just take yourself, goodbye, oh, yeah  
I don’t want to see you (Eh)  
I’ll walk you out, but know that I don’t want to be close anymore  
I stole you once, but I’ll give you back, do you hear?  
I can’t give you what you wanted so much, I’m just in the way  
In this sweet world  

[Chorus]  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  
Fly away and don’t remember me  

[Refrain]  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye
