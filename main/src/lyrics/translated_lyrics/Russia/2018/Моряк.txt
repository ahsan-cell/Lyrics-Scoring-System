**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I would—  
I would—  
I would—  
Feduk one love  
I would—  
I would smoke a pipe  

[Chorus]  
I would smoke a pipe if I were a sailor  
My sail is blown by thousands of winds  

[Bridge]  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
Va-va, va-ah  

[Verse]  
A fresh new morning is waiting for us outside  
My voice hasn’t woken yet, I maneuver with my gaze  
I’ll touch you with warm skin, just the two of us here  
We’ll remember how we fell asleep, reliving it anew  
Warm evening (Warm evening)  
Saxophone live  
Wine and cheese (Wine and cheese)  
Back rows in the cinema  
Nothing lasts forever (Nothing)  
But with you, I feel more alive day by day  
On a warm evening (Ha-ha)  
Unforgettable  

[Bridge]  
Unforgettable, unforgettable  
Unforgettable, unforgettable, yeah  
Unforgettable, yeah, unforgettable, yeah  
Unforgettable, yeah  

[Chorus]  
I would smoke a pipe if I were a sailor  
My sail is blown by thousands of winds  

[Bridge]  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
Va-va, va-ah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  

[Chorus]  
I would smoke a pipe if I were a sailor  
My sail is blown by thousands of winds  

[Bridge]  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
[Outro]  
On a warm evening, wine and cheese (Ah)  
On a warm evening (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
