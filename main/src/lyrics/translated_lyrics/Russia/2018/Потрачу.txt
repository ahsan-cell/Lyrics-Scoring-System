**[Verse 1]**  
I would fly away with you, no parachutes in sight  
I’d take all the hands off the clock, not counting the minutes right  
In this little one, there’s so much passion—I've lost my mind  
You tempt me like when you bite my lips, so unrefined  
We pour the finest wine into our glasses, oh so sweet  
You text me: XO, XO, XO! (XO, XO)  
The sweetest dream, the sweetest smoke  
There are many ladies here, but it’s only you I want to hold  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
And I’ll spend my best day on you (Best day)  
I’ll spend my best night on you (Ooh)  
I’ll give it all to undress you (Ha-ha-ha)  
Tonight I just want to get drunk (Yeah)  

**[Chorus]**  
And I’ll spend my best day on you  
And I’ll spend my best night on you  
I’ll give it all, I’ll give it all to undress you  
Tonight I want to drink to your love  
And I’ll spend my best day on you  
And I’ll spend my best night on you  
I’ll give it all, I’ll give it all to undress you  
Tonight I want to drink to your love  

**[Verse 2]**  
Quieter, quieter, you’re getting closer, closer  
I love and I hate, I love and I hate  
With you, I hear no one, see no one  
Our love is rising higher, kisses going lower  
But you’ve turned everything upside down  
I’ve completely forgotten about it all, now my thoughts are just one, yeah  
But you, my strongest alcohol  
I drink you down, wash you down, and we head back home  

**[Chorus]**  
And I’ll spend my best day on you  
And I’ll spend my best night on you  
I’ll give it all, I’ll give it all to undress you  
Tonight I want to drink to your love  
And I’ll spend my best day on you  
And I’ll spend my best night on you  
I’ll give it all, I’ll give it all to undress you  
Tonight I want to drink to your love  
And I’ll spend my best day on you  
And I’ll spend my best night on you  
I’ll give it all, I’ll give it all to undress you  
Tonight I want to drink to your love  
And I’ll spend my best day on you  
And I’ll spend my best night on you  
I’ll give it all, I’ll give it all to undress you  
Tonight I want to drink to your love
