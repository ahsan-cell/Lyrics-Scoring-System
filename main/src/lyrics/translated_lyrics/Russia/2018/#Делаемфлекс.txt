**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
At the party, the princess Nesmeyana  
In a dress the color of marijuana  
She’s got it covered,  
Yeah, she’s got it covered.  
Baby, you’re so unpredictable,  
No one else stands a chance.  
Let’s imagine  
There’s no one else around.  
Far from a girl who’s all about fun,  
She’s more like an iceberg,  
A girl saying “don’t come near.”  
Perfect as can be, just like Nefertiti,  
Wait, we need some tequila,  
DJ, turn it up, let it hit hard.  
Smoothly navigate from the bar with me,  
And smile, it’s so sweet.

[Bridge]  
And even if there’s no room on the dance floor,  
My hands on you — it’s just a reflex.  
And even if there’s no room on the dance floor,  
What are we doing? We’re flexing.

[Chorus]  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.

[Bridge]  
We’re flexing.

[Verse 2]  
Pa-ta-ta-ta-tam, dirty dancing here,  
Right in the center, feel the vibrations.  
See, we’re making it happen?  
I see you like it just as much as I do.  
So come on, drink up, what’s burning?  
Where we are today, don’t tell your mom.  
Dance like it’s the last time, bet with me,  
As if a meteorite is flying into the club.  
The world doesn’t sleep, and neither do we,  
Tequila, sambuca, and Pilsner,  
We’re crossing all boundaries,  
Only a few are taking off,  
And we’d like to find some privacy.  
You’ll say, “This isn’t right,”  
You’ll say, “I have my principles,  
And I’m actually waiting for a prince.”

[Bridge]  
And even if there’s no room on the dance floor,  
My hands on you — it’s just a reflex.  
And even if there’s no room on the dance floor,  
What are we doing? We’re flexing.

[Chorus]  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.  
We’re flexing,  
Baby, come with me for some fun,  
Or not, just smile at last.  
And we’re doing, doing, doing, doing flexing.

[Outro]  
We’re flexing.
