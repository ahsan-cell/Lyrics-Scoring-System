**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Night  
Roofs of private sectors  
Dogs howl from the yards  
Only the Moon and stars smolder, smolder in the dark  
You know what? (Wo-oh)  
I won't be coming home tonight (Wo-oh)  
I've wanted this for so long (Wo-oh)  
Just don't worry about me  

**[Chorus]**  
The kid has grown up  
Wo-oh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Wo-oh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  

**[Verse 2]**  
I'm going (There)  
To where love is waiting for me  
And behind it, empty pain (Wo-oh)  
I'll grieve a little and drown it in the dark  
And let's go  
To where a bunch of guys are  
Where they'll recognize you if you're brave  
Dad, don't worry about me  

**[Chorus]**  
The kid has grown up  
Wo-oh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Wo-oh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la (Eh)  

**[Verse 3]**  
And I don't care  
Where the wind takes me  
From the swamps to the peaks  
Rest assured: I'll survive in any hole  
And for now â€”  
Don't look for the car in the yard  
And my phone's dead for your calls  
Dad, just get used to it  

**[Bridge]**  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
Red light, intersection, and the first cop  
Turn off the headlights, weave through the alleys, sirens wail  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
Noisy flat, ha, wild slam in the hallway  
Trash from the balcony, posters from the walls, "Have you lost your minds?"  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
Red light, intersection, and the first cop  
Turn off the headlights, weave through the alleys, sirens wail  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
Noisy flat, ha, wild slam in the hallway  
Trash from the balcony, posters from the walls, "Have you lost your minds?"  

**[Chorus]**  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Wo-oh, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
The kid has grown up (Yeah)  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
