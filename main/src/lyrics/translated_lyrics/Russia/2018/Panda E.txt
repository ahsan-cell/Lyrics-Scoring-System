**[Verse 1]**  
Tell me how distance has changed us,  
How tears faded away in the darkness we created.  
Everything around seemed to remind us,  
You’re hurt—yes, but I’m still close to you.  
So let them open the road for us to the heavens, to the heavens,  
And let the moon shine fiercely on two lovers.  
I’ll shed my worries, you’ll lift the curtain,  
I’ll break free, you’ll say it boldly.  
I’m skidding, it’s not about the smoke,  
Will you even ask who you’re leaving behind?  
Your job isn’t to boil over, and you’ll sing,  
And in this whole world, you won’t find another like us,  
And in this whole world, you won’t find another like us,  
And in this whole world, you won’t find another like us.

**[Bridge]**  
If reaching you is hard,  
If flying to you is far,  
A little bit of you feels almost impossible,  
And microwaves are beyond touch.  
If reaching you is hard,  
If flying to you is far,  
A little bit of you feels almost impossible,  
And microwaves are beyond touch.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey…

**[Chorus]**  
Truth has conquered me, damn, your truth,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
Look, our Panda is right here,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
Conquered me, damn, your truth,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
Look, our Panda is right here,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
We run together as if from a cheetah.

**[Verse 2]**  
You’ve intoxicated us with ice-cold poison,  
People lie sometimes, I’m pressing the gas, I’m pressing the gas.  
I’m chasing a dream, wolves howl for us,  
I cry to fate, I cry to the gods, I cry to the gods.  
In your eyes, it’ll feel like déjà vu again,  
I loved one, I loved one, I’m sinking down.  
If you become wild—I’ll die,  
In an instant, you’ll rise—I’ll die, you’ll cry—I’ll die.  
Hey, hey, hey, hey…

**[Chorus]**  
Truth has conquered me, damn, your truth,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
Look, our Panda is right here,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
Conquered me, damn, your truth,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
Look, our Panda is right here,  
We run together as if from a cheetah.  
We run together as if from a cheetah.
