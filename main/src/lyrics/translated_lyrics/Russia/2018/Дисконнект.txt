**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kravts & Eldzhey]  
Ha-ha  
Kaboom!  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  

[Verse 1: Eldzhey]  
Psycho eyes, a sticker in hand  
A label on my heart — a dead battery  
The light flickers, night strobe  
We’re no longer here, the beat won't stop  

[Bridge: Eldzhey]  
A big airplane, crashing into bed  
Turn off the autopilot, we won’t sleep tonight  
A big airplane, crashing into bed  
Turn off the autopilot, turn off the autopilot  

[Chorus: Eldzhey]  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Marijuana and alcohol  
Alcohol, marijuana  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
And marijuana  
And marijuana  
A disco, an alcohol party, and marijuana  

[Verse 2: Kravts]  
A chocolate bar, a lighter, a smile  
Jaga-jaga, piña colada, what bottle?  
I’ll give you a shout, follow my Instagram  
I’ve traveled many lands  
I love crazy ladies  
No sugar, no ice  
No effects or filters  
Clear mind, not on transit plates  
No sugar, no ice  
No effects or filters  
Among the dirty parties, we have elite flirtation  

[Chorus: Eldzhey & Kravts]  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Marijuana and alcohol  
Alcohol, marijuana  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana (Disco)  
And marijuana  
And marijuana  
A disco, an alcohol party, and marijuana  

[Pre-Chorus: Eldzhey]  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  

[Chorus: Eldzhey]  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Disconnect, between us oceans  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
Marijuana and alcohol  
Alcohol, marijuana  
A disco of alcohol and marijuana  
And marijuana  
And marijuana  
A disco, an alcohol party, and marijuana
