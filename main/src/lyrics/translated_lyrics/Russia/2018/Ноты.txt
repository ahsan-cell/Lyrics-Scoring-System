**Translated Lyrics:**

Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes  
Janavi  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes  
Notes, notes  
Notes, notes  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’m not into you, if you want, just give me, give me  
A couple of meetings, then after that - bye, bye!  
I didn’t hurt you, baby, so don’t cry  
And I didn’t fill your ears with love all night  
I’m not like all those guys  
Ready to do anything for you  
I don’t bring gifts, or flowers  
Caught your gaze and silently walked away  
I fly high, my photo on a billboard  
Doing it like this, as if it’s so stylish  
But alone for love, I take a kick  
Know your worth, I’ll buy you with a pin code  
Forget the relationship, baby - what are you talking about?  
“Don’t make promises,” they kept telling me everywhere  
So I don’t care, but this girl  
She really caught my attention  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Oh-oh, she drove me crazy and  
Turned everything upside down like a tsunami  
I don’t even know what’s between us  
But you caught my attention; but you caught my attention!  

**[Chorus]**  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, I was captivated  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, I was captivated  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes  

**[Verse 2]**  
My phone is flooded with questions: “Where are you?”  
I’m out of reach, you won’t get an answer  
I don’t want to see you again, leave at dawn  
I want to be alone, I want to be alone. Do you hear?  
Alone in the city, just hanging out at the bar  
And every girl wants to be my partner  
Bitch, love can be cured, what do you know about it?  
I’m not into that...  
And I won’t tell you, no, not flowers  
No gifts here, just not flowers  
I won’t be like them, rushing for a moment  
Just to please you in any way, but...  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Oh-oh, she drove me crazy and  
Turned everything upside down like a tsunami  
I don’t even know what’s between us  
But you caught my attention; but you caught my attention!  

**[Chorus]**  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, I was captivated  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, I was captivated  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, but you caught my attention  
Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes, notes
