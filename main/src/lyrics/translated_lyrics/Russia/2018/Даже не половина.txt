**[Intro]**  
This night will cover us like an avalanche  
But you’re not love, not even half of it  
Baby, undressed, sweet girl  
What are we doing?

**[Verse 1]**  
She’s burning with her gaze, like it’s an ultrasound  
Like it’s an ultrasound - she’s the hottest at the party  
She knows I’m going crazy  
If I say I’m not losing my mind  
Then I’m just lying to myself  
And as darkness falls  
We switch to “you”  
Your suitor has cooled off, but I’m with you  
As if I never left  
You’re flirting one moment, then playing hard to get  
You’re not a loyal husky, more like a whirlpool  
Call a car from the club  
Away from silly girlfriends and fake friends  
And where are we going? To where our eyes look  
To where you weren’t supposed to go  
And we’re not a couple at all  
Because we’re not even friends

**[Chorus]**  
This night will cover us like an avalanche  
But you’re not love, not even half of it  
Baby, undressed, sweet girl  
What are we doing, stop me  
This night will cover us like an avalanche  
But you’re not love, not even half of it  
Baby, undressed, sweet girl  
What are we doing?

**[Verse 2]**  
This isn’t love, it’s all pheromones  
Today it’s you and me, tomorrow I’m solo  
But what happens tomorrow doesn’t matter  
I want you, and I’ll take you away  
And we’ll do everything, forget the rules  
This girl is stunning - it’s an effect  
We’re flying over the avenue, catching the moment  
We live as if tomorrow doesn’t exist  
Up, down, let’s do it again  
Down, up, we’ll explode here like fireworks  
Fireworks, and really, like in a movie  
We’ll be covered head to toe - it’s a domino effect  
I’ve held myself back for so long, baby  
But you’re so close, let’s break the record

**[Chorus]**  
This night will cover us like an avalanche  
But you’re not love, not even half of it  
Baby, undressed, sweet girl  
What are we doing, stop me  
This night will cover us like an avalanche  
But you’re not love, not even half of it  
Baby, undressed, sweet girl  
What are we doing?  
This night will cover us like an avalanche  
But you’re not love, not even half of it  
Baby, undressed, sweet girl  
What are we doing!
