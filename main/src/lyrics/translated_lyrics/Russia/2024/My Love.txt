**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
My love  
Somewhere far away  
Somewhere distant  
Love  
I’m with you, light as a feather  
It’s not about the cash, oh  
I’m not a mannequin  
You pull me into your trap, hey, oh  
Blinded by the beauty  
Of your knees  
My love  
Somewhere far away  
Somewhere distant  
Love  
I’m with you, light as a feather  
It’s not about the cash, oh  
I’m not a mannequin  
You pull me into your trap, hey, oh  
Blinded by the beauty  
Of your knees  
My love  

**[Verse 1]**  
In the morning, I’m sick with longing for you  
In the evening, under the influence of alcohol  
Tequila with salt again  
Baby, I’m sorry  
Oh, how you’re so untouchable  
I stole you and took you with me  
Fendi, Gucci, Cartier at the door  
But you only give me pain  
I have a magazine  
Loaded with your beauty  
A shot to the heart  
But it doesn’t hurt  
It broke through the stone  
Next to my soul  
Oh, how you’re so untouchable  
But I still dive into the fight  
You’re stylish  
I’m serious  
Oh my love  
My love (No, no, no, wait)  

**[Chorus]**  
My love  
Somewhere far away  
Somewhere distant  
Love  
I’m with you, light as a feather  
It’s not about the cash, oh  
I’m not a mannequin  
You pull me into your trap, hey, oh  
Blinded by the beauty  
Of your knees  
My love  
Somewhere far away  
Somewhere distant  
Love  
I’m with you, light as a feather  
It’s not about the cash, oh  
I’m not a mannequin  
You pull me into your trap, hey, oh  
Blinded by the beauty  
Of your knees  
My love  

**[Verse 2]**  
Something warms in my chest  
I know — it’s your love  
Moscow burns like your eyes  
Forget your worries, we’re flying today  
To where there’s no one but us  
No rules, we’re pressing the gas  
One, two, three  
Look at you  
I’ve spent myself  
I have lines, roads, and pain  
Without you, my soul is just minor  
I stole your heart, I’m a thief  
Morning, evening, nights with you  
Forever drunk, forever young  
Evenings together under the moon  
Not a romantic, but for you, I’m ready  
My love  

**[Chorus]**  
My love  
Somewhere far away  
Somewhere distant  
Love  
I’m with you, light as a feather  
It’s not about the cash, oh  
I’m not a mannequin  
You pull me into your trap, hey, oh  
Blinded by the beauty  
Of your knees  
My love  
Somewhere far away  
Somewhere distant  
Love  
I’m with you, light as a feather  
It’s not about the cash, oh  
I’m not a mannequin  
You pull me into your trap, hey, oh  
Blinded by the beauty  
Of your knees  
My love
