**[Intro]**  
Maybe we shouldn't rush the night  
And repeat everything from the start?  
Let's repeat everything from the start  
Oh, what should I do?  

**[Chorus]**  
Maybe we shouldn't rush the night  
And repeat everything from the start?  
Let's repeat everything from the start  
Oh, what should I do?  
Maybe we should start all over again?  
I don't want to lose you  
I can't afford to lose you  
Oh, what should I do?  

**[Verse]**  
Well, how, how should I be, tell me, my dear  
I don't know how to be with you  
And your eyes are like oceans  
I drown in them again, I'm sinking  
Where is my lifebuoy?  
How did you get away with this?  
You're neither an enemy nor a friend  
Only a sound remains in my head  
Tick-tock, tick-tock  
And my heart has chosen wrong again  
But without her, I can't go on  
You hurt me, you fool  
What was I thinking?  
I thought it would let go by morning  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Let the fog clear and everything fade away  
But why aren't you here beside me?  
You're not with me, and I can't believe it  
How can I bring everything back, rewind it?  

**[Chorus]**  
Maybe we shouldn't rush the night  
And repeat everything from the start?  
Let's repeat everything from the start  
Oh, what should I do?  
Maybe we should start all over again?  
I don't want to lose you  
I can't afford to lose you  
Oh, what should I do?  

**[Outro]**  
Maybe we shouldn't rush the night  
And repeat everything from the start?  
Let's repeat everything from the start  
Oh, what should I do?
