**[Intro: FEDUK, Элджей & Ваня Караулов]**  
I look like a bird, or (Like a prince?)  
A prince or an eagle (Hey)  
I grab a second bottle of rosé wine  
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, phew, Sayonara Boy, Feduk One Love  
One Love, Sayonara Boy, yeah  

**[Chorus: FEDUK]**  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
The magic of colors with ice in our glasses  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
The magic of colors with ice in our glasses  

**[Verse 1: Элджей]**  
Friday girl doesn’t want to be alone today (Ha-ha, ha-ha)  
What does it matter where I am? I don’t answer calls (Calls)  
You can even not call (Pr, pr), you can even not call (No-no)  
We want to have fun (Want to have fun), I want to have fun (Want to have fun)  

**[Bridge: Элджей]**  
We’re already in an ocean of parties, alcohol, and marijuana  
No stress, munching like M&M's, dance-dance (Dance?)  
Kiss-kiss, breathe me in through the kiss, through the kiss (Through the kiss)  
My magic wand is in your hands, crackle-pop  

**[Pre-Chorus: Элджей]**  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing (Ha-ha)  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
Purple cotton candy, and everything around is so awesome  
Your friends are losers, and I’m out of my mind (Ha-ha)  
But let’s not play cat and mouse  
Your palms have gone too far  
I want you, and I also want to chill  

**[Chorus: FEDUK]**  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
The magic of colors with ice in our glasses (Ha)  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
The magic of colors with ice in our glasses  

**[Verse 2: FEDUK]**  
I would live in this summer, in that very moment  
When we were riding on a bike (Vroom)  
These palms and the wind, palms and the wind  
Like palms in a crimson sunset  
We glide and roll on the crest of the wave  
Spending everything we’ve saved for so long  
And everything we’ve saved for so long  
You’ll have to spend it today, yeah  

**[Pre-Chorus: FEDUK]**  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  

**[Chorus: FEDUK & Элджей]**  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah (Uh-huh)  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
The magic of colors with ice in our glasses (Ah)  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
These clouds are purple cotton candy  
The magic of colors with ice in our glasses  

**[Outro: FEDUK]**  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb  
It’s so beautiful here, I stop breathing, yeah  
Sounds turned down low, so we don’t disturb
