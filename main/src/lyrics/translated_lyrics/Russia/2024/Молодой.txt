**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, I’m just a simple, simple guy  
With an empty, empty wallet inside  
Girls don’t want one like me, no way  
But I don’t mind, I’m still young today  
Lonely and young,  
My soul hasn’t aged at all,  
I don’t know how to live in sorrow,  
Because I’m playful after all.  
Sometimes it seems to me, I’ll stay forever young,  
For my soul sings out loud,  
Won’t let me live calm and proud.  
Lonely, yet young,  
With an interesting fate,  
And with an open heart,  
I warm myself with dreams that start.  
I don’t suffer from madness,  
My mind is perfectly fine,  
I know I’m getting older,  
But in my heart, I’m still in my prime.  
Simple,  
I’m not rich and not handsome, but I’m just me,  
Let time pull my years along, you’ll see.  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh.  
Oh, I’m just a simple, simple guy  
With an empty, empty wallet inside  
Girls don’t want one like me, no way  
But I don’t mind, I’m still young today.
