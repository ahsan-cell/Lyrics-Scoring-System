**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
Today I’ll allow myself to be the happiest of all  
I’m walking through the scorched field as the sun starts to fall  
Can you feel it? It’s joy with tears in my eyes  
Look, the sun has already set, yet I’m still on my feet  

**[Verse 1]**  
I searched for the bad one, but found the wrong kind  
Didn’t find the bad one  
The wind blew from the sea, chasing my dreams  
I’m jealous of you  
The sky will be painted by rain of burning stones  
Beauty will shatter the world of happy people  
Next to you is a place of power — it’s beautiful  
Call me yours, and I’ll become happy  

**[Chorus]**  
Today I’ll allow myself to be the happiest of all  
I’m walking through the scorched field as the sun starts to fall  
Can you feel it? It’s joy with tears in my eyes  
Look, the sun has already set, yet I’m still on my feet  

**[Verse 2]**  
We were honest friends, and we’ll stay friends  
Like the Moon with the Earth  
We loved purely and will continue to love  
Strong like an asteroid  
I found you by signs, my dear, the only one  
Comets kiss the Earth, so kiss me too  
Next to you is a place of power — it’s beautiful  
Call me yours, and I’ll become happy  

**[Chorus]**  
Today I’ll allow myself to be the happiest of all  
I’m walking through the scorched field as the sun starts to fall  
Can you feel it? It’s joy with tears in my eyes  
Look, the sun has already set, yet I’m still on my feet  
Today I’ll allow myself to be the happiest of all  
I’m walking through the scorched field as the sun starts to fall  
Can you feel it? It’s joy with tears in my eyes  
Look, the sun has already set, yet I’m still on my feet
