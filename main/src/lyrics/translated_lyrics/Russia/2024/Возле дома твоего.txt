**[Verse 1]**  
I remember passing by,  
Just passing by, (Just passing by)  
And a light rain was falling,  
Rain was falling, rain was falling (Rain was falling)  
When I saw you there,  
Right then I saw you, (Right then I saw you)  
My heart stopped beating,  
Stopped beating, stopped beating.

**[Chorus]**  
And I decided to write you a boy's rap,  
And I decided to write you a boy's rap,  
And I decided to write you a boy's rap,  
And I'll sing it for you  
By your house,  
By your house (by your house)  
By your house, by your home,  
By your house (I'll sing it for you)  
By your house,  
By your house (by your house)  
By your house, by your home,  
By your house,  
I'll sing it for you.

**[Bridge]**  
I'll drive past your house in my BMW,  
When the light appears in the second-floor window,  
And once again, Sergey's lines echo in my head,  
Like a lullaby (La-la-la-la-la)  
You gave me the world,  
You spoiled me,  
My other half,  
I need you more and more,  
More and more,  
More and more of you,  
La-la-la-la-la.

**[Chorus]**  
And I decided to write you a boy's rap,  
And I decided to write you a boy's rap,  
And I decided to write you a boy's rap,  
And I'll sing it for you  
By your house,  
By your house (by your house)  
By your house, by your home,  
By your house (I'll sing it for you)  
By your house,  
By your house (by your house)  
By your house, by your home,  
By your house,  
I'll sing it for you.  
My dear, you caught me so,  
That I couldn't go a day without thinking of you,  
The rain was falling, I looked into your eyes,  
By your house in my BMW.
