**[Intro: Tessa Violet]**  
Uh, alright  

**[Verse 1]**  
Your Core i5 is struggling to keep up  
Don’t you want to get up from that bottle, huh?  
To feel the rush and the awesome speed?  
Then buy a Ryzen and forget about that Xeon, ah!  

**[Bridge]**  
Sell your blue junk on Avito  
Or better yet, just throw it in the trash!  
You’ve got a busted blue rear end—stitch it up, stitch it up  
(Yeah)  

**[Verse 2]**  
Bought an i5, means your brain’s in trouble  
Without hyper-threading, it’s all just nonsense, huh!  
Without hyper-threading, life’s not the same  
Busted rear ends for those who own that junk, ah!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Sell your blue junk on Avito  
Or better yet, just throw it in the trash!  
You’ve got a busted blue rear end—stitch it up, stitch it up!  

**[Chorus: RX4D & Tessa Violet]**  
Better buy a Ryzen, the 2700 Ryzen  
It’ll handle everything you want  
Games, streaming, rendering—it does it all  
And overclocking, overclocking, overclocking, overclocking  
Is essential, that junk over there, over there, over there, over there  
And look, there’s that junk  
Ryzen’s blowing it away  
They’re pushing overpriced i7s on you  
But we know who’s the boss here  
Two seven hundred, seven hundred, seven hundred, seven hundred  
The best CPU in the world, world, world, world, world  
Two seven hundred, sorry  

**[Verse 3]**  
Sunny boy didn’t want to get an RX  
Sunny boy wanted an RTX  
Went into debt to buy that crap  
But still ended up turning off the RTX, ah!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Sell your green junk on Avito  
Or better yet, just throw it in the trash!  
You’ve got a busted green rear end—stitch it up, stitch it up!  

**[Chorus]**  
Better buy a Vega, the 56 Vega  
It’ll handle everything you want  
Games, streaming, rendering—you can VR with it  
Power, power, power, power, power  
Want to overclock, want to, want to, want to, want to?  
And look, there’s a Ryzen, the 2700 Ryzen  
It’ll handle everything you want  
Games, streaming, rendering—it does it all  
And overclocking, overclocking, overclocking, overclocking  
Is essential, that junk over there, over there, over there, over there  
Get lost, loser 4
