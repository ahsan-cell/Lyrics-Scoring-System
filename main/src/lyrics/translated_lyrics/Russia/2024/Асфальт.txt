**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Jakone]**  
Hello, hello, the connection's gone again  
This cold ignores your summer's end  
I don’t read, just scroll through my feed  
But you read my words, yet no reply indeed  
I dream of seeing you right here  
But I think it’s better for you, my dear  
I’ll stay in this sad dance alone  
And I can’t sing like this anymore, I’ve grown  
Half-drunk, half-soaked in the rain  
Your tears melt into my palm, a bittersweet pain  
I don’t even know who I’m singing about  
You’re all different, like a kaleidoscope, no doubt  
You’re watching my steps, so many calls  
Cards on the table, guns on the walls  
You ask me to leave, I plead for you to stay  
Put my love back in its place today  

**[Chorus: Kiliana, Kiliana & Jakone]**  
The asphalt's wet, just like my eyes  
I’m driving around the MKAD* skies  
It’s springtime here, but I feel so empty, like my tank  
Leave me, trade me for girls and some fun, I’ll be frank  
I know that you know, that I know you’re there  
The asphalt's wet, just like my eyes  
I’m driving around the MKAD skies  
It’s springtime here, but I feel so empty, like my tank  
Leave me, trade me for girls and some fun, I’ll be frank  
I know that you know, that I know you’re there  

**[Verse 2: Kiliana]**  
Hello, how are you? I’m singing to you now  
And it seems to echo back in spring somehow  
I’m not with him, and you’re not with her  
We didn’t get to explain, it’s all a blur  
But you trapped yourself, fell down once more  
Your five-star mess has shaken the core  
You’re watching, watching, watching my profile  
You’re burning everything, flowers aren’t worthwhile  
Let me believe again, please stop this fight  
You’re not an enemy yet, hold on tight  
I knew about the new one, you have one last chance  
(The asphalt's wet, just like my…)

**[Chorus: Kiliana, Kiliana & Jakone]**  
The asphalt's wet, just like my eyes  
I’m driving around the MKAD skies  
It’s springtime here, but I feel so empty, like my tank  
Leave me, trade me for girls and some fun, I’ll be frank  
I know that you know, that I know you’re there  
The asphalt's wet, just like my eyes  
I’m driving around the MKAD skies  
It’s springtime here, but I feel so empty, like my tank  
Leave me, trade me for girls and some fun, I’ll be frank  
I know that you know, that I know you’re there
