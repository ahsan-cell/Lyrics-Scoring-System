Sayonara Boys

**[Pre-Chorus: Ruki Vverh!]**  
Don't be mad at me, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Don't rush to leave, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Stay for a second, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Chorus: Ruki Vverh!, Ruki Vverh! & Eldzhey]**  
Don't be mad at me, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Don't rush to leave, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Stay for a second, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Verse 1: Eldzhey]**  
I call you to come with me (Oh-oh)  
Though I don't know your name (Uh-uh)  
Clouds above my head  
White like Lacalut (Uh-uh)  
Birds aren't flying south  
Because they sing for us (Uh-uh)  
In my accounts, love  
Is the best currency  

**[Refrain: Eldzhey & Ruki Vverh!]**  
Don't say no (Yo), don't say yes (Yeah)  
You can't escape from me anywhere (Ah-ah)  
Don't say no (Yo), don't say yes (Yeah)  
Just don't say anything, words aren't needed here  

**[Pre-Chorus: Ruki Vverh!]**  
Don't be mad at me, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Don't rush to leave, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Stay for a second, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Chorus: Ruki Vverh!, Ruki Vverh! & Eldzhey]**  
Don't be mad at me, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Don't rush to leave, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Stay for a second, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Verse 2: Eldzhey]**  
The music gently rocks  
Like a mother’s lullaby (Oh)  
We’ve frozen out everyone  
To move to the hotel (Yeah)  
It rocks so gently  
Like a mother’s lullaby  
Everyone wants you for themselves  
You're a fresh model  

**[Refrain: Eldzhey & Ruki Vverh!]**  
Don't say no (Meow), don't say yes (No)  
You can't escape from me anywhere (Ah-ah)  
Don't say no (Yo), don't say yes (Yeah)  
Just don't say anything, words aren't needed here (Shh)  

**[Pre-Chorus: Ruki Vverh! & Eldzhey]**  
Don't be mad at me, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Don't rush to leave, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Stay for a second, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na (Yeah)  

**[Chorus: Ruki Vverh!, Ruki Vverh! & Eldzhey]**  
Don't be mad at me, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Don't rush to leave, na-na-na-na-na-na  
Stay for a second, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Outro: Ruki Vverh!]**  
Na-na-na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you, na-na-na-na-na-na  
I just want to be with you
