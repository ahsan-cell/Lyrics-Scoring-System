**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Mari Kraimbrery]  
I’m all dressed up in sneakers, though I seem grown-up  
And there are too many questions about the past, overall  
Tonight I was just listening to a song  
Thinking of you while you sleep  
Everyone’s so curious about who my boyfriend is, but what really bothers me is  
If I let go – it won’t suit you, right?  
You know I can make you laugh, even through emojis  
I’ve pieced this together in my mind  
And it’s spinning me around so cool

[Pre-Chorus: HammAli & Mari Kraimbrery]  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance

[Chorus: HammAli & Mari Kraimbrery]  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance  
Girl – slow dance, boy – the street  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance  
Girl – slow dance, boy – the street  

[Verse 2: HammAli]  
You’re not like everyone else (Like everyone), you’re not from this planet (Yeah)  
Your infectious laughter hides all the pain, though I shouldn’t mention it  
You can’t hide this sadness from me – I see it all (I know everything) I read you through your eyes  
We’re somewhat alike, yeah  
Both of us are lost in our heads  
Before you, yeah, I was different  
Before me, yeah, you were different  
Apparently, restrictions aren’t for us  
We’re learning together anyway  
I found in you what I was searching for (Searching) – I found peace  
You’re afraid to admit it (What’s up?), but you keep giving yourself away (Caught)  
In your blue eyes, like the sea, there’s only honest words (I)  
Conversations about jealousy, you ask: “What will happen tomorrow?”  
I hadn’t thought about it, because I’m drawn to you  
I really like you, honestly (Honestly, honestly)

[Pre-Chorus: HammAli & Mari Kraimbrery]  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance

[Chorus: HammAli & Mari Kraimbrery]  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance  
Girl – slow dance, boy – the street  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance  
Girl – slow dance, boy – the street  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance  
Girl – slow dance, boy – the street  
It’s spinning me around so much, it’s hard to believe  
Maybe my whole life will change  
It’s spinning me around so much, I can’t help but dance  
Girl – slow dance, boy – the street
