**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: HammAli & Navai]  
Why are you awake again?  
I was told that you’re feeling blue.  
Well, do you want me to come to you?  
Well, do you want me to...

[Verse 1: HammAli]  
You loved me as I am,  
In a way that’s impossible to love me (No, no).  
Though things aren’t so sweet with you,  
You know that you’re like air to me.  
I touch your lips with my hands,  
You drop tears with your fingers.  
I’m your friend, I’m saving you,  
Know that I won’t leave you alone.  
I don’t want you to cry, cry, I’ll come to you.  
I don’t want you to cry, cry, just wait for me.  
Even if there are hundreds of kilometers between us,  
I’ll come to find out why you’re not sleeping.  
So many days and nights,  
Only with her and her,  
I feel at peace.  
You catch my text again,  
“Come on, step outside! I’m standing by your house.”  
Hey!

[Chorus: HammAli & Navai]  
Why are you awake again?  
I was told that you’re feeling blue.  
Well, do you want me to come to you?  
Well, do you want me to...  
Why are you awake again?  
I was told that you’re feeling blue.  
Well, do you want me to come to you?  
Well, do you want me to...

[Bridge: HammAli & Navai]  
I don’t want you to cry, cry, I’ll come to you.  
I don’t want you to cry, cry, just wait for me.  
I’ll come to you...  
I’ll come to you...

[Verse 2: Navai]  
I’m back at work again,  
You’re busy with your cares.  
You cooked, but the dinner’s gone cold.  
We spend so little time together.  
I’m not there, please forgive me,  
But please, at least today don’t be sad.  
I’m busy, don’t call me - I’m busy.  
Another pile of work, damn, so many tasks again.  
I’m tired, and I just want to hug you,  
And breaking free, I’m racing down the highway to you, I’m speeding again.

[Chorus: HammAli & Navai]  
Why are you awake again?  
I was told that you’re feeling blue.  
Well, do you want me to come to you?  
Well, do you want me to...  
Why are you awake again?  
I was told that you’re feeling blue.  
Well, do you want me to come to you?  
Well, do you want me to...

[Bridge: HammAli & Navai]  
I don’t want you to cry, cry, I’ll come to you.  
I don’t want you to cry, cry, just wait for me.  
I’ll come to you...  
I’ll come to you...

[Outro: Navai]  
The cold has wrapped around us,  
You’re home all alone again.  
The last glass of wine,  
And once more, you’re waiting for me.  
The cold has wrapped around us,  
You’re home all alone again.  
The last glass of wine,  
And once more, you’re waiting for me.  
Once more, you’re waiting for me.  
Once more, you’re waiting for me.  
Once more, you’re waiting for me.
