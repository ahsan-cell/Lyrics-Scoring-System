**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
From thirst, it's unbearable  
My interest is purely sport  
I follow you like in the movies  
Without you, I'm lost  
Your taste, my spark  
Smoke to the ceiling  
I want more  

**[Chorus]**  
Let’s not think of anything  
Except our planet  
We’ll drown in unison  
Together with our secret  
And whatever happens  
Under one sky, it’s you and me  
We erase the boundaries, just you and I  
Let’s not think of anything  
Except our planet  
We’ll drown in unison  
Together with our secret  
And whatever happens  
Under one sky, it’s you and me  
We erase the boundaries, just you and I  
Let’s not think  

**[Verse 2]**  
Inside you, my rock, rock  
From A to Z, your personal blend  
We’re overflowing, losing control  
I want another sip  
But we keep dragging it out  
Our space is only tactile  
I know all your spots  
You’re not shy to give in to me  
I’ll read between the lines  
Love is a hint, I want more  

**[Chorus]**  
Let’s not think of anything  
Except our planet  
We’ll drown in unison  
Together with our secret  
And whatever happens  
Under one sky, it’s you and me  
We erase the boundaries, just you and I  
Let’s not think of anything  
Except our planet  
We’ll drown in unison  
Together with our secret  
And whatever happens  
Under one sky, it’s you and me  
We erase the boundaries, just you and I  
Let’s not think of anything  
Except our planet  
We’ll drown in unison  
Together with our secret  
And whatever happens  
Under one sky, it’s you and me  
We erase the boundaries, just you and I  
Let’s not think
