**[Intro]**  
Ooh  
This girl  

**[Chorus]**  
This girl from the picture  
I love the hair ties she wears  
Just don’t split us in half  
I love her, she loves parties  
(My girl, this girl from the picture)  

**[Verse 1]**  
What dress? She prefers sportswear  
You left the chat, you’re a mistake for her  
She’ll walk away, leaving only fragments in memory  
She’ll hit the party and gather all the cream  

**[Bridge]**  
This girl is top-notch (Whoa)  
Better than Photoshop (Yeah)  
A bullet in the heart, like a Glock (Pew)  
You’re not ready for her (Nope)  
Thoughts are creeping in (Creeping in)  
These lines are for songs (Songs)  
She’s not around, yeah, it’s annoying (Annoying)  
But once you’re in love — go for it (—Go for it)  

**[Chorus]**  
This girl from the picture  
I love the hair ties she wears  
Just don’t split us in half  
I love her, she loves parties  
(My girl) This girl from the picture  
I love the hair ties she wears  
Just don’t split us in half  
I love her, she loves parties  
(My girl, this girl from the picture)  

**[Verse 2]**  
What shoes? She prefers sneakers  
You won’t know where her tattoos are  
She’ll leave, she doesn’t care about your tricks  
But I know what our ending will be  
I love her body, sweet like Nutella  
Taking off her Margiela, everything inside goes numb  
This baby is a dream, there’s no one like her  
But you’re right about one thing, there’s a gap between us  

**[Bridge]**  
This girl is top-notch (Whoa)  
Better than Photoshop (Yeah)  
A bullet in the heart, like a Glock (Pew)  
You’re not ready for her (Nope)  
Thoughts are creeping in (Creeping in)  
These lines are for songs (Songs)  
She’s not around, yeah, it’s annoying (Annoying)  
But once you’re in love — go for it (—Go for it)  

**[Chorus]**  
This girl from the picture  
I love the hair ties she wears  
Just don’t split us in half  
I love her, she loves parties  
(My girl) This girl from the picture  
I love the hair ties she wears  
Just don’t split us in half  
I love her, she loves parties  
(My girl, this girl from the picture)  

**[Outro]**  
This girl from the picture  
Whoa  
My girl
