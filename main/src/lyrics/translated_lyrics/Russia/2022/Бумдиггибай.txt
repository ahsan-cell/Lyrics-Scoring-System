**Translated Lyrics:**

Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Close your eyes, just close them tight  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
In the cradle, sadness has laid to rest  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  

Just slices of heart and a couple sips of soul  
Give me something to smother this pain whole  
I need a doctor to silence these feelings  
Remove the shards  
Cradle boom-diggy-bye-bye  
I don’t believe your words, just so you know  
I can’t forget your “Goodbye!”  
I can’t, forgive me...  

Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Close your eyes, just close them tight  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
In the cradle, sadness has laid to rest  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  

Don’t turn my world upside down again  
Let go, sleep, take the memories with you  
Turn all nightmares into dreams of light  
We must keep living, we must keep drifting  
But I can’t stop loving you  
I can’t forget your “Forgive me!”  
I can’t forgive...  

Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Close your eyes, just close them tight  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
In the cradle, sadness has laid to rest  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  

Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Boom-diggy-bye-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye!  
Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Boom-diggy-bye-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye!  
Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Boom-diggy-bye-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye!  
Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  

Mixed-up thoughts, broken feelings  
Fifty shades of sorrow from enchanted love  
I understand, you won’t let go  
You test me, torment me  
But you won’t have me  
I ask — let love be free  

Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Close your eyes, just close them tight  
Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  
In the cradle, sadness has laid to rest  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  

Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Boom-diggy-bye-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye!  
Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Boom-diggy-bye-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye!  
Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Boom-diggy-bye-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye!  
Boom-diggy-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away  

Boom-bye, boom-diggy-bye-bye  
Sleep now, my love, sleep away
