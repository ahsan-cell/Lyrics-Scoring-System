**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Faik with Rauf]  
Take me, love me, cover me  
With that veil we created together  
Take me, love me, cover me  
With that veil we created together  
Take me, love me, cover me  
With that veil we created together  
Take me, love me, cover me  
With that veil we created together  

[Verse 1: Rauf]  
I remember that night I closed your eyes, the door of grandma's house  
And the stairwell, as we descended together  
Parks, scandals, love, memoirs, songs about love  
With you forever, I ask you, remember me  

[Refrain]  
I walked you home to the sounds of birds  
You fell asleep on my lap  
And I knocked on grandma's door  
I walk through the whole corridor, and you’re still asleep  
"Don't get up, baby," you tell me  

[Chorus: Faik with Rauf]  
Take me, love me, cover me  
With that veil we created together  
Take me, love me, cover me  
With that veil we created together  

[Verse 2: Rauf with Faik]  
The streetlights dance along the street  
Look into my eyes, I’ll tell you everything  
And I’ll sing you a lullaby, look into my eyes  
And where is the kindness in them? (Where is the kindness in them?)  

[Refrain]  
I walked you home to the sounds of birds  
You fell asleep on my lap  
And I knocked on grandma's door  
I walk through the whole corridor, and you’re still asleep  
"Don't get up, baby," you tell me  

[Outro]

Ney-ney-na-na-ney  
Ney-ney-na-na-ney  
Ney-ney-na-na-ney
