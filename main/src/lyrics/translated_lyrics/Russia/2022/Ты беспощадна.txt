**[Intro]**  
You are merciless  
When you're dressed up  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
All my wounds  
Are your reward  
We are not together  
We are not together  
We are not together  

**[Chorus]**  
You are merciless  
When you're dressed up  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
All my wounds  
Are your reward  
We are not together  
We are not together  
We are not together  

**[Verse]**  
First half, month of May  
So much, just know  
I forget the scent of paradise  
Drown in my thoughts  
Well, come on, guess  
I'm in the dark and I can't see the end  
Night, moon, silence  
Like a wave, hereâ€™s the price  
What have I become? Trampled down  
Forgotten and flipped through  
Those places, where's the star?  
Led us to our dream  

**[Bridge]**  
You are merciless  
When you're dressed up  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
All my wounds  
Are your reward  
We are not together  
We are not together  
We are not together  

**[Chorus]**  
You are merciless  
When you're dressed up  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
All my wounds  
Are your reward  
We are not together  
We are not together  
We are not together  
You are merciless  
When you're dressed up  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
You burn with fire  
All my wounds  
Are your reward  
We are not together  
We are not together  
We are not together
