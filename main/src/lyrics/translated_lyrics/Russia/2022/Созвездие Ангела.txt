**[Intro]**  
Okay, uh  

**[Verse 1]**  
Rhythms intertwine with the threads of words  
Filling my insides with lines  
And once again, my soul doesn’t understand what’s happening to it  
But I feel how it sings  
I feel its intoxication from an otherworldly image  
The image of my simple girl  
I feel how the verse sends me your gaze  
Guiding me like a guiding star  
The sunny hue of cracks on your lips  
A quiet harmony of your smile  
I’m your brute, your psychopath, and your musician  
You’re the sunbeams in my Antarctica  
It’s a pity I can’t explain all this out loud  
It’s easier to express it in melody  
All my emotions I lay out here in a song about my love  

**[Bridge]**  
Hold me tighter with your hand  
Don’t doubt, I’m with you  
For I feel good and easy with you  
This feeling is so extraordinary  
And we’re somewhere far away  
Somewhere above the earth, somewhere high  
High, high, high above the sky  

**[Chorus]**  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel  

**[Verse 2]**  
We’re speeding up the hands in our biorhythm  
People rush home so fast  
I look into your closed eyes  
I watch how gently they sleep  
Busy with beaten problems  
Caught up in routine as always  
Tested by everyday life  
But we don’t care about this fuss  
Baby, remember how many times  
Remember how many days, remember how many dawns  
We met together  
How many warm phrases, time at the bottom  
How much I remember us, I remember our strong love  
I remember every moment, every sunbeam  
That caressed your curls in the morning  
I remember every glance, I remember how your soul  
Touched me to the depths of my heart  

**[Bridge]**  
Hold me tighter with your hand  
Don’t doubt, I’m with you  
For I feel good and easy with you  
This feeling is so extraordinary  
And we’re somewhere far away  
Somewhere above the earth, somewhere high  
High, high, high above the sky  

**[Chorus]**  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel, angel, angel  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel, angel, angel  

**[Bridge: Female Voice]**  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel, angel, angel...  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel, angel, angel...  

**[Chorus]**  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel  
Where another galaxy lies  
Where the constellation of an angel is  
It shines in your eyes  
A beautiful constellation of an angel
