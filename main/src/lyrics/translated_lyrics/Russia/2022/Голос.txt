**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Heart Break Kid  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars  
On my bed, your hair  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  

[Chorus]  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars (No, no)  
On my bed, your hair (Shining)  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars (No, no)  
On my bed, your hair (Shining)  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  

[Verse 1]  
Whoa, this gin erases insecurities (Oh yeah), yeah  
Like asphalt erases Converse  
The girl from the picture became a comic book girl (Like Marvel)  
But then she disappeared — magic tricks  
Yeah, sometimes I can be rough (Ha)  
I know I don't seem like a one-woman man  
I said I didn't like your friends (Oh no)  
In the end, all your friends are my groupies (Facts)  

[Bridge]  
I removed everything sharp from the house — I'm not talking about food  
Because those lines on your body don’t suit you  
I know it hurts to see emptiness instead of pain  
And it's so hard for me to forget all your simplicity  

[Chorus]  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars (No, no)  
On my bed, your hair (Shining)  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars (No, no)  
On my bed, your hair (Shining)  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  

[Verse 2]  
Everything inside me turns to ice (Ice)  
Everything always passes, but right now it won't  
But there are so many "buts," everything is the opposite (The opposite)  
Like you're not the one, like I'm not the one (Not the one)  
Our paths diverge — that's normal  
We'll be separated to avoid bumping heads  
Everything will be forgotten sooner or later  
Love is such a thing — it leaves scars (Facts)  

[Bridge]  
I removed everything sharp from the house — I'm not talking about food  
Because those lines on your body don’t suit you  
I know it hurts to see emptiness instead of pain  
And it's so hard for me to forget all your simplicity  

[Pre-Chorus]  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars  
On my bed, your hair  
I replay the voice notes with your voice (Ha-ha-ha)  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  

[Chorus]  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars (No, no)  
On my bed, your hair (Shining)  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own  
On my wrist, Rolexes, and underneath — scars (No, no)  
On my bed, your hair  
I replay the voice notes with your voice  
You know, I can't handle this pain on my own
