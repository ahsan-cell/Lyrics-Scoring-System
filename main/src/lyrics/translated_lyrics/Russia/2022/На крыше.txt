**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Your name plus mine on the wall  
The whole neighborhood knows about you and me  
Watching from above, the whole world is in view  
Amidst the hustle, but on the rooftop, we’re all alone  
Little people, but with huge dreams  
A small heart waits for a great love  
But don’t rush, don’t chase time  
And remember this moment  

**[Chorus]**  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time  

**[Verse 2]**  
But tomorrow I’ll wake up alone again  
I wait for you, though there are a million others  
I’ll search for you again in the crowd  
As if I’m not myself, as if the world has split  
Do you want to just be silent?  
Or should I come to you, leave the keys?  
We’ll paint our life ourselves  
For there are thousands of reasons to do so!  

**[Chorus]**  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time  

**[Verse 3]**  
With the years, we’ve grown even stronger  
I’m grateful to God and to fate  
I’m real, and my love for you  
Is just the same as on that very first day  
With the years, we’ve grown even stronger  
I’ll fly in, even on one wing  
I’ll find the way even in the dark  
To tell you about love once more  

**[Bridge]**  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time  

**[Chorus]**  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time  
On the rooftops of the city’s buildings  
We hid from prying eyes  
I kissed you then  
For the very first time
