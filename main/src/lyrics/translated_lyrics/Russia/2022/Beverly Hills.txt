**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
He never had anyone before her  
In this city, like in a casino  
There's an abundance of glamour, a train of mistakes  
He bets everything on zero  
She’s brighter than everyone he’s known  
Her name is on everyone’s lips  
She smells of freedom  
Like a Bond girl  
The wind played through her hair  

[Chorus]  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  

[Post-Chorus]  
I was broken with love  
I was sure you were right  
I will never stop crying  
And I can't breathe anymore  
I was broken with love  
I was sure you were right  
I will never stop crying  
And I can't breathe anymore  

[Verse 2]  
They told her that in Beverly Hills  
A new life begins  
In this world, she feels uncomfortable  
But somehow they found each other  
He prefers to stay in the shadows  
For everyone, he’s just her souvenir  
But she doesn’t care who believes what  
They’ll never know what’s inside  

[Chorus]  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  

[Post-Chorus]  
I was broken with love  
I was sure you were right  
I will never stop crying  
And I can't breathe anymore  
I was broken with love  
I was sure you were right  
I will never stop crying  
And I can't breathe anymore  

[Chorus]  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?  
His eyes are the light of distant comets  
Her love is a moment, but how to repeat it?
