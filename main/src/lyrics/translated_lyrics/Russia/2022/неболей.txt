**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Basta]  
Let it pour from the sky, let it pour  
Let it pour from the sky, let it pour-pour-pour  
Let it pour from the sky, let it rain  
While you wait for me  

[Chorus: Zivert & Basta]  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill (Don’t be ill, oh yeah)  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill  

[Verse 1: Basta & Zivert]  
I could make  
The sun shine brighter, to melt the ice  
You could too  
But between you and me, it’s neither cold nor warm  
(You could too)  
I could smile, but in this song, it’s only minor  
(I could)  
You could too  
But in this story, there are too many “buts”  
(But too many “buts”)  

[Chorus: Zivert & Basta]  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill (Don’t be ill, oh yeah)  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill  

[Verse 2: Basta & Zivert]  
I could explain everything, but that means drawing a conclusion  
You could too  
Because it will end badly, I know it in advance  
(I could)  
I could say sorry, but the lesson was too harsh  
(You could)  
You could too  
But when love leaves, even God is powerless  
(Too many “buts”)  
(Too many “buts”)  

[Chorus: Zivert & Basta]  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill (Don’t be ill, oh yeah)  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill  

[Verse 3: Zivert]  
Is it necessary to be close?  
Feelings are an elevator  
And the higher we are from the ground  
The lighter the flirt  
Not everyone is lucky  
To disregard everything  
I’m once again close to my heart  

[Verse 4: Basta]  
Let it be rain or snow, my home is empty  
The cold of the night, I’ll talk in decibels, I’m not angry  
This is the point, it’s definitely a run-up; I know by heart  
What you’ll say in response, my sadness  
I just didn’t have time, and so what  
Whether in rain or snow, I smoke  
A couple more cigarettes on the edge  
And we’re gone, and we’re gone  

[Chorus: Zivert & Basta]  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill (Don’t be ill, oh yeah)  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill (Don’t be ill, oh yeah)  
Let it pour from the sky  
Let it rain, rain, rain, rain  
While you wait for me, don’t be ill  
Don’t be—don’t be—don’t be—don’t be ill
