**[Intro]**  
Blessed  
Blessed  
Blessed  

**[Verse 1]**  
Blessed in the trap house  
Flow like King Kong  
Haven't written for two days  
I was dying from withdrawal  
You love the long ones, but you're not in the club  
PC from the bald guy, terrible clubs  
It starts somewhere in the evening, ends at dawn  
City's a mess if we're not around  
A never-before-seen dawn is burning... (Damn)  

**[Verse 2: Bayonix, Dmitry Kiselev]**  
Everyone's in tight pants, feels like we're in China  
I'll snap, send it to the can  
You've got stones, I don't measure with clocks  
I see you through an X-ray – I'm cracking up  
Coloboma in your eyes and not just on your face  
You're my opponent – I’m locking on  
If I compare you to an incel (Shot, shot)  
As Kiselev would say:  
Coincidence? I don't think so  

**[Verse 3]**  
Not thinking about you, thinking about bigger things  
How to take the World Cup being Kokorin  
I love living, call me Gorin  
Not Yuri Gagarin, call me Polina  
If you want beef, you’ll be unsatisfied  
Though you’re a punk, your boyfriend’s satisfied  
You were in my crew, now you’re fired (You left)  

**[Verse 4]**  
Changed my circle, only close ones around  
Measured all your actions, they’re low down  
All my brothers are quick on their feet  
Yours are dirty with hands and deeds  
I don’t care about anyone – this is a new story  
Running on the beat, I’m a comet, Jony  

**[Outro: Dmitry Kiselev]**  
We didn’t change the balance  
Just sliced something for a common presentation
