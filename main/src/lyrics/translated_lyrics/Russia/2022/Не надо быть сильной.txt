**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
You don’t need to be strong, I’ll be the strong one  
Just be gentle and love me  
You don’t need to be strong, I’ll be the strong one  
Just be by my side and love me  

[Verse 1]  
I know you’ve suffered a lot, yes  
You were alone for so long  
But now you have me  
You don’t need to run away anywhere  
Or take on too much  
I’ve taken you under my wing  
For I can heal your soul  
I can love you just as you are  
Your smile can disarm me  
In my arms, you can forget everything  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I fell in love with you just like that, just like that  
In a familiar way  
I want our love story  
To run around the house  

[Chorus]  
You don’t need to be strong, I’ll be the strong one  
Just be gentle and love me  
You don’t need to be strong, I’ll be the strong one  
Just be by my side and love me  

[Bridge]  
You’re like my favorite song, you’re like a silent film  
That’s understood without words  
You’re deep in my heart and have been for a long time  
So tenderly composing love  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I fell in love with you just like that, just like that  
In a familiar way  
I want our love story  
To run around the house  

[Chorus]  
You don’t need to be strong, I’ll be the strong one  
Just be gentle and love me  
You don’t need to be strong, I’ll be the strong one  
Just be by my side and love me  

[Outro]  
And love me  
And love me
