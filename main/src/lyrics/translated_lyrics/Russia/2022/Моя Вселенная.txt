**[Intro: Tati]**  
I ask you, just don’t lie to yourself  
You’re half of me, I’m half of you, but we’re not whole  
And we’re neither friends nor enemies  
I’m your flaw, you’re my universe  

**[Chorus: Tati]**  
I ask you, just don’t lie to yourself  
You’re half of me, I’m half of you, but we’re not whole  
And we’re neither friends nor enemies  
I’m your flaw, you’re my universe  

**[Verse 1: WHITE GALLOWS]**  
I’ll be your ocean, you just be my shore  
Two fools in the seats of a BMW Series 8  
Become the question I’d try to solve  
Become the movement, the victory after defeat  
You’re amazing, I’m doomed to love you  
If you were music, I’d put you on repeat  
Let’s try everything again, you’re the half, not the whole  
And I’m the constant hero, not just a cameo, like a brief appearance  
So little from “don’t let me go” to “get your hands off me”  
You’re heading to your idiot now, and I’m off to my made-up girl  
A snowstorm outside, January’s already in the bedroom, and I’m still searching for those sounds  
I’ll write by the skyscraper window all these hooks about you  

**[Chorus: Tati]**  
I ask you, just don’t lie to yourself  
You’re half of me, I’m half of you, but we’re not whole  
And we’re neither friends nor enemies  
I’m your flaw, you’re my universe  

**[Verse 2: Basta & Tati]**  
I wanted so much to prove to myself that I could erase you  
But this love became a lesson, and I learned it by heart  
I’ll play you a new demo about us, you say: “Turn it off”  
Because no matter how much I try to heal you, your heart can’t be healed  
I’m racing through the labyrinths, headlong, trying to find peace  
I keep this pain to later rap my verse about you on the beat in the mic  
The cold district drives me crazy with its night silence, and even if I’m a weakling (I ask you)  
But love can break anyone in a heartbeat  
When I swore to you, I wasn’t lying, and you can hardly lie either  
And who among us was more honest — it doesn’t matter, what matters is who needs the truth more  
I burst into your life elegantly, spinning in a deadly drift  
I thought we were flying together, but it turned out we were falling in an elevator  
I thought I was strong, I believed I could handle it, forced myself to forget you  
I told myself: “I need to distract myself,” change the script of events  
Give me back my half, at least what’s left after  
Even though I loved you so much that I gave all of myself, and to hell with it  
The city of roads rushes us to find our platform in the flow — it’s a battle of worlds  
I lost you like one loses a ticket from a thousand unwritten numbers  
You turned from my pain into a forgotten sad song  
Repost after repost, and this new version will find you  

**[Chorus: Tati]**  
I ask you, just don’t lie to yourself  
You’re half of me, I’m half of you, but we’re not whole  
And we’re neither friends nor enemies  
I’m your flaw, you’re my universe  
I ask you, just don’t lie to yourself  
You’re half of me, I’m half of you, but we’re not whole  
And we’re neither friends nor enemies  
I’m your flaw, you’re my universe
