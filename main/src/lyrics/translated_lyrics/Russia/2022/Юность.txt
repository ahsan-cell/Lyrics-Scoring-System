**[Chorus]**  
Let’s turn the sound up loud, and the neighbors can’t sleep  
To those below us, please forgive me  
And then we’ll talk about love until dawn  
This is my youth, this is my youth  
Let’s turn the sound up loud, and the neighbors can’t sleep  
To those below us, please forgive me  
And then we’ll talk about love until dawn  
This is my youth, this is my youth  

**[Verse 1]**  
I know we definitely won’t sleep tonight  
I know we’ll gaze at the stars until morning light  
Your warmth is in my hands, and the fire glows bright  
It lifts the sparks into the air, such a beautiful sight  
The wind caresses my eyes, the sun sets in the west  
Those who stood by me till the end, I’ll never forget  
And now we’ve grown stronger, but sadness creeps in  
I’ll gather all my friends, and then we’ll begin  

**[Chorus]**  
Let’s turn the sound up loud, and the neighbors can’t sleep  
To those below us, please forgive me  
And then we’ll talk about love until dawn  
This is my youth, this is my youth  
Let’s turn the sound up loud, and the neighbors can’t sleep  
To those below us, please forgive me  
And then we’ll talk about love until dawn  
This is my youth, this is my youth  

**[Verse 2]**  
The whole yard hears the music now  
And we’re playing it on repeat somehow  
The engine roars, we’re rolling ahead  
In the center, the crowd is out, having fun instead  
Hey, turn it up, throw the window wide  
Once again, let Dabro’s sound collide  
A couple of friends, and some girls too  
I won’t betray them, they’re my heart’s dream crew  
Two white braids flying high in the air  
I kiss you on the lips, and you kiss back with care  
Come close to me, just shut the door tight  
I want to be alone with you tonight  
Beyond the wall, the beat and bass boom  
We’re still awake while the whole city’s in gloom  
And I know one thing — our time is on the fly  
Just promise me you won’t be sad, give me a smile  
Never forget, and dream of me once in a while  
I’ll wait for our next meeting, missing your sparkling eyes  
Everything will be fine, but for now, let’s live like it’s our last goodbye  

**[Chorus]**  
Let’s turn the sound up loud, and the neighbors can’t sleep  
To those below us, please forgive me  
And then we’ll talk about love until dawn  
This is my youth, this is my youth  
Let’s turn the sound up loud, and the neighbors can’t sleep  
To those below us, please forgive me  
And then we’ll talk about love until dawn  
This is my youth, this is my youth
