**Translated Lyrics:**

[Pre-Chorus: Alena Omarhalieva]  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  

[Chorus: Alena Omarhalieva]  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  

[Verse 1: Basta]  
I watch the sunrise  
The train has left for the east  
I’m off track, the needle fell past a hundred  
I follow your footprints in the sand, my steps in yours  
And these are my feelings in sugary rhymes  
But my heart is stuck in them, like a ship on the reefs  
Somewhere between black and white keys and guitar frets  
Somewhere between floors in stalled elevators  
This is how my feelings for you sound:  
A loud chorus plus a mundane verse  
I’m off to Tibet, and the wind brings me your laughter  
It’s night here, and snow is falling  
You’re in my heart, and there’s no room left  
Starting from the peak of Everest — special flight  
Turn up the music in the player  
I’m breaking away from Earth  
I’m taking off  
After you  

[Chorus: Alena Omarhalieva]  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  

[Verse 2: Basta]  
To you on rails, on runways, on roads  
Through obstacles, through time and space  
On summer tires in fierce winter  
Whether to the underground kingdom or beyond the Nine Lands  
It’s simple. No excess. Our island. We don’t breathe  
300 incoming calls, but we’re on “silent” mode  
Right now, they don’t matter to me  
A bright plot, we’ll fall asleep in the credits  
This is more important, so we’ll take the risk  
How will the world respond to our bold challenge?  
Naively, childishly, and let it make no sense  
But you inspire even to death  
You’re so beautiful, it hurts to look  
And let everything be against us, the odds not in our favor  
Hold my hand, and don’t let go  

[Refrain]  
Between us, a boundary!  
(Boundary)  

[Chorus: Alena Omarhalieva]  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  
I rise above the ground  
For I feel so good with you  
Hold me tight, don’t let go  
Between us, a boundary  
(Boundary)
