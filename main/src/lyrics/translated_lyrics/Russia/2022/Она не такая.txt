**[Verse 1]**  
The sky, like a jeweler; stars, like crystals  
For you, today I’ll gather them all  
They fall, but know that I’ll collect them all  
I’ll make you a bracelet from them  
You deserve more than the stars I see in this sky  
I could think of another, but all my thoughts are of you  
You walk by, our boys steal a glance  
They only talk about you

**[Chorus]**  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard

**[Verse 2]**  
Once again, I realize I’m not a romantic  
Where to find my own among a thousand galaxies?  
What’s my fault? Where did I go wrong?  
Behind me are mistakes, I didn’t know back then  
How much more will we have to see?  
What else does fate have in store for us?  
I’m responsible for you, just know  
I have so much to tell you  
Not at all the one you wanted  
Why is it so hard to be young?  
And no one has loved me like this  
In this world, there surely aren’t any like her

**[Chorus]**  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard

**[Verse 3]**  
I don’t aim for ideals, you didn’t know much  
I’d turn back time, but it seems I’m late  
A shiver runs through me, I hear your voice  
What is this, if not love?

**[Bridge]**  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard

**[Chorus]**  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard  
She’s not like the others  
No one’s like her  
She’s like a dream  
The girl from our yard
