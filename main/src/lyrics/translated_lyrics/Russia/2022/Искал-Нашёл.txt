**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
I searched for you, trusting in fate  
Following different paths, I sought you in dreams  
Wandering through the dark thickets of my days  
I walked towards the light that led me to you  
I searched for you in the struggle for each day  
Where the main enemy is my own shadow  
I found you in love and silence  
I walked towards the light that led me to you  

**[Verse 1]**  
Through mists and dawns  
Oceans, waves, winds  
Hundreds of thousands of kilometers  
To find answers with you  
It was no coincidence to meet you  
So that the sky would clear  
And children would laugh in the house  
Filling souls with light...  

**[Chorus]**  
I searched for you, trusting in fate  
Following different paths, I sought you in dreams  
Wandering through the dark thickets of my days  
I walked towards the light that led me to you  
I searched for you in the struggle for each day  
Where the main enemy is my own shadow  
I found you in love and silence  
I walked towards the light that led me to you...  

**[Verse 2]**  
On the way, I saw night, I saw day  
On the way, I saw everything, met many people  
On the way, I found and I lost  
My mistakes are my expendable material  
I stepped into the darkness to see  
I walked and knew I would be grateful for every mile  
For you, do you hear?!  
Your eyes were only a dream  
My quiet harbor, each day is a game of survival!  
I walked through both hatred and flattery  
While someone else got stuck in all of this –  
Didn’t pass the test  
For me, truth never lost its weight  
Let them forget about it, it still exists!  
There ahead is my home!  
And each of my days  
Leads me to it, as if a new step  
Yes, I feel the warmth of familiar walls  
Of that place where my heart won’t want to change...  

**[Chorus]**  
I searched for you, trusting in fate  
Following different paths, I sought you in dreams  
Wandering through the dark thickets of my days  
I walked towards the light that led me to you  
I searched for you in the struggle for each day  
Where the main enemy is my own shadow  
I found you in love and silence  
I walked towards the light that led me to you...  
I searched for you, trusting in fate  
Following different paths, I sought you in dreams  
Wandering through the dark thickets of my days  
I walked towards the light that led me to you  
I searched for you in the struggle for each day  
Where the main enemy is my own shadow  
I found you in love and silence  
I walked towards the light that led me to you...
