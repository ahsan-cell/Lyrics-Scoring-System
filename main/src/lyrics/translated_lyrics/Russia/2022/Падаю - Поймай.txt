**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
I’m falling — catch me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Fly with me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Everything that was - bye-bye, ta-ra-ra, hey  
For our meeting, I stepped beyond the edge  
And I’m falling — catch me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Fly with me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Everything that was - bye-bye, ta-ra-ra, hey  
A new day is before us, and in it, I see paradise  
O-o-a-a-a  

[Verse]  
Simply sweetly, boldly you sang with your body  
You stepped in, do-do the deed  
And I wrote your name in white chalk  
Against a concrete backdrop  
I’m coloring over the pain, you, not playing a role  
Knew my password, not knowing who I am  
And if in this world I meet you again  
Then it means, that night the Moon didn’t lie to me  
O-o-a-a-a  

[Bridge]  
Before me lies a path  
I walk it to you  
I’ll understand everything  
When I see your smile  
Ha-ha  

[Chorus]  
I’m falling — catch me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Fly with me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Everything that was - bye-bye, ta-ra-ra, hey  
For our meeting, I stepped beyond the edge  
And I’m falling — catch me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Fly with me, ta-ra-ra, hey  
Everything that was - bye-bye, ta-ra-ra, hey  
A new day is before us, and in it, I see paradise  
O-o-a-a-a
