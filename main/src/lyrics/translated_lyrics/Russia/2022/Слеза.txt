**Translated Lyrics:**

With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a tear will fall...  
This is Egor Kreed!

**[Verse 1]**  
I can smell your scent on my sweater  
I'll close my eyes with my hand, you're right in front of me again  
We said goodbye on the wrong note  
And once more, I’m heading home at dawn on autopilot  
Oh, damn!  
I’m changing hotels, these models in bed have bored me to death  
I’m lost again and writing once more, but I’ll erase the message  
And the feelings remain, but don’t pay them any mind  
Every time you’re with him, don’t think of me

**[Chorus]**  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
My best friend and my fiercest enemy  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a broken tear will fall  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
My best friend and my fiercest enemy  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a broken tear will fall

**[Verse 2]**  
Moments screamed feelings into my soul  
I won’t write my thoughts, doubts have silenced them  
I’ll drink love to the bottom, to intoxication  
Maybe it’s foolish, but I don’t care about their opinions  
Oh, damn!  
Stop it, I’m drawn again to what no longer attracts me  
The story of two crazies, who will tell them how to be?  
Feelings remain, but don’t pay them any mind  
Every time you’re with him, don’t think of me

**[Chorus]**  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
My best friend and my fiercest enemy  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a broken tear will fall  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
My best friend and my fiercest enemy  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a broken tear will fall

**[Bridge]**  
Did I imagine you for myself or did I create myself for you?  
I dreamed up that world where all quarrels are resolved with a kiss, not screams  
But no, I want to win so badly  
Your first move, place an X in the center  
And the end of the game is always a draw when we could just be together

**[Chorus]**  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
My best friend and my fiercest enemy  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a broken tear will fall  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
My best friend and my fiercest enemy  
With you, I can't, and without you, it's impossible  
And once again, a broken tear will fall
