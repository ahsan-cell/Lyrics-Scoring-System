**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Egor Kreed]**  
You’re off to work, I’m back on the road  
Friends tell me I’m a fool for falling for a bimbo  
I want to speak of the pain inside, but censorship won’t let me  
I laugh, like a chess player, with your figure in my head  
Feelings can’t be bought with cash  
Understand, men don’t care about the flash of your manicure  
What matters is what’s inside, even if your nature is so cool  
Love is absurd, from fights to sex with a smoke break  

**[Chorus: Egor Kreed & Nyusha]**  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone  

**[Verse 2: Nyusha & Egor Kreed]**  
You know, we always lived on different planets  
You always saw winter, while I saw summer  
And we fell asleep at dawn  
I didn’t know back then it was a cage  
So strong, so bold  
But what’s inside me, you never found out  
You never asked, but I forgave you  
I forgave you  

**[Chorus: Egor Kreed & Nyusha]**  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone  

**[Bridge: Nyusha & Egor Kreed]**  
I want to forget you so badly  
But the music will remind us  
A world where it’s just you and me  
A world where it’s just you and me  
How hard it is that you’re near  
We’re not the same anymore, but with the same gaze  
This truth cuts my heart  
How do I forget you?  

**[Chorus: Egor Kreed & Nyusha]**  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone (don’t pick up)  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings (you know)  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone (oh-oh)  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith  
But this isn’t love, so no hard feelings  
I’m heading home, don’t call for me  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone  

**[Outro: Nyusha]**  
You and I, like Mr. & Mrs. Smith, but  
If I ring you up — don’t pick up the phone
