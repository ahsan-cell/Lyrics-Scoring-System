**[Intro]**  
Heart Break Kid  

**[Chorus]**  
Baby, I'm in love  
I won't take your call  
You know I'm with someone else  
Just forget me and that's all  
Our time hasn't come  
Our time hasn't come  
Baby, I'm in love  
I won't take your call  
You know I'm with someone else  
Just forget me and that's all  
Our time hasn't come  
Our time hasn't come  

**[Verse 1]**  
So easy to say when you're not around  
So easy to stay silent when the look says it all  
Not easy to forgive when you break a vow  
We want to trust, but it's hard to tell where lies and truth fall (Yo)  
What punchlines? Relationships are never simple  
We're always on the path to where it's scary and sharp  
Our little island — our bed  
But again, another bed and again, not you, another silly hotel  

**[Bridge]**  
Forgive me, let go, and be happy with him  
But only my quiet home remembers love and your scent of perfume  

**[Chorus]**  
Baby, I'm in love  
I won't take your call  
You know I'm with someone else  
Just forget me and that's all  
Our time hasn't come  
Our time hasn't come  
Baby, I'm in love  
I won't take your call  
You know I'm with someone else  
Just forget me and that's all  
Our time hasn't come  
Our time hasn't come  

**[Verse 2]**  
Come on, let's submit and surrender (Yeah)  
Get angry, hold grudges (Yeah)  
Let go, so we can cling (Yeah)  
Allow mistakes, let jealousy be  
But don't compete  
If we gathered all the words about love from around the world, the story of you would be brief  
We're like Kanye and Kim. No, more like Jolie and Pitt  
You see me with someone else, I see you with another  
Lie and say it doesn't stir inside  
We're not Barbie and Ken (No)  
Though it'd be better if everything was decided for us, like in The Sims  
Want to go back to that day, feel it all?  
Just fall asleep — we'll find ourselves there  

**[Bridge]**  
Forgive me, let go, and be happy with him  
But only my quiet home remembers love and your scent of perfume  

**[Chorus]**  
Baby, I'm in love  
I won't take your call  
You know I'm with someone else  
Just forget me and that's all  
Our time hasn't come  
Our time hasn't come  
Baby, I'm in love  
I won't take your call  
You know I'm with someone else  
Just forget me and that's all  
Our time hasn't come  
Our time hasn't come (Time hasn't come)  

**[Outro]**  
Just answer me, what does it mean to love?  
What does love mean to you?  
After all, someone told me it doesn't exist, ha  
Well, we don't believe them, do we?
