**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Zivert]  
I am gone away  
I am gone away  
I am gone away  

[Verse 1: NILETTO]  
The best chill  
When everything around is silent  
Only music  
But it’s within us  
We’re like fireflies  
Lighting up the night  
An endless calm  
We have found  

[Bridge: NILETTO]  
Above the clouds, exhaling  
Our birds are fluttering  
Teach me their  
Love in offline  
Let’s count them  
There, you and I are missing  
Come close to me  
And fly away  

[Chorus: Zivert]  
I am gone away  
You’ll never wait  
For me to stay  
But as long as we have this day  
We can be brave  
And make it right  
I am gone away  
You’ll never wait  
For me to stay  
But as long as we have this day  
We can be brave  
And make it right  
Only fly  
Only fly  

[Transition: Zivert]  
We can build a wonder world  
Just follow me and dance all night  
'Cause nothing stops the music in your mind  
We can build a wonder world  
Just follow me and dance all night  
'Cause nothing stops the music in your mind  

[Verse 2: NILETTO]  
If this is a dream  
Then let it have it all  
Time like sand  
We catch happiness wherever we can  
Describe without words  
What this love is  
And beyond the horizon  
For the two of us  

[Bridge: NILETTO]  
Above the clouds, exhaling  
Our birds are fluttering  
Teach me their  
Love in offline  
Let’s count them  
There, you and I are missing  
Come close to me  
And fly away  

[Chorus: Zivert]  
I am gone away  
You’ll never wait  
For me to stay  
But as long as we have this day  
We can be brave  
And make it right  
I am gone away  
You’ll never wait  
For me to stay  
But as long as we have this day  
We can be brave  
And make it right  
Only fly  
Only fly  

[Outro: Zivert]  
We can build a wonder world  
Just follow me and dance all night  
'Cause nothing stops the music in your mind  
We can build a wonder world  
Just follow me and dance all night  
'Cause nothing stops the music in your mind
