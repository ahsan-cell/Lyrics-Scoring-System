**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Lil Fire]  
Look at how I walk, I've got the sauce  
Come to me, it's the best phase  
A girl calls me, come back down  
She's into Lil Fire  
Crazy Beat, damn

She knows I've got the sauce (Uh)  
I collect ice with my crew (Ice)  
Goal is the top and to stay there forever (Yeah)  
Talking bad about me, but who are you? (Oh)  
You don't even have respect, you're not in the gang (Gang, gang)  
Rolling in the neighborhood (Rá pá pá pow)  
I go to the studio, recording late (Yeah)  
What do you think? (Wow), today I'm here to make it count (Wow)  
If she wants Lil Fire, today she has to pay to see (Rá pá pá pá pow)  
Man, chill out (Wow), man, stay cool (Wow)  
If I pass by, you don't need to hide (Uh)

[Verse 2: Klyn]  
Klyn is the baddest in Recayd  
Oh no, I'm with Lil Fire (Pá pá pá)  
Envious ones will say it's fake (Pá pá pá pá)  
Oh no, we're saucy (Uh)  
Look at how we do trap (Uh)  
Gold digger wants my cash (Uh)  
Klyn's with Lil Fire, it's all swag (Uh)  
Tries to challenge but can't succeed (Uh)  
Got another hit, man, I didn't steal the flow  
Klyn's the baddest, crime spoke  
Made a hit with Lil Fire and the girls went wild  
Crazy sent the beat, we killed it here (Pá pá pá pá)

Look at how I walk, I've got the sauce (Gang, gang)  
Come to me (What, uh), it's the best phase (Yeah, yeah)  
A girl calls me, come back down (Come back down)  
She's into (She's into) Lil Fire (Uh)
