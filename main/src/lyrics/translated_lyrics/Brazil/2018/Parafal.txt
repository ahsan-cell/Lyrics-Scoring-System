**Translated Lyrics:**

**Chorus:**
Glock, Uzi, crazy with the arsenal  
Klyn holding down with the ParaFAL  
Nagalli said it’s all normal  
Just bandit stuff, today I’m feeling low  
Right, bitch?  
Glock, Uzi, crazy with the arsenal  
Klyn holding down with the ParaFAL  
Nagalli said it’s all normal  
Just bandit stuff, today I’m feeling low  

**Verse 1: Klyn**  
A damn bandit, I was destined to be  
I turned into a trapper, a slick bandit, seems like the same me  
From this wickedness, I came from the nest, where you kill to survive  
God’s in heaven, hand on the trigger, in this life, I won’t die  
Lost count of the girls calling me to hook up  
How many did I see in the mess that I had to hook up with?  
Trap is my life, I’m too much for your backyard and for you  
Today a bunch of wannabes, they want to be trapstars  
Some sing about being bandits, but being emotional is in style  
But if you step into Fontalis, you won’t last even two hours  
I’m the black guy they hate, but their daughter likes me  
Sounds a bit cliché, but for whites, black is trendy  
It’s normal for me to look in the mirror and say I’m dope  
It’s just that inevitably, I only drop fire lines  
I hook up with the white girl, and the black girl I take to Europe  
Trap is like my crime, I live off this and stack the cash (talk)  

**Bridge: Klyn**  
Living off this, stacking the cash  
I’m almost rich, a target for the cops  
I take the black girl to Europe, like the bandit she likes  

**Chorus: Dfideliz**  
Glock, Uzi, crazy with the arsenal  
Klyn holding down with the ParaFAL  
Nagalli said it’s all normal  
Just bandit stuff, today I’m feeling low  
Right, bitch?  
Glock, Uzi, crazy with the arsenal  
Klyn holding down with the ParaFAL  
Nagalli said it’s all normal  
Just bandit stuff, today I’m feeling low  

**Verse 2: Dfideliz**  
I’ve never seen anyone in the favela wanting my best  
If it were up to the boys, I’d be rich just selling drugs  
But I’m too black to wear the clothes you like  
I learned where I was born, if you can’t have it, we steal  
I’m torn between the favela and Morumbi  
That’s why I deal there, grab the money, and spend it here  
I used to be a kid, now I just think about sharing  
They wanted the toughest bandits, that’s why it’s me and Klyn  
I talk so much about Fontalis, you’ll never understand  
I live there and grew up there, and it’s there I’ll die  
You talk so much about being a bandit and fear dying  
If you lived where I live, the fear would be living, oh  

**Outro: Dfideliz**  
Today I’m rich  
I set the trends  
I’m more of a bandit  
A target for the cops  
In my hood  
Only cash flies  
Only bandits around  
I’m rolling deep
