Oh  

[Verse]  
On the corner of the hill, only armed thugs  
Here, it’s just hustlers making money from trafficking  
In the favela, the boss never showed mercy, the kids on watch were born ready  
Rich kids who use, they love their cocaine  
They know our crew is strong and we sell the best  
They come from Morumbi to spend their allowance here, but only one will rise, if they slip up, they’ll get hit without mercy  
It’s hard for us to feel pity, only for the worthless  
The girls climb the hill and shake it at the party  
If the cops get in the way, just say to send for backup  
They’ll have to deal with the kids ready to fight  
There are a lot of hustlers, I’m not too worried  
And when our crew passes by, just raise your rifles high  
Because down in Fontalis, we respect the residents  
And when it’s time to talk about pain, we see who’s by our side  
It’s tough to resist, only those who’ve suffered are here  
Today, I’m feeling heavy listening to the noise of...  
You can stay calm, I’m already becoming a king  
I’m tired of being seen as just another kid  
You can send for me, I’m in the same place  
You’ll see who’s there waiting for you  
But when you rise, be aware of the end, I can only give you one certainty: you’ll never come back  
A lot of drugs, a lot of cash  
There’s the white stuff, the green  
Look at the goods, send them over  
On the scale, a lot of lean  
We’re strong, we’re fierce  
A lot of rich, just for show  
In the package by my side  
Many girls in the Camaro  
I’ll never let a hustler silence my voice  
I’m living this intense life with this crazy girl  
I’m making money just selling this stuff  
And those who come looking only buy because we’re few  
A lot of hits, a lot of tracks  
A lot of sales for the kids  
They’re saying that trap  
Has a king, Dfideliz!
