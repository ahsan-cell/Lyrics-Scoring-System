**[Intro: Jé Santiago & Gshytt]**  
(Nagalli, he sent me the magic)  
Wow, yeah  
Yah, yah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Wow, wow, woah  
Wow, wow, woah  
Wow, wow, woah  
Woah, wow, woah  

**[Chorus: Jé Santiago]**  
Swag and rock n' roll (Roll)  
Inside this blunt is bold (Boldo)  
More than two thousand in my pocket  
You can keep my change, yah (Yah)  
Bitch sees and already says: "Wow" (Wow)  
They never understand the flow (Flow)  
But she wants to come to the show (Show)  
I’m always calm and cozy (Yeah)  
Man, I never lose my cool (Pose)  
Bih' on that Amber Rose vibe (Rose) (Bitch)  
Ice in my purple cup (Lean)  
Inside the package is coke (Coke)  
When I was a kid, my mom said  
To never settle for less (Less)  
That’s why I’m flexing the flow  
That’s why I hit the nitro and go (Yah, yah)  

**[Verse: Dfideliz]**  
Oh, they let me steal the scene (Woah, woah)  
Today I’m flying like a feather  
I’m making money even from those who hate me  
Dividing the pack like the Last Supper  
Many of them just want my cash (Skrrt)  
They know this won’t ever end (Yeah)  
But I’ll spend it on those who’ve been there for me  
Then I’ll see what to do with these bih'  
Oh, today I’m making it happen  
It’s that you forget the start of this mess (Pow, pow, pow)  
When you thought about stopping to do trap  
I was already hustling, selling word of mouth (Yeah)  
Oh, but for my kind, it’s harder  
Oh, if God had given me that privilege  
In less than a year, I’d be almost rich  
And my mom would surely have a roof (Yeah)  
But today I’m rich, gonna buy jewelry  
A new car, head to Miami (Pow, pow)  
Get a yacht, buy chains (Hey, hey)  
I’ll spend it all, gold teeth  
Call some bih's, throw a party  
Just with the gang, down in the hood (Skrrt)  
Pour whisky, bills up high  
Everything’s wet, no need to front (Woah, woah, woah)  

**[Chorus: Jé Santiago]**  
Swag and rock n' roll (Roll)  
Inside this blunt is bold (Boldo)  
More than two thousand in my pocket  
You can keep my change, yah (Yah)  
Bitch sees and already says: "Wow" (Wow)  
They never understand the flow (Flow)  
But she wants to come to the show (Show)  
I’m always calm and cozy (Yeah)  
Man, I never lose my cool (Pose)  
Bih' on that Amber Rose vibe (Rose) (Bitch)

That’s why I hit the nitro and go (Yah, yah)
