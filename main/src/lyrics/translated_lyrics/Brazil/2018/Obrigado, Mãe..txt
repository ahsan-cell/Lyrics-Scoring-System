**[Intro]**  
Nana, nanananana  
Nana, nana, nanananana  
Nana, nana, nanananana  
Nana, hey  
Nagalli, he sent me the magic  
Yeah, eh  

**[Chorus]**  
It's been a while since this outlaw life has been bringing me some cash  
A black man with a piece on his waist makes it easier to clash  
You've been here from the start, I became a king and I'm not at the end  
Just keep shaking that thing while I can mix up a gin  
It's been a while since this outlaw life has been bringing me some cash  
A black man with a piece on his waist makes it easier to clash  
You've been here from the start, I became a king and I'm not at the end  
Just keep shaking that thing while I can mix up a gin  

**[Verse]**  
I really saw everything my mother went through  
And I realized that I truly am no one  
I suffered, but this shit that once saved me  
That's when I decided I’d die for someone  
"I slept worried, son, you’re black  
The world out there will want to hit you  
But you’re not to blame, yet you’ll be a suspect  
Make sure this shit only helps you grow" (Yeah, eh)  
I went to ask for contact, I swear, I didn’t know what I’d do  
But I was armed, just wanted a step  
Or some reason to get myself screwed  
My life felt like a graffiti of rhythm  
They criticize me for anything I do  
I’d rather have a Glock than a hug  
Try to challenge me and see if I won’t take you down (Yeah, eh)  

**[Chorus]**  
It's been a while since this outlaw life has been bringing me some cash  
A black man with a piece on his waist makes it easier to clash  
You've been here from the start, I became a king and I'm not at the end  
Just keep shaking that thing while I can mix up a gin  
It's been a while since this outlaw life has been bringing me some cash  
A black man with a piece on his waist makes it easier to clash  
You've been here from the start, I became a king and I'm not at the end  
Just keep shaking that thing while I can mix up a gin
