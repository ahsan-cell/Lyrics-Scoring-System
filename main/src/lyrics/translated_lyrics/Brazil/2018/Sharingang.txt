**[Verse 1]**  
I came back stronger than you can imagine, Shinra Tensei!  
Devastating your village, man, you see I win the race  
You know, Urassam, I’m the bullet train of the village  
Man, I jump, teleport, new girl wants to hang, asks for a passport  
I’ve got the Rinnegan, piercing through the lens  
My cloak was torn in the fight  
Pass me my Beretta, Urassam Halley the comet  
As you pass by, you comment, say my crew’s a bother, ha  
Everyone in black like a funeral, red cloud, I’m the immortal one  
The fifth gate has been opened, tried to break my heart for real  
Hidan's secret jutsu, Kakuzu had 5, now 4  
Get out of the way, I make the seal, hit them, your worst nightmare  
Don’t stop me, I’m without brakes, Massaru tamed you like a rodeo  
With paper bombs, she wants the renegade  
Kunai in the clip, I don’t hesitate at all  
Dreher in the ramen, I’m alpha, you’re just cattle, you can say I’m better for real  

**[Chorus]**  
Rank-S, I won, Sharingan on Kanye  
Cut them all down, flow katana like the front line  
Rank-S, I won, Sharingan on Kanye  
Cut them all down, flow katana like the front line  

**[Verse 2]**  
Laminated at the waist, break key, the cloak doesn’t matter to me  
It’s a fact I know, when I speak, she gets wet  
Tells me it was good and that we had fun  
The girls love it and the playboys melt  
They’re cowards, I’m the villain to the kids  
Village of mist, it rains knives  
Trap is in the streets, you don’t leave the net  
Steel chest, we’ll pierce you  
Bullet in the skull, lodged in the nape  
It’s a fact I know, when I speak, you listen  
Says it was bad because you’re demented  
Urassam, face them head-on  
We’re a thousand degrees on the hot scale  
Windows freeze, I’m Bill Gates  
Babe, swag, tight pants  
Like my favorite dish, cooked just right, al dente  

**[Chorus]**  
Rank-S, I won, Sharingan on Kanye  
Cut them all down, flow katana like the front line  
Rank-S, I won, Sharingan on Kanye  
Cut them all down, flow katana like the front line  
Rank-S, I won, Sharingan on Kanye  
Cut them all down, flow katana like the front line  
Rank-S, I won, Sharingan on Kanye  
Cut them all down, flow katana like the front line
