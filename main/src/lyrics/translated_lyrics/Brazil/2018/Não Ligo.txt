**Translated Lyrics:**

I don’t care about anything, I don’t run from anything  
They run from everything, they’re afraid of everything  
They want to know everything, but they say nothing  
When they see the cops, they run back home  
I don’t care about anything, I don’t run from anything  
They run from everything, they’re afraid of everything  
They want to know everything, but they say nothing  
When they see the cops, they run back home  

**[Bridge]**  
Because they’re envious of our nation  
The day goes by and they’ll be left behind  
Because they’re envious of our nation  
The day goes by and they’ll be left behind  

**[Verse 1]**  
And they won’t find me  
My brother, I’m going to tell you  
That no one will touch me  
I’m making things happen  
I’m claiming my place  
But you’ll never understand  
That now I’m going to shine  
And your eyes will burn  

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t care about anything, I don’t run from anything  
They run from everything, they’re afraid of everything  
They want to know everything, but they say nothing  
When they see the cops, they run back home  

**[Bridge 2]**  
Because they’re envious of our nation  
The day goes by and they’ll be left behind  
Because they’re envious of our nation  
The day goes by and they’ll be left behind  

**[Verse 2]**  
And they won’t find me  
My brother, I’m going to tell you  
That no one will touch me  
I’m making things happen  
I’m claiming my place  
But you’ll never understand  
That now I’m going to shine  
And your eyes will burn  

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t care about anything, I don’t run from anything  
They run from everything, they’re afraid of everything  
They want to know everything, but they say nothing  
When they see the cops, they run back home  
I don’t care about anything, I don’t run from anything  
They run from everything, they’re afraid of everything  
They want to know everything, but they say nothing  
When they see the cops, they run back home
