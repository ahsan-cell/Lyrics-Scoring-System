**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Igu & MC Bin Laden]  
It's Igu  
Look at the tuim, look at the tuim  
Uh, yeah  

[Chorus: MC Igu]  
Throw your thin mustache (Thin), toss the money at her (At her)  
Pour champagne in the Jacuzzi (Ayy), bitch, I'm with Red Bull  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (Oh)  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (Juju, hey)  
Throw your thin mustache (Thin), toss the money at her (At her)  
Pour champagne in the Jacuzzi (Uh), bitch, I'm with Red Bull  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (On point)  
Hair on point (Hey), Juju's magnifying glass (It's G)  

[Verse 1: MC Igu]  
I'm with whisky and Red Bull (Uh), fill the cup and down one (Uh)  
Rare mustache shifu (Huh), she's inside my Cruze  
Inside it, we cross paths, unbuckle the medusa  
She wants to play peekaboo (Bih'), yellow gold like Pikachu (It's G)  
Kit in the law room, she’s coming down like a pro  
Igu, you know I'm king, speaks little and hits play  
I want to go to Italy with my bae  
Haters just think we're feeling sorry, man, you know we’re not alone  
You doubted the talent, stumbled, look at my team Recayd Mob  
Lean, lean, look at the Mitsubishi, it's full of lean  
You went quiet, seems like you're Bean, now you're in doubt, want my cash (Cash)  
Vish, I'm paying in dollars via Paypal, bih', they talk fast like Jet Li  
Taking the bitch to Italy on my jet ski, I’m already wanting to call the bad bitch (Hey)  

[Bridge: MC Igu]  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (Juju)  
Fill her cup only with whisky and Red Bull (Red Bull)  
She’s already seen me on the CB1000  
On my feet Balenciaga, she likes it subtle (It's G)  

[Chorus: MC Igu]  
Throw your thin mustache (Thin), toss the money at her (At her)  
Pour champagne in the Jacuzzi (Hey), bitch, I'm with Red Bull  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (Oh)  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (Juju, hey)  
Throw your thin mustache (Thin), toss the money at her (At her)  
Pour champagne in the Jacuzzi (Uh), bitch, I'm with Red Bull  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (On point)  
Hair on point (Hey), Juju's magnifying glass (It's G)  

[Verse 2: MC PH]  
It's the 4M, only victory, for my team much glory (Much glory)  
We live what we say, you all are just history (No)  
Sitting in a chair made of money, I see the sea  
Thirty sexy girls and 100g to relax  
So okay, call my bro 24k  
'Cause I have products to order  
Bring Prada, some frozen mud, go there 'cause they want to fly  
Send to fetch (Ah), feel free to talk, from up high I (Bleh) won't hear you  
I only hear them screaming my name and calling on my iPhone non-stop  
I only know how to profit, only know how to profit  
Doesn't matter the time or place  
New rich, gang of millionaires  
Who tries against us but won’t come back  
Crew of blue bills (Uh)  
On the yacht smoking chocolate, coconut ice and in the cup a blue (Blue), blue  
Several Royal Salute, annihilating the girls of Majin Boo color, call me Goku (Uh)  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  

[Chorus: MC Igu & MC PH]  
Throw your thin mustache (Thin), toss the money at her (At her)  
Pour champagne in the Jacuzzi, bitch, I'm with Red Bull  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass (Juju, hey)  
Throw your thin mustache, toss the money at her  
Pour champagne in the Jacuzzi, bitch, I'm with Red Bull  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass  
Hair on point, Juju's magnifying glass, Juju (Hey, yeah)  

[Outro: MC PH]  
Oh, Igu and PH  
Yeah, yeah, yeah
