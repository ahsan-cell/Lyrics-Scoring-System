**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Dfideliz & Gshytt]  
Nagalli, he sent me the magic  
Woah  

[Verse: Dfideliz]  
Oh, but today no one’s rising, they’ve hit the radio (Pow, pow)  
Later there’s a party, only with rifles held high  
Pour some whiskey for my bandit friends  
And some girls in bikinis who get wet with the hustle  
The girls love the faction parties  
They love to shake it on a thief's rifle  
Today the lookout boys will also be armed (Yeah)  
And the kids who are firecrackers will hook up with a big gun  
I came from a favela where it was never easy  
All my friends who lived in shacks  
Most are dead, I’m living for them  
Just protect me, the rest I’ll handle  
Mom, now they’re calling me king (Ahn)  
Remember when I was nobody?  
I’ll get you a whole white house in Dubai  
And I swear I’ll never look down on anyone  
In this criminal life, I learned not to have pity (Yeah)  
I’ve been living this since I was young  
Today the kids who ran with me  
Have to cope with seeing their mom high on powder  
Seriously, do you think my life is easy? (Yeah)  
Try just one day living by my side (Yeah)  
I want to see if you can bear the weight of my skin color (Arghh)  
If you’ll keep saying I’m faking, yeah  

[Pre-Chorus: Dfideliz]  
Cocaine, molly (Molly), flexin' (Flexin'), argh (Argh)  
Purple (Purple), bitches (Bitches), ice (Ice), skrrt (Skrrt)  
Cocaine (Cocaine), molly (Molly), flexin' (Flexin'), argh (Argh)  
Purple (Purple), bitches (Bitches), ice (Ice), skrrt (Skrrt)  

[Chorus: Dfideliz & Kiaz]  
Yeah, woah, rich black man again  
And I make money, how I make money, woman comes with cash in my pocket, yeah  
Yeah, I’m back in the game  
Ask who became king and they mentioned Dfideliz again, yeah  
Yeah, woah, rich black man again  
And I make money, how I make money, woman comes with cash in my pocket, yeah  
Woah, I’m back in the game  
Ask who became king, they mentioned Dfideliz again, yeah
