**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Derek]  
Drop it on the Spike beat

[Chorus: JÉ]  
Everything expensive in this place (Yah)  
She wants the purple and the green (Yah)  
I have some white and some pink (Pink)  
You can mix it with my lean  
'Cause she wants more (More)  
Drop it on the Spike beat (Yah)  
Bitch wants to kill my vibe (Uh)  
I make money like Eike* (Yah)  
Audi on the street goes vroom, vroom  
The hood's looking like Dubai (Dubai)  
She saw me and zoomed in (Zoom, zoom)  
Posted it 'cause I'm hype (Yah, yah)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa (Whoa)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa (Whoa)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa (Whoa)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa

[Post-Chorus: Derek]  
It was plaqtudum, plaqtudum  
Plaqtu-plaqtu-plaqtudum  
It was plaqtudum, plaqtudum  
Plaqtu-plaqtu-plaqtudum  

[Verse 1: Derek]  
She's sucking it all, sucking it all  
Sucking, sucking, sucking, she's sucking it all  
Go ahead, do whatever, you can do anything  
You're smoking pressed weed, you bum  
Had an after-party at my place, only wild ones showed up  
Soon I grabbed some drugs for us to get high  
But don’t say a word, just come closer  
And Leozin from 27 is already dropping the real talk  
It was plaqtudum, wild and raw  
Young girl riding the wave of 7Belo*  
While the homies are smoking, everything’s cool  
If she’s down, she’ll have to ride the pole  
The boys are thugs, come here  
I like the girls from the hood and I hate Morumbi*  
If we’re sharing, you better listen  
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck the police, huh  

[Bridge: Derek]  
And she likes loló*  
She’s really high on powder  
Brings her friends for the fun  
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa  

[Verse 2: Dfideliz]  
They told me my flow is always the same  
That I lack talent, that they feel sorry, oh  
But if you look at who criticizes me  
When it comes to rhymes, I want to see one better, oh  
You don’t confront because you know you can’t handle it  
A bum stands tall and has to see me at my worst, oh (Uh)  
And the money I make these days  
The kids in the slums are turning it into powder, oh  
Oh, if I catch you  
I want to see if you really get into this game  
Remember that fool who only talked about crime? He got shot just to be an example in the hood (Pow, pow)  
Just be aware, don’t slip in the favela  
If you want to roll with us, then you better not show weakness (Uh)  
I’m focused only on my money, your opinion better be right  
I never spill ugliness in my words, ha, ha  

[Bridge: Dfideliz & Derek]  
Whoa-whoa, whoa  
Whoa-whoa, whoa  
Whoa-whoa, whoa  
Whoa-whoa  
Drop it on the Spike beat  

[Chorus: JÉ]  
Everything expensive in this place (Yah)  
She wants the purple and the green (Yah)  
I have some white and some pink (Pink)  
You can mix it with my lean  
'Cause she wants more (More)  
Drop it on the Spike beat (Yah)  
Bitch wants to kill my vibe (Uh)  
I make money like Eike (Yah)  
Audi on the street goes vroom, vroom  
The hood's looking like Dubai (Dubai)  
She saw me and zoomed in (Zoom, zoom)  
Posted it 'cause I'm hype (Yah, yah)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa (Whoa)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa (Whoa)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa (Whoa)  
Whoa-whoa, whoa  

[Post-Chorus: Derek]  
It was plaqtudum, plaqtudum  
Plaqtu-plaqtu-plaqtudum  
It was plaqtudum, plaqtudum  
Plaqtu-plaqtu-plaqtudum
