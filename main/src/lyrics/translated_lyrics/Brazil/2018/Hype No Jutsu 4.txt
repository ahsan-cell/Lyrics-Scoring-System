**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Luckhaos]**  
You think you're tough, but to me, you're just Deidara (You're Deidara)  
Talk a lot, but face to face, you do nothing (Face to face, you do nothing)  
Save that clay flow, 'cause this ain't art (This ain't art)  
My flow's Kusanagi, making hits is just part of it (Making hits is just part of it)  
I get mad at these kids talking about my life (What?)  
Claiming they're from the Akatsuki, but they don't show up in the village (Okay, okay)  
You think you're a Renegade (Yeah) just 'cause you're unknown? (Okay)  
Stop being foolish (What?), nobody likes to hear trash, damn!  
Let me speak, I put pressure in the air, supersonic like Zaku (Okay)  
Not even carrying Kekkei Genkai, but my flow pierced you like Haku (Okay)  
Hype no Jutsu, that's a fact, yeah, yeah, a fact  
I know you talk behind my back, but in front of me, you stay quiet  
Come to play, I already know, I caught you  
Frozen in my genjutsu and I'm not even a sensei  
Come to play, I already know, I caught you  
I'll use my Jinton, you're a regular  
I remember when no one cared, posting my sound just to let it out  
Things got good, now it's turning, a bunch of jealous folks popped up complaining  
Wanna talk about me? Do better than I do, I'm already like Naruto Sennin, you're a peasant  
I don’t throw shade, I punch in the neck, just hand signals for these sons of bitches (Okay)  

**[Verse 2: Massaru]**  
Get out of here, boy, we’re winged outlaws  
Bijuu of the village, keeping the legacy alive  
Urassam and Luck Lee, Hype no Jutsu 4!  
Massaru Edo Tensei, you never tire of losing to us  
Stuck in yesterday's Izanami, I'm faster with nunchucks  
You know I cut, don’t even look at your face, just a punch to the chest  
Face it, my team is strong, chrome on the belt, I’m just that way  
I stuck everyone with the hit, didn’t even use the seal, Kung Fusion style, I’m quick  
Torn cloak, I’m not the same anymore, pay for my work or there won’t be a concept  
Flipped 10 cards against them, they’re Hentai  
EF hits the beat, it’s Maito Guy  
They’re Pink Floyd, we’re Foo Fighters, your girl tasted and asked for more  
Heard my voice on the call and quit the game, stop  
Stop, my crew is strong, the boys and the cash, the job never ends  
I arrived as an escort in the village, let’s hit the drive-thru, lose in the race, super machine that never falters  
Look at my mark, curse spreads, you use hacks and in the pot, crack  
Urassam, athlete of the century, I’ll take you down after the pendulum  
Like ahead of time, I’m always there  
You’ll never catch me, it’s 'cause I run too fast  
And Bolt was just a kid  
Son of a bitch, slow down the horse in the rain  
I’ll never give props to a talentless kid  
Who grows at the expense of their father.
