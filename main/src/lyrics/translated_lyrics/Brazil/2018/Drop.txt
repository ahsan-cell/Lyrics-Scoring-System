**[Intro]**  
I'm flying (Oh-oh-oh)  
Dude, look at what I'm achieving (Yeah)  
I'm flying (Oh-oh-oh)  
Caio Passos and WEY on the beat (Oh-oh-oh)  

**[Chorus]**  
Thirty thousand on me, pouring in the lean (Pour it!)  
Everything here, I'm pissing Hennessy (Alright!)  
What I wrote made me rich, you see (It's lit!)  
Driving a thousand, fast like Sonic (Sonic!)  

**[Verse 1]**  
Making bombs  
I run the scene  
I'm in the car with my girl  
Your radar can't keep up (Goddamn!)  
Buying another quad bike  
Heard my sound and then he sucked me off  
I know you criticized  
But I'm making money from shows  

**[Bridge 1]**  
I have fame, luxury (Yeah)  
Always in the flow  
Filling up the club (Aye)  
Drugs on the yacht (Yacht)  
Catch the vibe  
Catch the vibe (Skrtt-skrtt)  

**[Verse 2]**  
My money, stacking cash in my Mercedes (Ya-ya!)  
My verse hits like a rifle, piercing your vest (Yessir!)  
You got interested 'cause you saw the Fendi pulse (Pew-pew)  
Wild choppa, that's why when you see me, you tremble  

**[Bridge 2]**  
I'm flying  
Dude, look at what I'm achieving (Yeah)  
I'm flying  

**[Verse 3]**  
Strengthening my team, making millions  
I'm flying in a jet with the crew armed  
Don't mess with my gang, I'm doing in one day  
What you can't achieve in a season  
Surfing the hype, getting down with the scene  
They doubted me, and I'm killing hyenas  
I hear your sound and I even feel sorry  
You claim to be so big with such small rhymes  
Oh shit, let me do it  
Throw the carats and several top-tier  
Drop my sound in your depression  
This is my talent, my babe  
What a drag, this Cîroc  
Punchy rhymes, leave you dazed  
And for me to get tired of Porsche  
I had focus, it was never luck  

**[Chorus]**  
Thirty thousand on me, pouring in the lean (Pour it!)  
Everything here, I'm pissing Hennessy (Alright!)  
What I wrote made me rich, you see (It's lit!)  
Driving a thousand, fast like Sonic  
Thirty thousand on me, pouring in the lean (Pour it!)  
Everything here, I'm pissing Hennessy (Alright!)  
What I wrote made me rich, you see (It’s lit!)  
Driving a thousand, fast like Sonic-c-c-c  

**[Outro]**  
Caio Passos and WEY on the beat
