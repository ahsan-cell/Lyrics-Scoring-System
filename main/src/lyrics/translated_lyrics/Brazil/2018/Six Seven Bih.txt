**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Derek]  
Okay, okay  
Yoah, yoah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Okay, okay  
Six seven girl on my telephone  
Dropping on the beat from Spike!

[Chorus: Derek]  
She’s on the runway, wearing VLONE pants  
Six seven girl on my telephone  
Stu', trap house, White Horse, girl  
In this gangster life, I’m putting on a show  
She’s on the runway, wearing VLONE pants  
Six seven girl on my telephone  
Stu', trap house, White Horse, girl  
In this gangster life, I’m putting on a show

[Post-Chorus: Derek]  
Okay, okay  
Yeah, okay, okay  
Okay, okay  
Yeah, okay, okay  

[Verse 1: Dfideliz]  
Can you bring me a whiskey, a cigarette, and a girl, oh  
Bring a double cup, ice in the promethazine, uh  
Keep my Mercedes safe, I’m here for anything  
Alright, today I want to chill, I’m smooth with this lean  
The boys from J already hit the radio  
Today everything’s flowing, just orders by the kilo  
Oh doctor, I’m a thug, okay? It doesn’t even make sense, oh  
The hood is leisure, a while without any shots  
Stay calm  
Just shake that body while I pour you some lean, yeah  
I love this girl  
Move slowly so I can feel it nice and smooth

[Verse 2: Raffa Moreira]  
Six thirty at Spike (Yeah)  
Derek, check the mic (Ayy)  
Girl on my WhatsApp (Ayy)  
Slippers, Prada socks (Yeah, yeah)  
Jet night in São Paulo (Arghh)  
Jordan, Versace shorts (Uh)  
My boo asked for a blowjob (Ayy, yeah)  
Every day a new woman (Uh-huh)  
I’m going to live it all at once (Skrtt, skrtt, uh, uh, ayy, yeah)  
Drugs, new clothes, two girls on Tuesday (Ayy)  
This is just the start of the month (Yeah, uh-huh)  
Rockstar, ripped jeans, living like this forever (Uh-huh, yeah)

[Verse 3: Klyn]  
She wants my lean, just ask and I’ll fill the cup  
You’re jealous of me, I’ve become a highlight, I’m on the podium  
A black guy full of swagger because today I have and can  
My lifestyle is a raffle, I don’t sell or trade  
I’m in that vibe, hit  
Vibe that doesn’t resist, lit  
I declined an invite, feat  
10k in my account, girl  
They talk a lot, pretend  
Recayd on top, wow  
I’m better than before, vibe  
Klyn is the best, click  
Today I’m earning so tomorrow I can relax  
I made a flow just to see the girl shake it  
Today everything’s good, only good stuff to burn  
Look where I am, you all will have to respect

[Pre-Chorus: Derek]  
Yeah, okay, okay  
Yeah, okay, okay  
Yeah, okay, okay  
Yeah, okay, okay  
Six seven girl on my telephone

[Chorus: Derek]  
She’s on the runway, wearing VLONE pants  
Six seven girl on my telephone  
Stu', trap house, White Horse, girl  
In this gangster life, I’m putting on a show  
She’s on the runway, wearing VLONE pants  
Six seven girl on my telephone  
Stu', trap house, White Horse, girl  
In this gangster life, I’m putting on a show  

[Outro: Raffa Moreira]  
I’m going to live it all at once  
Drugs, new clothes, two girls on Tuesday  
This is just the start of the month  
Rockstar, ripped jeans, living like this forever
