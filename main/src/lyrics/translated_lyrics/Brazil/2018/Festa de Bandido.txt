**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Gshytt]  
Nagalli, he sent me the magic

[Chorus]  
Bandit party, no girl can resist, yeah  
Rifle held high, half and Puma Disk, yeah  
Only cloned cards, we spend it all in style, yeah  
Booty shaking, blunt and hashish, yeah  
Bandit party, no girl can resist, yeah  
Rifle held high, half and Puma Disk, yeah  
Only cloned cards, we spend it all in style, yeah  
Booty shaking, blunt and hashish, yeah  

[Verse]  
It was never easy for us, but I'm making it happen  
They disrespected us so much, I want to see you endure  
I’ll gather the brothers from the hood to plan it all  
Get rich as hell without just dealing drugs  
Out on the street there's a bank, but see what’s the deal  
Pass the radin' to them, say it's corner goods  
Gather a crew from Fon, lots of whiskey and many girls  
Then we get ready and meet at the border  
Today, if you think it’s easy being black and from the favela  
You have to prove what we have by taking hits from the cops  
Things are good  
And I’m rich, bought it all on my own  
My son is growing up strong and beautiful, my mom's out of rent  
I’m gonna make a lot of money, just to make you doubt  
Thinking every black person comes from the hood to steal  
Do it like this, stay sharp, a bandit can't mess up  
You want a clip, we got it, you want a shot, you’ll take it  
Pow pow pow, the beat is from Nagalli, right?  
It makes it even easier, right? This is for the bandits, right?  
I’m back again  
Came out of the struggle to buy a new car  

[Outro]  
The beat is from Nagalli, right?  
It makes it even easier, right? This is for the bandits, right?
