**Translated Lyrics:**

Dan, dan-ran, ahn  
Dan-ran, ahn, dan-ran  
Nagalli he sent me the magic  

**[Chorus]**  
So much money, it barely fits in my pocket  
My neck's loaded with gold, wow  
Shit, I'm hyped, feeling good, yeah  
Bitch, call me the boss  
So much money, it barely fits in my pocket  
My neck's loaded with gold, wow  
Shit, I'm hyped, feeling good, yeah  
Bitch, call me the boss  
So much money, it barely fits in my pocket  
My neck's loaded with gold, wow  
Shit, I'm hyped, feeling good, yeah  
Bitch, call me the boss  
So much money, it barely fits in my pocket  
My neck's loaded with gold, wow  
Shit, I'm hyped, feeling good, yeah  
Bitch, call me the boss  

**[Verse]**  
I'm hyped, I'm on fire, I'm fashionable, I'm high, I'm trending, I'm favored  
I'm coming up, rising, to be rich, richer than rich, like a flashy king  
I buy everything in double, it's all paid  
More expensive, just how I like it and I spend  
Earning, spending, flaunting money  
Burning it and throwing it up high  
Girl with a big butt wanting to party in my bed  
I said I won't even go to my room now  
They want a party without pajamas  
I spilled codeine on my jeans  
A bitch wants lean, cleaning with her mouth  
Cocaine with molly, framed from here, the cash that drives them crazy  
So much cash, gold, and faith  
It's the way I want it  
I have everything she wants  
I am what they want to be  
So much cash, gold, and faith  
It's the way I want it  
I have everything she wants  
I am what they want to be  

**[Chorus]**  
So much money, it barely fits in my pocket  
My neck's loaded with gold, wow  
Shit, I'm hyped, feeling good, yeah  
Bitch, call me the boss  
So much money, it barely fits in my pocket  
My neck's loaded with gold, wow  
Shit, I'm hyped, feeling good, yeah  
Bitch, call me the boss
