**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Celo, you’re amazing  
Uh (Uh)  

[Chorus]  
This she never asks of you  
This she never asks of you (This she never asks of you)  
It’s because she’s finesse  
It’s because she’s finesse (It’s because she’s finesse)  
It’s because she’s finesse and decides for herself (Oh, yeah)  
It’s because she’s finesse and doesn’t chat with just anyone (Oh, yeah)  

[Post-Chorus]  
She has a different touch for me  
I see that girl from afar (Far)  
She rides the wave of promethazine (Yeah)  
She already knows who Igu is, girl, sit down, oh, yeah  

[Verse]  
This girl is finesse (Yeah)  
She’s everything you want (Yeah)  
Girl, get off my back (Yeah!)  
Make sure you’re not in the bag (Bag)  
Ride the wave of lean (Lean!)  
Baby, I know you want it  
Your kitty comes as a bonus  
She wants fish in the bag (Ih!)  
Uh, I know you like it this way (This way)  
Never touch my girl (Yeah)  
Not even on the Jordan OG (G!)  
She’s really into it, wanting to roll in this Benz (Bang!)  
She’s really into it, she only comes with me (Brr!)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, okay, you’ve got it all (Okay)  
Baby, okay, I’ll give you everything (Okay)  
Baby, okay, grab it all (Babe)  
My baby, okay, grab it all (Babe)  

[Chorus]  
This she never asks of you  
This she never asks of you (This she never asks of you)  
It’s because she’s finesse  
It’s because she’s finesse (It’s because she’s finesse)  
It’s because she’s finesse, decides for herself (Oh, yeah)  
It’s because she’s finesse, doesn’t chat with just anyone (Oh, yeah)  

[Post-Chorus]  
She has a different touch for me  
I see that girl from afar (Far)  
She rides the wave of promethazine (Yeah)  
She already knows who Igu is, girl, sit down, oh, yeah  

[Outro: Lady Gaga]  
Just j-j-just dance
