**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Derek]  
Hey  
Talk, talk, talk, talk  
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey  
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey  
This one is something special, huh...

[Chorus: BONE]  
I bring these drugs in the Colt  
There's bullets, and there's lean, and there's candy  
I bring these drugs in the Colt  
There's bullets, and there's lean, and there's candy  
I'm in Dior, whoa, whoa  
I've got my Glock, glock, glock  
I'm in Dior, whoa, whoa  
I've got my Glock, glock, glock  
I bring these drugs in the Colt  
There's bullets, and there's lean, and there's candy  
I bring these drugs in the Colt  
There's bullets, and there's lean, and there's candy  
I'm in Dior, whoa, whoa  
I've got my Glock, glock, glock  
I'm in Dior, whoa, whoa  
I've got my Glock, glock, glock  

[Verse 1: Derek]  
When you think, it's already gone (Already gone)  
Come closer, five more, there's two (What?)  
I make my moves later (Later)  
There's green and purple bullets (Woah)  
Gucci, Prada, Gosha, Gosha (Yeah)  
My vibe is already lit (Yeah)  
Good vibes, good vibes, yeah (Uh)  
Good drugs, good drugs, yeah (What?)  
And today it's just my vibe (Yeah)  
I record there at Spike (Yeah)  
I know she's coming (Shh, shh, shh)  
And she asks for more (Yeah)  
Today I’m heavy with the gang (Gang)  
Recayd already rolls with the gang (Gang)  
Wack rhymes don’t exist  
You think we are who? (Yeah)  
Rare rhymes, rare rhymes  
I do this so easily (Yeah)  
Good drugs, fine drugs, what?  
That even tires me out (Yeah)  
I’m with a Glock, I’m with an Uzi (Uh, yeah)  
Pouring whiskey in the pool (Ayy, yeah)  
Smoking drugs in the Jacuzzi (Skrrt, skrrt, wow)  
Throwing it to the girls  

[Verse 2: Dfideliz]  
Oh, a lot of thugs in the room  
Just don’t spill the beans, or it’ll get messy  
Put away my Uzi, let’s go to the Jacuzzi  
Get that body ready, I’m about to spank  
Oh, call the naughty friends  
Because the boys are all loaded  
Call Calvin, he’s back from the trip  
Ask for my luggage, it’s just rare drugs  
Oh, a booty that rises and doesn’t stop  
A booty that drops and bounces and doesn’t stop  
Turn around, arch it, sexy  
I’m gonna spank to leave my mark  
Oh, call the boys from the crew  
Tell Klyn there’s lean in stock  
After the show, we’re heading to the hotel  
And only the girls who get down come with us  
Ed calling, hit the radio  
Because the promoter already sent the cash  
One’s giving me head, the other counting  
While you’re making my dreads thin  
This thug life that never ends  
This damn life that never ends  
I’ve seen my death, that messes with me  
For your sadness, it takes a while  

[Verse 3: MC Igu]  
Got Juliet, Romeo 2, and Double Shox  
18K on my neck, in Ecko and Nike Shox  
The kids are already hunting, with the .40 Glock  
20K in my suitcase, plus a kit for us to close  
I do what I want, bought Juliet  
She wants jewels while giving head  
I send the package, there’s more kilos  
She bounces her butt saying she’s coming down  
Never touch my Glock (Yeah)  
Romeo 2 and Double Shox (Skrrt)  
From Maricota to Santa Cecília  
160 fleeing from the cops (Ahn, ahn, ahn)  
Accelerate hard, the bags in the tank  
And the rifle on the back  
Driving with one hand and shooting with the other  
Specialist in escape (Skrrt)  
Accelerate hard, the bags in the tank (Yeah)  
And the rifle on the back  
Driving with one hand and shooting with the other  
Specialist in escape (Yeah)  

[Bridge]  
Hi  
Oh  

[Verse 4: JÉ]  
Shorts, shirt, with "O" printed  
In my socks, titanium, on my feet, Flack Jack  
Gascan cap, on my wrist Blade 2
