**[Verse 1]**  
Massaru  
Massaru once again  
Causing waves in the trap, collecting fans  
Master move, I know, I know  
I don’t struggle for rhymes, how about you?  
I talk, talk, talk about anime when I want  
If I want to mention Bleach, I’ll do it because I can  
If I want to name my girl, ninja, not a number  
Cooking up hype, my account’s rising from zero  
Left behind on the ground those who thought they had talent  
Now I show you, rare skill only in a sound  
And if they talk bad, it’s a sign that we’re good  
Because if we were nothing, no one would say a word, no  
I’m very Shikamaru, just possessing minds  
I’m Lee without weights, fast as a snake  
You’re like Gaara, only confident in the sand  
Your trap makes me feel sorry, I’ll donate some lines  
Massaru once again  

**[Chorus]**  
I keep devastating the scene  
My hits that provoke and you all revere  
No one can stop me, I’m the bullet train of the village  
Advanced shinobi a thousand years ahead of the land  
Ah, I keep devastating the scene  
My hits that provoke and you all revere  
No one can stop me, I’m the bullet train of the village  
Advanced shinobi a thousand years ahead of the land  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’re nodding your head listening to Shuriken  
Your girl in the DMs wanting to chill  
You don’t roll with us, ‘cause we’re the real deal  
Worms don’t mix, fake friends are trash  
Kunai’s in the clip, here you don’t lie  
Uchiha Massaru, you know I’m ahead  
Shining kunai  
You think you’re brave, but when it’s time to talk, the conversation’s different  
Ninja, you understand how hard I fought  
Chunin exam, I spelled it out, spelled it out  
Grade F800 on the back has my saber  
Mixtape Shuriken, my dude, the type to salute, ayy  
You’re nodding your head listening to Shuriken  
Your girl in the DMs wanting to chill  
You don’t roll with us, ‘cause we’re the real deal  
Worms don’t mix, fake friends are trash  
Kunai’s in the clip, here you don’t lie  
Uchiha Massaru, you know I’m ahead  
Shining kunai  
You think you’re brave, but when it’s time to talk, the conversation’s different  
Ninja, you understand how hard I fought  
Chunin exam, I spelled it out, spelled it out  
Grade F800 on the back has my saber  
Mixtape Shuriken, my dude, the type to salute  

**[Chorus]**  
I keep devastating the scene  
My hits that provoke and you all revere  
No one can stop me, I’m the bullet train of the village  
Advanced shinobi a thousand years ahead of the land  
Ah, I keep devastating the scene  
My hits that provoke and you all revere  
No one can stop me, I’m the bullet train of the village  
Advanced shinobi a thousand years ahead of the land
