**[Intro]**  
Showing off, man  
Ye-ah  
Ye-ah  
Ye-ah, ya-ya  

**[Chorus]**  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  

**[Verse 1]**  
People stare because I'm frozen (Prr-prr)  
It's so cold I even caught a cold (Yessir!)  
Ye-ye-ah, my cup is overflowing (Oh shit)  
With this molly, man, I'm feeling high (Skrtt-skrtt)  
In the Bugatti, expert at overtaking, hum-uh-hum (Vrum-vrum)  
Tired of cars, I want a spaceship, yeh (Pew-pew)  
Everyone's tripping on my trip, hum-uh-hum  
Ye-ye-ah, foreigner in the city, ye-eh  
With packages, baby, I'm doing fine  
No one wanted to hang with me when I was nobody  
Now I grab your attention when I show off the VVS  
They've been watching me flaunt it on TV, ya-ya  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've already said I'm going to explore the world  
Man, I keep stacking, I only know how to count  
Young Dex is counting money inside the Jaguar  
I've told you, man, I only enter the game to win, yeah  

**[Chorus]**  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon (So crazy, man)  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon (So crazy, man)  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  

**[Verse 2]**  
Ye-yeah  
What kind of mix was that, my man?  
That even made me sleepy  
Twenty thousand in my pocket  
Forty thousand for my crew, yeah  
Only 17 years old, a business kid  
I've traveled a lot on foot, now in a Batmobile, ya  
I'm tired, last night's show was insane  
My tour is worldwide, look at what I'm conquering  
Forget the fake friends  
Man, I know who my real ones are  
These girls want to be with me because I'm winning  

**[Bridge]**  
Man, I'm going a thousand, ya-ya-ya-ya  
Singing and profiting, ya-ya-ya-ya  
My crew that stays, ya-ya-ya-ya  
Your body bleeding, ya-ya-ya-ya  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've already said I'm going to explore the world  
Man, I keep stacking, I only know how to count  
Young Dex is counting money inside the Jaguar  
I've told you, man, I only enter the game to win, yeah  

**[Chorus]**  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon (So much molly, man)  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon (So much molly, man)  
Flexin', flexin', I ended up on the moon (Skrtt-skrtt)
