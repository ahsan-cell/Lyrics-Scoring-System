**Translated Lyrics:**

From glass to glass, one day at a time  
Thinking of returning, there’s no shortage of reasons  
My God, what have you done to me?!

Removing the ice from my whiskey glass with my finger  
And tossing it on the floor  
In your chest, the empty side  
And your name written on my palm

The bar door is closing  
The waiter giving a hint: We’re about to shut down  
I don’t know if I should pretend I can’t hear  
Or leave this place and find another bar

The car keys on the table  
My phone in hand, almost out of battery  
It’s like this every day

And then I’ll suffer  
Suffering, I’ll cry  
Crying, I’ll drink  
Drinking, I’ll call  
She won’t answer

And then I’ll suffer  
Suffering, I’ll cry  
Crying, I’ll drink  
Drinking, I’ll call  
She won’t answer
