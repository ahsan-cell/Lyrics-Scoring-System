**Translated Lyrics:**

So...
Oh, you want to mess with me?
There's just one little problem: I'm trained

[Verse: Kevinho]
(So) She wants to mess with me
Said I’m weak, that I’m this and I’m that
(So) She knows very well we never had anything
And to show off, she swears she broke up with me

[Pre-Chorus: Kevinho]
(So) She's gonna hit the ground hard
There’s no chance
It might work with someone else, but not with me
(So) She's gonna hit the ground hard
You can’t even believe it
I’m dying to see her throwing herself on the dance floor

[Chorus: MC Kevinho]
If she wants to dance (so) let her dance
If she wants to kiss then let her kiss
If she wants to "fanfanranranranran"
I don’t care at all
Everyone has their own schemes

[Chorus: Kevinho]
If she wants to dance (so) let her dance
If she wants to kiss then let her kiss
If she wants to "fanfanranranranran"
I don’t care at all
Got it? Go with your schemes (everyone has their own schemes)

[Bridge: Kevinho]
(So) Ladies and gentlemen
You do your thing, I’ll do mine over here, man
Can you believe it?
Hey, Kevinho! (So)

[Verse: Matheus and Kauan]
She wants to mess with me
Said I’m weak, that I’m this and I’m that
(So) She knows very well we never had anything
And to show off, she swears she broke up with me

[Pre-Chorus: Matheus and Kauan]
(So) She's gonna hit the ground hard
There’s no chance (I know)
It might work with someone else, but not with me (not here!)
She's gonna hit the ground hard
You can’t even believe it (can you believe it?)
I’m dying to see her throwing herself on the dance floor

[Chorus: Matheus and Kauan]
If she wants to dance (so) let her dance
If she wants to kiss then let her kiss
If she wants to "fanfanranranranran"
I don’t care at all
Everyone has their own schemes

[Chorus: Matheus and Kauan]
If she wants to dance (so) let her dance
If she wants to kiss then let her kiss
If she wants to "fanfanranranranran"
I don’t care at all
Everyone has their (what?) schemes

[Chorus: Matheus and Kauan]
(So) If she wants to dance then let her dance
If she wants to kiss then let her kiss
If she wants to "fanfanranranranran"
I don’t care at all, everyone (with what?)
With their schemes!

[Outro: Kevinho]
Full of schemes, huh?
Who would’ve thought?!
So call me, man!
"Fanfanranranran"
