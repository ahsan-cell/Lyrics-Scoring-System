**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Simaria]  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  
Crazy, crazy, crazy  

[Verse 1: Simaria]  
Where are you, that no one has seen?  
You disappeared, vanished into thin air  
You're out there trying to forget  
The jerk who made you suffer  

[Verse 2: Anitta]  
Where are you? Where have you hidden?  
Why suffer, if he didn't deserve you?  
You keep sitting on the fence  
Hoping for change in someone with no future  

[Bridge: Simaria]  
Leave that guy behind  
You just chose the wrong man  
Suffering in the present because of your past  
What good is it to cry over spilled milk?  

[Pre-Chorus: Simone]  
Put on that outfit and lipstick  
Get in the car, girl, turn up the music  

[Chorus: Simone]  
And play a good song  
Let’s enjoy the night like queens  
Flirt with some guys, kiss on the lips  
Make the most of the night, go wild  

[Chorus: Anitta]  
And play a good song  
Let’s enjoy the night like queens  
Flirt with some guys, kiss on the lips  
Make the most of the night, go wild  

[Post-Chorus: Simaria]  
Forget him and go wild, wild, wild  
Now cry on your queen's shoulder, wild, wild  
Forget him and go wild, wild, wild  
Now cry on your queen's shoulder, wild, wild  

[Verse 1: Simaria]  
Where are you, that no one has seen?  
You disappeared, vanished into thin air  
You're out there trying to forget  
The jerk who made you suffer  

[Verse 2: Anitta]  
Where are you? Where have you hidden?  
Why suffer, if he didn't deserve you?  
You keep sitting on the fence  
Hoping for change in someone with no future  

[Bridge: Simaria]  
Leave that guy behind  
You just chose the wrong man  
Suffering in the present because of your past  
What good is it to cry over spilled milk?  

[Pre-Chorus: Simone]  
Put on that outfit and lipstick  
Get in the car, girl, turn up the music  

[Chorus: Simone]  
And play a good song  
Let’s enjoy the night like queens  
Flirt with some guys, kiss on the lips  
Make the most of the night, go wild  
And play a good song  
Let’s enjoy the night like queens  
Flirt with some guys, kiss on the lips  
Make the most of the night, go wild  

[Post-Chorus: Simaria]  
Forget him and go wild, wild, wild  
Now cry on your queen's shoulder, wild, wild  
Forget him and go wild, wild, wild  
Now cry on your queen's shoulder, wild, wild  

[Outro: Simaria]  
Simone  
Simaria  
Anitta  
Crazy
