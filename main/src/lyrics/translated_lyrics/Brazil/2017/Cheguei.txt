**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
I’ve arrived (I’ve arrived)  
I came in strong  
Making a mess of everything  
And who cares  
I just want it all to blow up  
Because no one’s going to ruin my day  
Let them know, go ahead and say  
That I’ve arrived (I’ve arrived)  
I came in strong  
Making a mess of everything  
And who cares  
I just want it all to blow up  
Because no one’s going to ruin my day  
Let them know, go ahead and say  

[Verse 1]  
I came in with everything  
I came breaking it all  
You can look at me, turn off the lights and turn up the sound  
The jealous ones lose their minds  
The fakes conspire  
I have a gift for stirring up envy  
   
[Pre-Chorus]  
If you don’t like it, sit down and cry  
Today I feel like causing trouble  
If you don’t like it, sit down and cry  
But I left home to make a scene  

[Chorus]  
I’ve arrived (I’ve arrived)  
I came in strong  
Making a mess of everything  
And who cares  
I just want it all to blow up  
Because no one’s going to ruin my day  
Let them know, go ahead and say  
That I’ve arrived (I’ve arrived)  
I came in strong  
Making a mess of everything  
And who cares  
I just want it all to blow up  
Because no one’s going to ruin my day  
Let them know, go ahead and say  

[Verse 2]  
I came in with everything  
I came breaking it all  
You can look at me, turn off the lights and turn up the sound  
The jealous ones lose their minds  
The fakes conspire  
I have a gift for stirring up envy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If you don’t like it, sit down and cry  
Today I feel like causing trouble  
If you don’t like it, sit down and cry  
But I left home to make a scene  

[Chorus]  
I’ve arrived (I’ve arrived)  
I came in strong  
Making a mess of everything  
And who cares  
I just want it all to blow up  
Because no one’s going to ruin my day  
Let them know, go ahead and say  
That I’ve arrived (I’ve arrived)  
I came in strong  
Making a mess of everything  
And who cares  
I just want it all to blow up  
Today no one’s going to ruin my day  
Let them know, go ahead and say  

[Outro]  
That I’ve arrived
