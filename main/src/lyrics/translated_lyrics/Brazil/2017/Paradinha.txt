**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I want to see you go crazy  
I want to provoke you, you'll see that when  
I want something, I can make it happen  
If you don't know me, don't doubt me, because  
I want to see you go crazy  
I want to provoke you, and I know you don't  
Admit it, but I can see  
You're dying to see me do that  

[Chorus]  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  

[Post-Chorus]  
I turned your world upside down  
Are you going to deny it again?  
If you tell me the truth, maybe  
I'll start now in one, two, three, go  

[Chorus]  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  

[Bridge]  
You're scared, you want me  
Only in your way, I'm not a saint  
I have attitude, yes, I'm not easy  
But you love it because you forget everything with  

[Chorus]  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  

[Post-Chorus]  
I turned your world upside down  
Are you going to deny it again?  
If you tell me the truth, maybe  
I'll start now in one, two, three, go  

[Chorus]  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah  
A little pause  
A little pause, ah-ah-ah-ah
