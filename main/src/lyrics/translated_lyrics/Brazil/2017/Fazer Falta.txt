**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
When you hear me out,  
You’ll see this isn’t drama, mm  
You need to think it through,  
A kiss doesn’t just mean a hookup.  
But who am I? If you want to come here,  
I’ll contradict myself and won’t hold back.  
I wrote this song to encourage you,  
But if you change, it’ll be a loss.

[Pre-Chorus]  
If your hobby is to sit, I won’t judge you,  
Congratulations, congratulations.  
But I need you for the vibe to be right,  
So sit well, sit well.

[Chorus]  
So shake it, so shake that booty on the ground, booty on the ground,  
So shake it, so shake that big behind, that big behind.  
So shake it, so shake that booty on the ground, booty on the ground,  
So shake it, so shake that big behind, that big behind.

So shake it, so shake that big behind, that big behind.  
So shake it, so shake that booty on the ground, booty on the ground,  
So shake it, so shake that big behind, that big behind.
