**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Hey there? It's Kevin and Jorgin again  
Who would have thought, huh?

[Verse]  
It's the new summer hit for everyone to enjoy  
She lifts her hips up high, it's hard to resist  
Don't even try to play innocent, the vibe is right  
Come on, drop it low, rise up, shake it, show your talent

[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm rolling with a combo of Jack, Cîroc, and Chandon  
Look at the young ones dancing to the beat

[Chorus]  
I'm gonna make the bass drop  
And I want to see those hips move  
I'm gonna make the bass drop  
And I want to see those hips move

[Verse]  
It's the new summer hit for everyone to enjoy  
She lifts her hips up high, it's hard to resist  
Don't even try to play innocent, the vibe is right  
Come on, drop it low, rise up, shake it, show your talent

[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm rolling with a combo of Jack, Cîroc, and Chandon  
Look at the young ones dancing to the beat

[Chorus]  
I'm gonna make the bass drop  
And I want to see those hips move  
I'm gonna make the bass drop  
And I want to see those hips move

[Outro]  
I believe, and you?  
Do you believe?
