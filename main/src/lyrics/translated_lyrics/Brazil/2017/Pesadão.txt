**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: IZA]  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Dão, dão, dão, dão  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  

[Verse 1: IZA]  
I will rebuild my castle  
With iron and hammer  
Reclaim what I lost  
I know they will try to destroy me  
But I will reconstruct myself  
Come back stronger than before  

[Verse 2: IZA]  
When the wickedness passed through here  
And sadness made its home  
Light from the sky visited me  
And made a dwelling within  
When fear took hold  
Bringing senseless wars  
The hope that remained  
Keeps on vibrating  

[Pre-Chorus: IZA]  
And it made me fight to win  
To rise up and grow  
Fists clenched, eyes closed  
I raise my hand high and shout:  
"Come with me if you're part of the heavy crew!"  

[Chorus: IZA]  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  

[Verse 3: Marcelo Falcão]  
Still raising my castles  
Voices and echoes  
This way I won’t lose myself  
Infinite dreams  
Voices and screams  
To call those who can’t hear  

[Verse 4: Marcelo Falcão]  
From Engenho Novo to Australia  
Ready for battle  
Head held high to keep moving  
If they try to stop us, it’s not that easy  
We’ll be stronger than before  

[Pre-Chorus: Marcelo Falcão]  
From South to North, resonant packages  
Music of the soul for the wise and strong  
Game of Thrones can’t mess with us  
My pride is our sound  
IZA and Falcão are part of the heavy crew  

[Chorus: IZA & Marcelo Falcão]  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão  

[Bridge: IZA]  
Heavy-dão  
Heavy-dão  
Heavy-dão  
Heavy-dão  
Heavy-dão  
Heavy-dão  
Heavy-dão  

[Verse 5: IZA]  
If theirs is fancy  
Ours is raw and real  
What doesn’t kill the vibe  
Strengthens the team  
The sound of the beat  
I ask you to amplify  
From Rocinha  
It reaches Mozambique  

[Bridge: Marcelo Falcão]  
Wise words from your company  
Many steps, steps on your path  
Attitude, straight talk, heavy, dialect  
Beat like chalk lightning  
IZA as the empress  
Friendships and bonds, new castles  
IZA and Falcão are part of the heavy, heavy crew  

[Chorus: IZA & Marcelo Falcão]  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão  
Ooh, ooh-ô-oh  
Just heavy, heavy-dão
