**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Your love caught me  
You hit me so hard with your love  
Knocked me out, made me dizzy  
Came to the surface, I hit the mat, it was K.O.  

[Verse]  
I've always been a fighter, but it was right from the start  
I found myself defenseless, my heart lost the battle, yes  
Goodbye to drunken nights, single life  
I want to be with you in my bed on Friday, together, close  
Kiss me all night long, sexy in the bathtub  
I’ll keep you on your toes, I want it from start to finish  
And fix your gaze, I’ll keep looking at you  
I’ll tell you, I hit the mat with your—

[Chorus]  
Your love caught me  
You hit me so hard with your love  
Knocked me out, made me dizzy  
Came to the surface, I hit the mat, it was K.O.  
Your love caught me  
You hit me so hard with your love  
Knocked me out, made me dizzy  
Came to the surface, I hit the mat, it was K.O.  

[Outro]  
I surrendered and declared K.O.  
I surrendered and declared K.O.
