**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Three days abandoned,  
She lost her boyfriend,  
The beast has been unleashed,  
Her heart is now free.  
Poor soul who fell in love,  
Now the beautiful, modest girl is furious,  
She put on a sexy little dress and went out to shake things up,  
Even the blind stopped to take a look.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even the singer paused the show to applaud,  
She stole the scene, the chapter, and the whole season,  
When she moves, it’s no joke.

[Chorus]  
All she wants  
Is a bottle of champagne  
And a bucket of ice, oooh,  
And she’s going down,  
And she’s going down.

[Post-Chorus]  
She just wants to have fun,  
Floor, floor, floor,  
A lot of fun,  
Floor, floor, floor,  
And she’s going down to the floor.

[Outro]  
Now I’m dancing,  
I’m pure adrenaline,  
Now I’m all alone,  
But feeling hot,  
I leave you crazy  
With my boom boom,  
I dance close to you  
With my boom boom.
