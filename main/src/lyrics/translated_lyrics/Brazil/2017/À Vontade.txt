**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s about to start  
The band strikes up the chords of a song  
Couples get ready to enter the hall  
Announcing that we can’t stop  
Oooh, don’t stop  

[Verse 2: Ivete Sangalo]  
From over here  
My heart races just at the sight of you  
And I pretend that you’re not there  
But the rhythm begins to pull me in  
Oooh, don’t stop  

[Pre-Chorus: Ivete Sangalo]  
You waved from one side  
And I waved back  
We suggest a little chat  
I’m going to fall in love  
I’m starting to feel it  
Only God knows where the night will lead  

[Chorus: Ivete Sangalo 2x]  
We feel at ease  
Get into the groove and start to dance (to dance, yeah)  
In this wave  
We get lost together  
And begin to dance (to dance)  

[Verse 3: Wesley Safadão]  
Nice to meet you  
I want to see you move without stopping  
Hold me tight  
And press your face against mine  
Hold on tight and then start to spin  
And don’t stop  

[Verse 4: Wesley Safadão]  
Once more  
Wrap me in your arms  
I want to feel  
Your warmth in a sensual dance  
And get ready  
I’ll want it again  
Oooh, don’t stop  

[Pre-Chorus: Ivete Sangalo & Wesley Safadão]  
Come close to me  
Get lost in the sound  
I can see that the night is ours  
Everything feels good like this  
When it’s natural  
When we’re drawn to each other on the dance floor  

[Chorus: Ivete Sangalo & Wesley Safadão 2x]  
We feel at ease  
Get into the groove and start to dance (to dance, yeah)  
In this wave  
We get lost together  
And begin to dance (to dance)  

[Bridge: Ivete Sangalo]  
Come dance, come dance  
Fall in love  
Come, come dance  
Fall in love  

[Pre-Chorus: Ivete Sangalo & Wesley Safadão]  
You waved from one side  
And I waved back  
We suggest a little chat  
I’m going to fall in love  
I’m starting to feel it  
Only God knows where the night will lead  

[Chorus: Ivete Sangalo & Wesley Safadão]  
We feel at ease  
Get into the groove and start to dance (to dance, yeah)  
In this wave  
We get lost together  
And begin to dance (to dance)  

[Outro: Ivete Sangalo & Wesley Safadão]  
We start to dance  
Come, come, come dance (to dance, yeah)  
So come (come, come, come dance)  
To dance, yeah
