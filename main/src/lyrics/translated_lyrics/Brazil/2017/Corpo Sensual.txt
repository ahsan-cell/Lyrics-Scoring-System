**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: Pabllo Vittar]  
Going all out  
In the rhythm's addiction, wanting to get involved  
A different style that captivates and brings pleasure  
I know soon you'll feel it, it drives you insane  
I make it boil  
Going all out  
In the rhythm's addiction, wanting to get involved  
A different style that captivates and brings pleasure  
I know soon you'll feel it, it drives you insane  
I make it boil  

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]  
You’re gonna feel unwell  
I’ll turn your mind with my sensual body  
My mouth is hot, come  
There’s no one like me  
You’re all needy with that casual request  
You’re gonna feel unwell...  
You’re gonna feel unwell  
I’ll turn your mind with my sensual body  
My mouth is hot, come  
There’s no one like me  
You’re all needy with that casual request  
You’re gonna feel unwell...  

[Interlude: Pabllo Vittar]  
Oh, daddy  
Come on, Teteu, get close to me, come  
Oh!  

[Verse: Mateus Carrilho]  
Going all out  
In the rhythm's addiction, wanting to get involved  
A different style that captivates and brings pleasure  
I know soon you'll feel it, it drives you insane  
I make it boil  
Going all out  
In the rhythm's addiction, wanting to get involved  
A different style that captivates and brings pleasure  
I know soon you'll feel it, it drives you insane  
I make it boil  

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]  
You’re gonna feel unwell  
I’ll turn your mind with my sensual body  
My mouth is hot, come  
There’s no one like me  
You’re all needy with that casual request  
You’re gonna feel unwell...  
You’re gonna feel unwell  
I’ll turn your mind with my sensual body  
My mouth is hot, come  
There’s no one like me  
You’re all needy with that casual request  
You’re gonna feel unwell...  

[Bridge: Pabllo Vittar & Mateus Carrilho]  
Oh, daddy!  
Come on, mama, come!  
Come on, girl, come!  
Come on, boy, come!  
Let’s break it down!  

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar & Mateus Carrilho]  
You’re gonna feel unwell  
I’ll turn your mind with my sensual body  
My mouth is hot, come  
There’s no one like me  
You’re all needy with that casual request  
You’re gonna feel unwell...  
You’re gonna feel unwell  
I’ll turn your mind with my sensual body  
My mouth is hot, come  
There’s no one like me  
You’re all needy with that casual request  
You’re gonna feel unwell...  

[Outro: Mateus Carrilho]  
So hot!
