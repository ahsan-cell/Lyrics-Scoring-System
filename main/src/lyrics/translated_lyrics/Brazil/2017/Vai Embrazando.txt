**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Vigary & Zaac]  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
You know what’s missing?  
What’s missing is a real Catuaba to get the vibe going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Like, how am I supposed to talk about Catuaba  
If I’m not drinking?  
It’s like this, oh  
Tu-dum-dum-dum  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  

[Verse: Zaac]  
She got together with her friend and came over to my place (Ah)  
Opens the fridge, grabs the Catuaba (Tu-dum-dum-dum)  
After a few drinks, she got excited (Ah; damn!)  
After a few drinks, she got excited  
I heard you’re a little wild (Ah)  
So, stop...  
You can already get naked (Tu-dum-dum-dum)  
Don’t mind that the house is a mess (Ah)  
If she’s stuck, my music will free her (Ah)  
Especially since you look a bit naughty (Ah)  
The night is young, soon we’ll be there  
But, taking advantage that the warm-up is here  

[Chorus: Zaac]  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  

[Verse: MC Vigary, Zaac & Yuri Martins]  
She got together with her friend and came over to my place (Ah)  
Opens the fridge, grabs the Catuaba (Tu-dum-dum-dum)  
After a few drinks, she got excited (Ah)  
I heard you’re a little wild (Ah)  
So, stop...  
You can already get naked (Tu-dum-dum-dum)  
Don’t mind that the house is a mess (Ah)  
If she’s stuck, my music will free her (Ah)  
Especially since you look... (No, ah)  
Especially since you’re quite the troublemaker  

[Pause: Yuri Martins, MC Vigary & Zaac]  
No, it’s not like that, no  
It’s not like that, damn  
Isn’t it like that?  
Tu-dum-dum-dum  
[Verse: Zaac, MC Vigary, Both]  
Stop (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)  
You can already get naked  
Don’t mind (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)  
That the house is a mess (Tu-dum-dum-dum)  
If she’s stuck, my music will free her (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)  
Especially since you look a bit naughty (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)  
The night is young, soon we’ll be there  
But, taking advantage that the warm-up is here  

[Chorus: MC Vigary & Zaac]  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Keep it going  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  

[Outro: Zaac]  
You know what’s missing?  
What’s missing is a real Catuaba to get the vibe going (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)  
Like, how am I supposed to talk about Catuaba  
If I’m not drinking?  
Tu-dum-dum-dum  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Tu-dum-dum-dum
