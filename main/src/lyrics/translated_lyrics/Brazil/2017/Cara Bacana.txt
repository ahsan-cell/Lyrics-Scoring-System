**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
DJ Jorginho, I'm your fan  
And let it go, let it go, ahn, come on  

[Verse]  
It was hard for you to believe that I'm a good guy  
And when we fight, that's when you see we love each other more  
So forget about that and come here to bed with all you've got  
It was hard for you to believe that I'm a good guy  
And when we fight, that's when you see we love each other more  
So forget about that and come here to bed with all you've got  
That's why you love me  

[Chorus]  
Love  
I'm that guy you're looking at  
I'm a bit problematic, a little jealous  
But you know I'm great in bed  
That's why you love me  
Love  
I'm that guy you're looking at  
I'm a bit problematic, a little jealous  
But you know I'm great in bed  
That's why you love me  

[Interlude]  
MC G15  
Golden pen  
And let it go, let it go, ahn, come on  

[Verse]  
It was hard for you to believe that I'm a good guy  
And when we fight, that's when you see we love each other more  
So forget about that and come here to bed with all you've got  
It was hard for you to believe that I'm a good guy  
And when we fight, that's when you see we love each other more  
So forget about that and come here to bed with all you've got  
That's why you love me  

[Chorus]  
Love  
I'm that guy you're looking at  
I'm a bit problematic, a little jealous  
But you know I'm great in bed  
That's why you love me  
Love  
I'm that guy you're looking at  
I'm a bit problematic, a little jealous  
But you know I'm great in bed  
That's why you love me
