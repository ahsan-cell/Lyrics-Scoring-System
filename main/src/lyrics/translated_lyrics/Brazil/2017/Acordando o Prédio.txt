**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Where has your sense gone?  
It's already four in the morning  
Soon the landlord will call:  
"Is there any way for the lady to keep it down?  
I know it's good, but the walls have ears."  
And it was supposed to be hidden, since it’s not anymore...

[Chorus]  
Let’s wake up this building  
Make the neighbors jealous  
While they’re off to work  
We’ll make sweet love again  
Let’s wake up this building  
Make the neighbors jealous  
While they’re off to work  
We’ll make sweet love again, again, again

[Bridge]  
Let the world know, baby, how you are  
And we’ll deal with the problems later, right?  
Because when you come down, the moon comes down to see  
You’ve already won me over, now just take me to you
