**Translated Lyrics:**

Check out the clauses  
Sign below  
And don’t change a thing  

You’ll have to wake up with a kiss every morning  
And accept coffee in bed with mint tea  
Get a foot massage in a bubble bath  
And after dinner, the dishes are mine, not yours  
I’m making it clear right now  

This contract is lifelong  
You’re tied here with me  
In this love contract  
The cancellation fee is a million  
Where are you going to get that?  

This contract is lifelong  
You’re tied here with me  
In this love contract  
The cancellation fee is a million  
Where are you going to get that?  
You’re tied here with me  

I’m going to make a contract  
Check out the clauses  
Sign below  
And don’t change a thing  

You’ll have to wake up with a kiss every morning  
And accept coffee in bed with mint tea  
Get a foot massage in a bubble bath  
And after dinner, the dishes are mine, not yours  
I’m making it clear right now  

This contract is lifelong  
You’re tied here with me  
In this love contract  
The cancellation fee is a million  
Where are you going to get that?  

This contract is lifelong  
You’re tied here with me  
In this love contract  
The cancellation fee is a million  
Where are you going to get that?  
You’re tied here with me  

This contract is lifelong  
You’re tied here with me  
In this love contract  
The cancellation fee is a million  
Where are you going to get that?  
You’re tied here with me
