**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I woke up before six on a Sunday and didn’t even mind  
I kicked the foot of the bed, and for that, I didn’t complain  
Because under this sky  
Everything makes sense, has reason, and has a why  
If I already have this love  
Then there’s nothing more that I could want, yeah  

[Chorus]  
I just want the world to be a little softer, more loyal  
If there’s going to be war, then let it be a war of love  
More genuine smiles  
And more people changing life for the better  

(Oh oh oh oh)  

[Verse 2]  
Because under this sky  
Everything makes sense, has reason, and has a why  
If I already have this love  
Then there’s nothing more that I could want  
But there are so many things I can do, yeah  

[Chorus]  
I just want the world to be a little softer, more loyal  
If there’s going to be war, then let it be a war of love  
More genuine smiles  
And more people changing life for the better  
(Oh oh oh oh)
