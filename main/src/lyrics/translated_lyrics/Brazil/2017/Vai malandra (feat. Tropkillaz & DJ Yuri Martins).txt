**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Zaac]  
Hey, look there (Heavy)  
You won't believe what...  
Just touch the...  
I don't know what we're going to have...  
Look there, all excited  
Look there, playing, man (Are you crazy?)  

[Chorus: MC Zaac]  
Go, go, girl, ahn, ahn  
Wow, crazy, you're playing with your butt, ahn, ahn  
Tutudum, ahn, ahn  
Go, girl, ahn, ahn  
Wow, crazy, you're playing with your butt, ahn, ahn  
Tutudum, ahn, ahn  

[Verse 1: Anitta & MC Zaac]  
You're asking for it, ahn, ahn  
Get ready, I'm going to dance, pay attention, ahn, ahn  
Tutudum, ahn, ahn  
Can you handle it, ahn, ahn  
If I look at you, drop it low and bounce to the ground? (She plays, right?)  
Tutudum, ahn, ahn  

[Verse 2: MC Zaac & Anitta]  
Drop it, shake it nicely  
Lift it while looking at me, I'll catch you just right  
If I start getting into it with you, it's:  
"Thump, thump, thump, thump"  
I drop it, shake it nicely  
Lift it while looking at you, I'll catch you just right  
If I start getting into it with you, it's, ah  

[Hook: Anitta & Maejor]  
I won't stop anymore  
You can handle it  
I won't stop anymore (Ayy)  
You can handle it (Yeah, what's up, bruh?)  

[Verse 3: Maejor & MC Zaac]  
Go, girl, show me something  
Brazilian baby, you know I want ya  
Booty big, sit a glass on it  
See my zipper, put that ass on it (Ahn, ahn)  
Hypnotized by the way you shake it  
I can't lie, I'm trying to see you naked  
Anitta, baby, I'm trying to spank it  
I can give it to you, can you take it?  

[Pre-Chorus: MC Zaac]  
You're already wild, drinking  
So loose, getting into it  
I can see it, don’t stop, no  

[Chorus: MC Zaac, Anitta, Maejor, MC Zaac & Anitta]  
Go, girl, ahn, ahn  
Wow, crazy, you're playing with your butt, ahn, ahn  
Tutudum, ahn, ahn  
So naughty, ahn, ahn  
I'm crazy, I'm playing with my butt, ahn, ahn (She plays, right?)  
Go, girl, ahn, ahn  
Turn around and put it down on me, ahn, ahn  
Baby, ahn, ahn  
Go, girl, ahn, ahn  
Wow, crazy, I'm playing with my butt, ahn, ahn  
Baby, ahn, ahn  

[Verse 2: MC Zaac & Anitta]  
Drop it, shake it nicely  
Lift it while looking at me, I'll catch you just right  
If I start getting into it with you, it's:  
"Thump, thump, thump, thump"  
I drop it, shake it nicely  
Lift it while looking at you, I'll catch you just right  
If I start getting into it with you, it's, ah  

[Hook: Anitta]  
I won't stop anymore  
You can handle it  
I won't stop anymore  
You can handle it  

[Verse 5: Maejor & MC Zaac]  
Yeah, throw it back on me and Zaac (Ayy)  
Make it clap, yeah, I'm into that (Ayy)  
Pulling tracks, yeah, I'm into that (Ayy)  
From the back, yeah, I'm into that (Ahn, ayy)  
Big dog to the kitty cat (Ah)  
Young boss where the Millis at (Ayy)  
In the favela where it's lit (Ayy)  
And all of Brazil is feeling that  

[Pre-Chorus: MC Zaac]  
You're already wild, drinking  
So loose, getting into it  
I can see it, don’t stop, no  

[Chorus: MC Zaac, Anitta, Maejor, MC Zaac & Anitta]  
Go, girl, ahn, ahn  
Wow, crazy, you're playing with your butt, ahn, ahn  
Tutudum, ahn, ahn  
Go, girl, ahn, ah
