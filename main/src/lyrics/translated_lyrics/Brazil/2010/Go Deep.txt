**Translated Lyrics:**

I-I-I-I go deep

[Verse 1: Kamille]  
Blue like love that hurts  
This is lightning  
Future spaces  
Taking my heart  
Did you move in circles  
With my body?  
You're the heaven  
Like I'm living  

[Pre-Chorus: Kamille]  
Wanna be, wanna be close to you  
Wanna be, wanna be right  
Never be, never be good for you  
Never be, never be right  
Follow you until there’s no light  
'Cause I wanna be, I wanna be  

[Chorus: Kamille]  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight  
I go deep for your touch  
Deep for your heart  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight  
I go deep for your touch  
Deep for your heart  

[Post-Chorus: Kamille]  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight, I go deep  

[Verse 2: Kamille]  
Starts like danger  
Superhuman  
Found my empire  
Laying here beside you  
Hidden covers  
Your heart rising  
Thirst like oceans  
Deeper inside of you  

[Pre-Chorus: Kamille]  
Wanna be, wanna be close to you  
Wanna be, wanna be right  
Never be, never be good for you  
Never be, never be right  
Follow you until there’s no light  
'Cause I wanna be, I wanna be  

[Chorus: Kamille]  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight  
I go deep for your touch  
Deep for your heart  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight  
I go deep for your touch  
Deep for your heart  

[Post-Chorus: Kamille]  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight, I go deep  

[Bridge: Kamille]  
So deep, so deep, so deep  
So deep, so deep, so deep  
So deep, so deep, so deep  
So deep, so deep, so deep  
So deep, so deep, so deep  
So deep, so deep, so deep  

[Chorus: Kamille]  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight  
I go deep for your touch  
Deep for your heart  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight  
I go deep for your touch  
Deep for your heart  

[Post-Chorus: Kamille]  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep, deep, deep, deep  
Deep, deep, deep, deep  
I go deep for your love  
Deep for tonight, I go deep
