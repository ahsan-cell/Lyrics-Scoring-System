**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I hate loving this  
I hate loving the way you leave me wanting  
Wanting for your touch, but you don’t give it  
Just give it to me when you want  
I know you’ll want to  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But when you come to me, when you come to me  
I want you to give it all to me, but you never stay  
I’m not going home tonight (I’m not going home tonight)  
Unless you come with me  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  

[Chorus]  
Don’t say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Stay for one more night, night, night, night, night  
You do it so well  
Don’t say goodbye  
Don’t say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Stay for one more night, night, night, night, night  
You do it so well  
Don’t say goodbye  

[Verse 2]  
Love me wanting  
Something about my desire keeps you going  
A hook-up everywhere we’re alone  
So tease me on the dance floor until dawn  
Yeah, until dawn  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But when you come to me, when you come to me  
I want you to give it all to me, but you never stay  
I’m not going home tonight (I’m not going home tonight)  
Unless you come with me  
Ooh-na-na, ooh-na-na  

[Chorus]  
Don’t say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Stay for one more night, night, night, night, night  
You do it so well  
Don’t say goodbye  
Don’t say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Stay for one more night, night, night, night, night  
You do it so well  
Don’t say goodbye  

[Bridge]  
The way you move me, I can’t control  
I just want to be the one to take you home  
You tell me you want, you want it too  
But you leave me waiting  

[Outro]  
Don’t say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Stay for one more night, night, night, night, night  
You do it so well  
Don’t say goodbye  
Don’t say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye (don’t say goodbye)  
Stay for one more night, night, night, night, night (one more night)  
So well  
Don’t say goodbye
