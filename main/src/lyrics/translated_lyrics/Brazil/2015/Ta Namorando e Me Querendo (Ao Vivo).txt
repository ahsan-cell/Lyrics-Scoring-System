**Translated Lyrics:**

Does everyone still know that you love me?  
It's written in your eyes, trying to hide it  
But when you go to sleep, you call my name  

I'll say I wasn't surprised  
When you had your friend  
Give me your number at that party that day  
Now it's my turn to get back at you  
I'm calling to tell you:  

Am I the one who's a villain,  
A liar and a womanizer?  
Look at you, you're dating but still wanting me  
I'm calling you, but it's not to win you back  
It's to tell you, this isn't going to work.
