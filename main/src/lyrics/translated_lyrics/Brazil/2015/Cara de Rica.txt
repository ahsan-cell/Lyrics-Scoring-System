**Translated Lyrics:**

She’s taking charge  
Catching the bus at seven  
She’s working hard  
All covered in tattoos  
Brush in her hair  
She knows no limits  
She feels no fear  
She’s got confidence  
All powerful  
She puts on a rich face  
Always dressed to impress  
She doesn’t play coy  
She won’t give you the time of day  
She’ll seduce you  
Until you can’t take it anymore  

Puts on a rich face  
Puts on a rich face  
Just keeps teasing  
Because she knows she’s beautiful  
Puts on a rich face  
Puts on a rich face  
She’s dangerous  
This girl is poison  

Puts on a rich face  
Rich face  
Just keeps teasing  
Because she knows she’s beautiful  
Puts on a rich face  
Puts on a rich face  
She’s dangerous  
This girl is poison  

Imported perfume  
She’s making waves  
Size 36 shoes, strutting in heels, teasing  
With a girl’s charm  
And a woman’s attitude  
She puts on a rich face  
That’s what she wants  
She’s got confidence  
All powerful  
Puts on a rich face  
Always dressed to impress  
She doesn’t play coy  
Nor gives too much attention  
She’ll seduce you  
Until you can’t take it anymore  

Puts on a rich face  
Puts on a rich face  
Just keeps teasing  
Because she knows she’s beautiful  
Puts on a rich face  
Puts on a rich face  
She’s dangerous  
This girl is poison  

Puts on a rich face  
Rich face  
Just keeps teasing  
Because she knows she’s beautiful  
Puts on a rich face  
Puts on a rich face  
She’s dangerous  
This girl is poison
