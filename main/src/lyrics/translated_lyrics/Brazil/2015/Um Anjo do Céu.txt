**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
An angel from heaven brought to me  
The most beautiful one, the perfect jewel  
For me to care for, for me to love  
A crystal drop holds all the innocence  

[Chorus]  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  

[Verse 2]  
An angel from heaven who chose me  
I’ll be your harbor, guardian of purity  
For me to care for, for me to love  
A crystal drop holds all the innocence  

[Chorus]  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  

[Bridge]  
I’ll sing for you  

[Chorus]  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you  
Come, oh my dear, don’t cry now  
I’ll sing for you
