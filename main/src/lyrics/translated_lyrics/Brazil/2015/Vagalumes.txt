**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Ivo Mozart]  
I’ll chase more than a million fireflies out there  
To see you smile, I can paint the sky another color  
I just want to love you  
And when the dawn breaks, I want to wake up  
By your side  

[Verse 1: Adriel]  
I’ll write another million songs for you to hear  
My love is yours, your smile makes me cheer  
I’ll go from Mars to the Moon, you know I’m already yours  
And there’s no room for so much longing, that’s the truth, raw and pure  
I know what I’m doing, I’m charting our way  
A couple outside the law, sharing the same space  
If I’m with you, I don’t care if the Sun doesn’t shine  
It just doesn’t make sense to walk without holding your hand  
Your impossible dream will become reality  
I know the world is terrible, but it won’t be the cruelty that  
Takes me away from you, I’ll make you see  
To make you smile, I’ll let the whole world know that I  

[Chorus: Ivo Mozart]  
I’ll chase more than a million fireflies out there  
To see you smile, I can paint the sky another color  
I just want to love you  
And when the dawn breaks, I want to wake up  
By your side  

[Verse 2: Tomim]  
To have your smile, I discover Paradise  
Just seeing your lips, I lose my mind completely  
True feelings, just you and me  
To the sound of Janelle Monáe, come, let it be  
And hold me tight, time stands still when you’re near  
Take my hand and come with me, I see how right I am here  
I say I love you, you ask for something impossible:  
“Get out of bed today, the sky is incredible”  

[Chorus: Ivo Mozart]  
I’ll chase more than a million fireflies out there  
To see you smile, I can paint the sky another color  
I just want to love you  
And when the dawn breaks, I want to wake up  
By your side  

[Bridge: Ivo Mozart]  
I make your arms a safer place  
I searched for peace in another embrace, I didn’t find it, I swear  
I step out of rhythm, face troubles, whatever comes  
I open the window so you can see  

[Chorus: Ivo Mozart]  
I’ll chase more than a million fireflies out there  
To see you smile, I can paint the sky another color  
I just want to love you  
And when the dawn breaks, I want to wake up  
By your side
