**Translated Lyrics:**

It was intense, it was real  
But sincere  
I know I was capable  
I even did too much  
I wanted you in your way  
I loved you, I showed you  
That my love was the deepest  
I gave myself, I surrendered  
I was faithful, I cried, I cried  

Today I woke up, and I felt the absence of you  
Missing you, missing you  
I remembered how you used to wake me up in the morning just to say  
Good morning, my baby!  
I love you, my baby!  

Today I woke up, and I felt the absence of you  
Missing you, missing you  
I remembered how you used to wake me up in the morning just to say  
Good morning, my baby!  
I love you, my baby!  

It was beautiful, it was  
It was intense, it was real  
But sincere  
I know I was capable  
I even did too much  
I wanted you in your way  
I loved you, I showed you  
That my love was the deepest  
I gave myself, I surrendered  
I was faithful, I cried, I cried  

Today I woke up, and I felt the absence of you  
Missing you, missing you  
I remembered how you used to wake me up in the morning just to say  
Good morning, my baby!  
I love you, my baby!  

Today I woke up, and I felt the absence of you  
Missing you, missing you  
I remembered how you used to wake me up in the morning just to say  
Good morning, my baby!  
I love you, my baby!  

Today I woke up, and I felt the absence of you  
Missing you, missing you  
I remembered how you used to wake me up in the morning just to say  
Good morning, my baby!  
I love you, my baby!  

Today I woke up, and I felt the absence of you  
Missing you, missing you  
I remembered how you used to wake me up in the morning just to say  
Good morning, my baby!  
I love you, my baby!
