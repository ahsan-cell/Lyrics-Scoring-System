**Translated Lyrics:**

Tell me what happened  
It was supposed to be different  
Just us, without pain and at peace  
It was good, it made me deserve it  
Ah, how I miss us  
Time, go back

**[Chorus]**  
If you want to know, if you want to know  
The solution beats right here inside my chest  
Where all the vastness of love resides  
If you want to know, we can still be very happy  
Another day was born and I saw that...

**[Chorus]**  
The dawn has come  
Without you, life is so dull  
Without you, life is so dull  
And my heart has already realized  
And doesn’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
If it’s without you

**[Verse]**  
Tell me what happened  
It was supposed to be different  
Just us, without pain and at peace  
It was good, it made me deserve it  
Ah, how I miss us  
Time, go back

**[Chorus]**  
If you want to know, if you want to know  
The solution beats right here inside my chest  
Where all the vastness of love resides  
If you want to know, we can still be very happy  
Another day was born and I saw that...

**[Chorus]**  
The dawn has come  
Without you, life is so dull  
Without you, life is so dull  
And my heart has already realized  
And doesn’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
If it’s without you  
The dawn has come  
Without you, life is so dull  
Without you, life is so dull  
And my heart has already realized  
And doesn’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
If it’s without you  
The dawn has come  
Without you, life is so dull  
Without you, life is so dull  
And my heart has already realized  
And doesn’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
I don’t want to know anything more  
If it’s without you
