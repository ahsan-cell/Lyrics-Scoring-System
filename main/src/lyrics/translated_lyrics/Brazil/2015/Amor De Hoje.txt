**Translated Lyrics:**

But what am I supposed to do  
If getting married is a problem  
We need to sort it out  
I get home early in the morning  
To relax with the family  
And I ask my daughter  
"Sweetheart, where's your mom?"

She says that mom went out  
Last night when dad left  
And until now this morning, mom hasn't returned  
I know it's not the first time  
Not the second or the third time  
I couldn't take it anymore  
I almost poisoned myself

If I sleep out, you sleep out  
What does that mean?  
If I have dinner out, you have dinner out  
What for?  
If I go out drinking, you go too  
Is it a challenge or what?  
Are we competing or what?  
Are you lying to me?  
Are you lying to me?

I prefer to get a divorce  
Because here there’s no marriage left  
It's not worth deceiving me  
Because you no longer have feelings  
I don’t want to embarrass you  
In front of our beloved daughter  
It's better to stay quiet  
For me, you have nothing to say

She says that mom went out last night  
When dad left  
And until now this morning, mom hasn't returned  
I know it's not the first time  
Not the second or the third time  
I couldn't take it anymore  
I almost took my own life

If I sleep out, you sleep out  
What does that mean?  
If I have dinner out, you have dinner out  
What for?  
If I go out drinking, you go too  
Is it a challenge or what?  
Are we competing or what?  
Are you lying to me?

If I sleep out, you sleep out  
What does that mean?  
If I have dinner out, you have dinner out  
What for?  
If I go out drinking, you go too  
Is it a challenge or what?  
Are we competing or what?  
Are you lying to me?  
You're going to regret it, you're going to regret it.
