**Translated Lyrics:**

I saw your smile in my dream  
I followed your trail in the desert sand  
I heard your voice in the wind  
I felt your scent getting closer to me each time  

I became a madman, somewhat obsessed  
To find you somewhere in this world  
And even without ever having touched you  
You belonged to me, deep down  

Signs showed me the way to you  
Fireflies guide me without realizing  
And at the end of the road, a light seems to be you  

Signs helped me realize that my path is you  
And no one in the world will make me feel this way again  

Signs, coming from a place so far sometimes hide  
In the lighthouse on an island, on such an empty night, I kissed you  
Until dawn
