**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
You sound sleepy  
Sorry if I woke you up  
Hang up and go back to sleep  
Then call me here later  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t even know what I’d do this winter  
Anything that wasn’t with you would bore me  
I could be in space right now in a lunar module, oh how dull  
And if I were sailing on a little boat in the Caribbean, God forbid  
I could be in a five-star hotel in Dubai right now  
But I, I, I  

[Chorus]  
I’d rather be here bothering you  
Sunday morning  
It’s just that I prefer to hear  
Your sleepy voice  
Sunday morning  
Sunday morning  

[Verse]  
You sound sleepy  
Sorry if I woke you up  
Hang up and go back to sleep  
Then call me here later  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t even know what I’d do this winter  
Anything that wasn’t with you would bore me  
I could be in space right now in a lunar module, oh how dull  
And if I were sailing on a little boat in the Caribbean, God forbid  
I could be in a five-star hotel in Dubai right now  
But I, I, I  

[Chorus]  
I’d rather be here bothering you  
Sunday morning  
It’s just that I prefer to hear  
Your sleepy voice  
Sunday morning  
On a Sunday morning  
I’d rather be here bothering you  
Sunday morning  
It’s just that I prefer to hear  
Your sleepy voice  
Sunday morning  
On a Sunday morning  
Sunday morning  

[Outro]  
You sound sleepy  
You sound sleepy  
Sorry if I woke you up
