**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Today, it's today, it's today, it's today  

[Verse]  
Today I have a proposal  
Let’s get tangled up  
And lose ourselves all night long  
Today I know you like it  
So come here, get close  
Because that way you drive me crazy  
And do it like this  
In a way that leaves me wanting more  
Endlessly  
Don't say a word, just come because I'm in the mood  
I intend to have you for myself  
Just for me  

[Chorus]  
And today you won't escape  
Today, come on, our party is today  
I want to grab you again  
Today no one sleeps at home  
Today you'll be my toy  
Today because I want to enjoy you  
Today you won't escape  
Today, come on, our party is today  
I want to grab you again  
Today no one sleeps at home  
Today you'll be my toy  
Today because I want to enjoy you  

[Bridge]  
Today, it's today, it's today  
I want to grab you again  
Today, it's today, it's today  
I want to enjoy you  

[Verse]  
Today I have a proposal  
Let’s get tangled up  
And lose ourselves all night long  
Today I know you like it  
So come here, get close  
Because that way you drive me crazy  
And do it like this  
In a way that leaves me wanting more  
Endlessly  
Don't say a word, just come because I'm in the mood  
I intend to have you for myself  
Just for me  
Just for me  

[Chorus]  
And today you won't escape  
Today, come on, our party is today  
I want to grab you again  
Today no one sleeps at home  
Today you'll be my toy  
Today I want to enjoy you  
Today you won't escape  
Today, come on, our party is today  
I want to grab you again  
Today no one sleeps at home  
Today you'll be my toy  
Today because I want to enjoy you  

[Outro]  
Today, it's today, it's today  
I want to enjoy you  
Today, it's today, it's today  
I want to grab you again
