**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Thank you so much, Mamute, for the support!  
Thank you so much, Revelação family!  
Everything's ours, let the samba flow!

[Pre-Chorus]  
All I did was fall for you  
All I wanted was just to know you  
But love caught me when I saw  
Your smile, your smile  

I don’t know if I’m the one for you  
I’ve never been a saint, it’s just my way  
But love caught me when I saw  
Your smile, your smile  

[Chorus]  
I’ll do whatever it takes, I can change  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  
I am who I am, but I can’t deny  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  

I’ll do whatever it takes, I can change  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  
I am who I am, but I can’t deny  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  

[Bridge]  
The fifth secret!  
Let’s go, Mamute!  
Here we go!  
Let’s go!

[Pre-Chorus]  
All I did was fall for you  
All I wanted was just to know you  
But love caught me when I saw  
Your smile, your smile  

I don’t know if I’m the one for you  
I’ve never been a saint, it’s just my way  
But love caught me when I saw  
Your smile, your smile  

[Chorus]  
I’ll do whatever it takes, I can change  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  
I am who I am, but I can’t deny  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  

I’ll do whatever it takes, I can change  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you (I was born to love you)  
I am who I am, but I can’t deny (I can’t deny)  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you  

[Outro]  
I was born to love you, I was born to love you
