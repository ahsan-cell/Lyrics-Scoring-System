**Translated Lyrics:**

My Brazilian Brazil  
My mulatto charmer  
I will sing to you in my verses  

Brazil, samba that flows  
Swaying, making me dance  
Oh Brazil, of my love  
Land of Our Lord  

Brazil! Brazil!  

Oooooooo!  
Let the troubadour sing again  
The melancholic light of the moon  
Every song of my love  

I want to see this lady walking  
Through the halls, dragging  
Her lace dress  

Brazil!  
(For me, for me, for me)  

Brazil!  

Oh, this coconut tree that bears fruit  
Where I tie my hammock  
On clear moonlit nights  

Ah, this beautiful and dusky Brazil  
Is my Brazilian Brazil  
Land of samba and pandeiro  

Brazil!  
This coconut tree that bears fruit  
Where I tie my hammock  
On clear moonlit nights  

This beautiful and dusky Brazil  
Is my Brazilian Brazil  
Land of samba and pandeiro  

Brazil! Brazil! Brazil!  
For me, Brazil, Brazil
