[Verse 1]  
I have no regrets about the days  
No matter how far you are from me  
I have no regrets about the days  
They spoke, I’m in you and you’re in me  

[Before the Chorus]  
Ah yeah, ah yeah  
The wound must heal with medicine  
Ah yeah, ah yeah  
The night should be beautiful, oh my love  
La la la la la  

[Chorus]  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la  

[Verse 2]  
A secret message came to me  
Telling me about what’s in me  
And he said, "You and I,  
She is just a Christian."  

[Before the Chorus]  
Ah yeah, ah yeah  
The wound must heal with medicine  
Ah yeah, ah yeah  
The night should be beautiful, oh my love  
La la la la la  

[Chorus]  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la  

[Verse 3]  
This is a night and a thousand nights  
We will love for all our lives  
This is a night and a thousand nights  
We will love, dance  
It's la-la-la, it's life  

[Chorus]  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la (yeah)  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
That's life, la la la la la  
We will love, we will dance  
Yes, that's life, la la la la la
