**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Let's go

[Verse 1]  
Raise your hand in the air, and let your feet drag  
Hand on your waist, I want to see you dance  
Everyone is singing (Hey-oh), hearts racing (Hey-oh)  
Dancing and shaking without stopping

[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the sun rises, joy will arrive  
Everyone will dance  
Life will shine when love conquers you  
Oh, in the samba of Brazil

[Chorus]  
It's tropical, samba of Brazil  
Sensational, samba of Brazil  
It's global, samba of Brazil  
Phenomenal, samba of Brazil

[Verse 2]  
Join the movement, everyone, let's go wild  
Letâ€™s enjoy this vibe, no one can deny  
Everyone is singing (Hey-oh), everyone is jumping (Hey-oh)  
Dancing and shaking without stopping

[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the sun rises, joy will arrive  
Everyone will dance  
Life will shine when love conquers you  
Oh, in the samba of Brazil

[Chorus]  
It's tropical, samba of Brazil  
Sensational, samba of Brazil  
It's global, samba of Brazil  
Phenomenal, samba of Brazil

[Bridge]  
Brazil, Brazil, Brazil

[Chorus]  
It's tropical, samba of Brazil  
Sensational, samba of Brazil  
It's global, samba of Brazil  
Phenomenal, samba of Brazil  
It's tropical, samba of Brazil  
Sensational, samba of Brazil  
It's global, samba of Brazil  
Phenomenal, samba of Brazil

[Outro]  
Phenomenal, samba of Brazil
