**Translated Lyrics:**

Get your flag all around the world  
Coming out from everywhere  
Everybody together, anywhere  

'Cause we all belong to peace and love  
I'm calling you, come on! You're not alone  
Play for freedom, change the season  
Every nation, one shared reason  

Go, goal! Shake, jump and sing  
Go, goal! Move it, jump and shout  
Go, goal! Spin, leap and sing  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm  

Go, goal! Shake, jump and sing  
Go, goal! Move it, jump and shout  
Go, goal! Spin, leap and sing  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm  

Feel this festive vibe  
In every corner of Brazil, our fans await you  
Our song is like this  
From north to south of the country  
Colorful flags, everyone fits right here  
Come enjoy this warmth  
Football in one color, all in the same tune  
Hands up, emotions that spread  
Come feel this energy  

Go, goal! Shake, jump and sing  
Go, goal! Move it, jump and shout  
Go, goal! Spin, leap and sing  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm  

Go, goal! Shake, jump and sing  
Go, goal! Move it, jump and shout  
Go, goal! Spin, leap and sing  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm  

World Cup football  
Feel this energy  
All in one rhythm  
Dig for freedom  

World Cup football  
Feel this energy  
All in one rhythm  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm  

Come, bring peace and love in your heart  
No matter how, no matter where  
Freedom in the heart  
Everyone shares one passion  

Go, goal! Shake, jump and sing  
Go, goal! Move it, jump and shout  
Go, goal! Spin, leap and sing  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm  

Go, goal! Shake, jump and sing  
Go, goal! Move it, jump and shout  
Go, goal! Spin, leap and sing  
Dig for freedom  
All in one rhythm
