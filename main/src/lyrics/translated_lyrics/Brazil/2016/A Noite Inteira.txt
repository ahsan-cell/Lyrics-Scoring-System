**Translated Lyrics:**

She wants to have fun, she wants to kiss, wants to enjoy, wants to mess around  
All night long she’s going to dance, wants to have fun, she  
Will move, wants to have fun, she will kiss, wants to have fun  
Wants to mess around all night long  
She moves up and down, she moves side to side  
Just look at the way she moves, it drives me wild  
Full of curves, standing still, she's tough  
When she’s on the dance floor, you can bet no one can hold her back  
She dances, she moves, she dances, she moves  
She dances, she moves, she wants to shake it  
She wants to dance, wants to have fun, she wants to move  
Wants to have fun, she wants to kiss, wants to have fun, wants to mess around  
All night long she’s going to dance, wants to have fun, she  
Will move, wants to have fun, she will kiss, wants to have fun  
Wants to mess around all night long  
She moves up and down, she moves side to side  
Just look at the way she moves, it drives me wild  
Full of curves, standing still, she's tough  
When she’s on the dance floor, you can bet no one can hold her back  
She dances, she moves, she dances, she moves  
She dances, she moves, she wants to shake it  
She moves up and down, she moves side to side  
Just look at the way she moves, it drives me wild  
Full of curves, standing still, she's tough  
When she’s on the dance floor, you can bet no one can hold her back
