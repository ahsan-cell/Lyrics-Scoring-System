**3. Makalister, BK, Menestrel, Djonga, Sant & JXNV$, "Poetas no Topo"**  
In a year full of cyphers, even being released at the last minute, “Poetas no Topo” was one of the most remarkable tracks of 2016. Pineapple Supply and Brainstorm Studio brought together some of the most original and promising MCs that emerged in recent years. With a smooth production by Slim Beats, the MCs come in like this: Makalister full of artistic references, BK showing why he was the MC of the year, Menestrel with complex lyrics making analogies about relationships, Djonga scaring his idols with bold rhymes, Sant just talking nonsense, and JXNV$ arriving calm. Without a doubt, a moment that demonstrated 2016 was full of good surprises. – kray

**2. ADL featuring Froid, Sant & Raillow, “Favela Vive (Cypher)”**  
The group ADL proposed their own cyphers with 'Favela Vive'. DK and Lord, members of the group, teamed up with Sant, Raillow (PrimeiraMente), and Froid to talk about the favela, social awareness, and representation, generating excitement and praise. After all, great promises showed they were technical and sharp, aided by the prominent production format. Memes popped up, and little did they know part two was coming... - Igor França

**1. ADL featuring MV Bill, BK & Funkero, “Favela Viver 2 (Cypher)”**  
Since it was announced, "Favela Vive 2 (Cypher)" was a highly anticipated track, as it would be a true meeting of generations. And the wait was worth it. With a well-produced video and enviable production from Índio, the MCs came in without scruples in their rhymes. DK and Lord, the duo AlémDaLoucura, arrived full of emotion in their lines, vividly narrating the injustices they live in the Favela. BK crowns his year with some memorable lines - "Crime calls you, boy, don’t give in completely, deny it completely/Don’t be dumb like my father, didn’t see the smartest thing he did" - and a delivery only he knows how to do. Funkero talks about the pain and sadness that plague daily life in the favela. And finally, MV Bill, the veteran, steals the scene with memes ("Favela fife") and an enviable flow. Indeed, the favela lives on, and so does rap. - kray

**NATIONAL RAP HIT**  
**3. Cacife Clandestino, “Só Vitória”**  
One thing is certain, the Carioca duo Cacife Clandestino has been an example when it comes to hits. From their participation in “Sol” by Família Mada, which reached almost 20 million views and continues to be played at various parties three years after its release, to “Fuga,” which in less than two months of release already hit 3 million views, Felp and Terror have proven they know the formula for success.  
Not content with this ease in making popular sounds, in “Só Vitória,” the duo called upon producer and DJ NeoBeats from the group Cortesia Da Casa to be part of the hit's production. This specialty, by the way, has shown to be very effective in the past year, with several successful releases – unsurprisingly, some made it to our voting list – with the Class A group.  
Combining these two factors with that well-known narration of a night full of revelry, “Só Vitória” certainly wouldn’t go unnoticed. - RickMarley

**2. Haikaiss, “A Praga”**  
“It’s serious to break the vibe!” Grounded in trap, Haikaiss's new musical venture bets on the genre that is trending in the rap scene. United with the already great popularity of the São Paulo group, the success was instantaneous. Everything only generates more expectation for the group's new work, Teto Baixo, which should be released in 2017. If the year was difficult, the rappers dealt with the crisis, being the chemists they are, and formulated another success that should pave the way for greater triumphs. - Igor França

**1. Costa Gold featuring Luccas Carlos & Marechal, “Quem Tava Lá”**  
Although, at the time it was chosen for the Genius Brasil Awards, it had fewer views on YouTube than the second place (30 thousand against 27 thousand), "Quem Tava Lá?" was indeed a hit, counting with more monthly accesses than "
