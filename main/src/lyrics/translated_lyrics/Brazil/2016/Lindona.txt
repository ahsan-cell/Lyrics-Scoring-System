**Translated Lyrics:**

When she dances, she captivates me  
Arriving at the party, full of flair  
Her moves are stunning, she's a real beauty  

But what girl is this, so unique?  
That even a hundred bucks can't sway her mind  
I walked into the scene, radiating abundance  
She was on point, keeping her stance  
Immediately I invited her out  
Already imagining she could be my spouse  
So beautiful, she mesmerizes me  
What does she have that everyone desires?  

She doesn’t care, doesn’t mind the show-off  
She wants to drop it low, shake it to the ground  
She drives me wild, without giving me a chance  
The way she dances leaves me in a trance  

When she dances, she captivates me  
When she dances, she captivates me  
Arriving at the party, full of flair  
Her moves are stunning, she's a real beauty
