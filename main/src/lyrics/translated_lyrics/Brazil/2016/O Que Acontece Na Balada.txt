**Translated Lyrics:**

What happens at the party  
Stays at the party  

Did anyone see me here?  
No!  
I didn’t see anyone either  
I was at home  
And went to sleep missing my love  

What happens at the party  
Stays at the party  
The crew knows what's up  
And no one can say a thing  
Or else it all comes crashing down for everyone  
Ooooo  

Everyone's in my hands  
I’m in everyone’s hands  
It’s packed, it’s wild  
To top it off, the party’s open bar  
And there are singles  
And there are taken ones  
Decided and unloved  
There are the prepared ones  
And the ones who aren’t worth a thing  

Did anyone see me here?  
No!  
I didn’t see anyone either  
I was at home  
And went to sleep missing my love
