**Translated Lyrics:**

The guy full of charm  
For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  

For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  
For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  
We who hustle, we who grind, we who make their lives tough  
For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  
For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  
Confident and well-groomed, a delight for them  
For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  
For mom, he's the best, for the ladies, their king  
These boys are famous in the neighborhoods
