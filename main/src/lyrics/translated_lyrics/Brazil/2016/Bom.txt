**Translated Lyrics:**

Hmm, hmm, hmm, it’s good, it’s good  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, it’s good, it’s good  

**[Chorus]**  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good, good, good  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good  

**[Verse 1]**  
Relax, I want you  
Relax, I want pleasure  
Relax, the night promises and naturally it will happen  
I’m getting crazy, feeling all tingly  
I want to grab you in a nice way  
Make you lose your mind like that  
Good, good, good, good, good  

**[Chorus]**  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good, good, good  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good, good, good  

**[Bridge]**  
I’m full of mischief  
First, I’ll tease you, then I’ll devour you  
To leave you wanting more  
I want to provoke you, but oh  

**[Verse 2]**  
Relax, I want you  
Relax, I want pleasure  
Relax, the night promises and naturally it will happen  
I’m getting crazy, feeling all tingly  
I want to grab you in a nice way  
Make you lose your mind like that  
Good, good, good, good, good  

**[Chorus]**  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good, good, good  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good, good, good  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick, my lipstick  
A glass of Chandon (good)  
Warmth under the covers (good)  
You taking off my lipstick is good, good, good, good, good  

**[Outro]**  
Hmm, hmm, hmm, it’s good, it’s good  
A glass of Chandon, take off my lipstick, you’ll see it’s good, it’s good  
A glass of Chandon, take off my lipstick, you’ll see it’s good, it’s good
