**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Let him cry, let him cry, let him suffer  
Let him know that I'm truly enjoying myself  
Let him cry, let him suffer, let him know  
Let him cry, let him cry, let him suffer  
Let him know that I'm truly enjoying myself  
Let him cry, let him suffer, let him know  

[Verse]  
I said to me he’s no king  
Everything I could say, I said  
It won’t stay like this, if it’s up to me  
He’s going to lose his mind  
He can beg for my pleasure  
But I won’t regret it  
I’m not that easy, it’s over for me  
He told everyone he doesn’t want me anymore  
That love and commitment don’t satisfy you  
Now like a fool, he comes running back  
Go away, leave me in peace  
Now get ready, you’re going to find me  
Out at night, in the clubs, anywhere  
With the right person, ready to love me, to love me  

[Chorus]  
Let him cry, let him cry, let him suffer  
Let him know that I'm truly enjoying myself  
Let him cry, let him suffer, let him know  
Let him cry, let him cry, let him suffer  
Let him know that I'm truly enjoying myself  
Let him cry, let him suffer, let him know  

[Verse]  
I said to me he’s no king  
Everything I could say, I said  
It won’t stay like this, if it’s up to me  
He’s going to lose his mind  
He can beg for my pleasure  
But I won’t regret it  
I’m not that easy, it’s over for me, so...  
He told everyone he doesn’t want me anymore  
That love and commitment don’t satisfy you  
Now like a fool, he comes running back  
Go away, leave me in peace  
Now get ready, you’re going to find me  
Out at night, in the clubs, anywhere  
With the right person, ready to love me, to love me  

[Chorus]  
Let him cry, let him cry, let him suffer  
Let him know that I'm truly enjoying myself  
Let him cry, let him suffer, let him know  
Let him cry, let him cry, let him suffer  
Let him know that I'm truly enjoying myself  
Let him cry, let him suffer, let him know  

[Outro]  
Let him suffer, let him know
