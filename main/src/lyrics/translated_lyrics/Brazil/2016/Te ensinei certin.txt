**Translated Lyrics:**

I taught you right  
I taught you right  
Today you’re showing off  
Because I taught you right  

I taught you right  
I taught you right  
Today you’re showing off  
Because I taught you right  

[Verse]  
Look at me properly  
Hold me gently  
And I’ll like it  
Kiss me without fear  
With calm and desire  
And I’ll fall for you  
Be a gentleman  
Think of me first  
Or you’ll scare me away  
Don’t call me to bed  
Invite me to a party  
Maybe a dinner  
Don’t be in a rush  
Fit me in beside you  
Let me slide away  
This dance is lovely  
Take me, spin me  
Make me shine  
Be daring  
But not a creep  
Make me believe  
That you’re perfect  
A good man  
To date me  

[Chorus]  
I taught you right  
I taught you right  
Today you’re showing off  
Because I taught you right  

I taught you right  
I taught you right  
Today you’re showing off  
Because I taught you right  

[Verse]  
Look at me properly  
Hold me gently  
And I’ll like it  
Kiss me without fear  
With calm and desire  
And I’ll fall for you  
Be a gentleman  
Think of me first  
Or you’ll scare me away  
Don’t call me to bed  
Invite me to a party  
Maybe a dinner  
Don’t be in a rush  
Fit me in beside you  
Let me slide away  
This dance is lovely  
Take me, spin me  
Make me shine  
Be daring  
But not a creep  
Make me believe  
That you’re perfect  
A good man  
To date me  

[Chorus]  
I taught you right  
I taught you right  
Today you’re showing off  
Because I taught you right  

I taught you right  
I taught you right  
Today you’re showing off  
Because I taught you right
