**[Intro]**  
Oh, I'm coming in!  
Oh, what’s this now?  
Oh, crazy stuff, huh?  
Oh, I'm coming in!  
Oh, what’s this now?  
Oh, crazy stuff, huh?  

**[Verse]**  
The chemistry is wild, it's paranormal  
From beyond, from beyond  
I decipher your body without a manual  
Come on, come on  
I called you, but the phone went to voicemail  
But I haven't forgotten  
I was shaken by your look, wow!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You tell me no  
But I’ll prove you yes  
You doubt if it’s good  
And I’ll show you in the end  
I know that you want me  
Girl, I feel it in the air  
But you won’t accept it  
Without hesitating first, so...  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, I'm coming in!  
Oh, what’s this now?  
Oh, crazy stuff, huh?  
But just as a punishment, you’ll fall in love!  
I'm coming in!  
Oh, what’s this now?  
Oh, crazy stuff, huh?  
But just as a punishment, you’ll fall in love!  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
You move and stir me up  
You love the danger of provoking me  
You move and stir me up  
But just as a punishment, girl, you’ll fall in love  
You move and stir me up  
You love the danger of provoking me  
You move and stir me up  
But just as a punishment, girl, you’ll fall in love
