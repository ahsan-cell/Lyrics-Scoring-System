**Translated Lyrics:**

Hey there, Lud?  
Now it’s just the two of us  
Better this way, right?  
So come on!

[Chorus: Ludmilla]  
Better this way  
Come stay close to me  
You don’t know how much I want you  
I’ll keep you relaxed  
Since I saw you  
You injected adrenaline in me  
With you, I felt like running away (So come on, oh...)  
You caused quite a stir (Like this...)

[Verse: Biel]  
Especially with me, whose heart was racing  
Carefree, wild, without a girl chasing  
Even as a kid, I dated five girls in school  
And you took my heart and carried it off in a bag  
I’m trying to remember where I fell in love  
Was it in that smile? (I don’t know)  
Was it in that gaze? (Maybe)  
It doesn’t matter when it was, what matters is that...

[Pre-Chorus: Ludmilla]  
I wake up in the morning and make you coffee  
It feels so good to be with you and feel like a woman  
Because when we’re together, there’s no time or place  
So come love me (So come on, come on)  
I wish you knew, but I don’t know how to say  
The best version of me is when I’m with you  
So stick to my body and come warm me up

[Chorus: Ludmilla]  
Better this way (Better this way)  
Come stay close to me (Close to me)  
You don’t know how much I want you  
I’ll keep you relaxed (So relaxed)  
Since I saw you  
You injected adrenaline in me  
With you, I felt like running away (So come on, come on)  
You caused quite a stir

[Verse: Biel]  
Especially with me, whose heart was racing  
Carefree, wild, without a girl chasing  
Even as a kid, I dated five girls in school  
And you took my heart and carried it off in a bag  
I’m trying to remember where I fell in love  
Was it in that smile? (I don’t know)  
Was it in that gaze? (Maybe)  
It doesn’t matter when it was, what matters is that... (come)

[Pre-Chorus: Ludmilla]  
I wake up in the morning and make you coffee  
It feels so good to be with you and feel like a woman (So come with me)  
Because when we’re together, there’s no time or place  
So come love me (Come love me, come, come love me)  
I wish you knew, but I don’t know how to say  
The best version of me is when I’m with you (Me too)  
So stick to my body and come warm me up (Stick to me, come, stick to me)

[Bridge: Ludmilla (Biel)]  
I wake up in the morning and make you coffee  
It feels so good to be with you and feel like a woman  
(I’ll make you a woman, I’ll make you a woman)  
(So come love me, come, so come love me)  
I wish you knew, but I don’t know how to say  
(The best version of me is when I’m with you)  
(So stick to my body and come, come here, come)  
Come warm me up

[Outro: Biel (Ludmilla)]  
(Better this way)  
Much better this way, for you and for me, much better  
Much better this way, for you and for me, much better
