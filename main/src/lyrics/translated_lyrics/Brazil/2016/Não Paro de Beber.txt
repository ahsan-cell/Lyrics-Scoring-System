**Translated Lyrics:**

Today the ground will shake  
Today we have Gusttavo Lima, baby  

I’m in the crowd  
Waiting for you  
Today we have Gusttavo Lima, baby  

Come to complete me  
Come so we can dance  
Come, I’m longing for you  

I can’t stop looking at you  
Love is in the air  
So tell me, what’s missing?  

Your eyes, I’ve already lost myself  
Take me, hug me, and kiss me  
I fell in love when I saw you  
You turned my head around
