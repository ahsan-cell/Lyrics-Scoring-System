**Translated Lyrics:**

I don't exist without you  
Let's just admit it already  
Let’s raise our voices and say  
I'm shameless, that's true  
I'm jealous, it's true  
To me, it's not a flaw  
It's just my way of loving  
I'm bold, that's true  
I'm in love, that's true  
If you leave again  
I'll come back for you once more  

We're just complicating things  
Dating, breaking up  
And getting back together the next day  
Our love is like this  
With fights, with flaws  
A hundred percent full of energy  

It's clear you don't exist without me  
I don't exist without you  
Let's just admit it already  
Let’s raise our voices and say  
I'm shameless, that's true  
I'm jealous, it's true  
To me, it's not a flaw  
It's just my way of loving  
I'm bold, that's true  
I'm in love, that's true  
If you leave again  
I'll come back for you once more  

I'll call you, I'll beg you  
Crying for you to come back  
I'll call you, I'll beg you  
Crying for you to come back
