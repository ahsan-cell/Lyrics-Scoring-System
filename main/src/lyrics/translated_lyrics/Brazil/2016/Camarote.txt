**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
How do you still have the nerve to talk to me?  
Besides not having a heart, you lack common sense too.  
You did what you did and now you come asking to return,  
You don’t deserve even one percent of the love I gave you.  
You threw our story into a bottomless pit,  
Destroyed the dreams I once dreamed.  
Wanna know? Applause for you!  
You deserve the title of the worst woman in the world.

[Chorus]  
Now watch from the VIP section,  
Me sipping drinks, enjoying Ciroc,  
Living it up at the party, just having fun,  
And you left alone with no one in your fridge.  
Now watch from the VIP section,  
Me sipping drinks, enjoying Ciroc,  
Living it up at the party, just having fun,  
And you left alone with no one in your fridge,  
To learn that love is not a game!
