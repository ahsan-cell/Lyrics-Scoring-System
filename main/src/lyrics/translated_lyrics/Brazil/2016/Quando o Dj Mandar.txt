**Translated Lyrics:**

Girl, you drop it low, drop it low, oh drop it  
Focus on the beat  
Forget the rest, forget, forget  

You drop it, you drop it, you drop it, go  
You drop it, you drop it  

So focus like this  
Come on down for me  
Oh, shaking it in a way I've never seen  

So drop it now, take away my peace  
You're too much (drop it, oh drop it)  

But when Dennis gives the cue  
Girl, you drop it low, drop it low, oh drop it  
Focus on the beat  
Forget the rest, forget, forget  

So focus like this  
Come on down for me  
Oh, shaking it in a way I've never seen  

So drop it now, take away my peace  
You're too much (drop it, oh drop it)  

But when the DJ gives the cue  
Girl, you drop it low, drop it low, oh drop it  
Focus on the beat  
Forget the rest, forget, forget
