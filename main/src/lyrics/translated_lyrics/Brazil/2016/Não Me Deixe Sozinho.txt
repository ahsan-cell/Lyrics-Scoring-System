**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Love, I love feeling your taste so much  
And watching TV with you under my blanket  
It’s so good, love, to feel your affection  

[Verse 1]  
But don’t leave me alone, I’m a wild one  
When I lose control, I go for it and kiss on the lips  
The girls dancing is like the world is ending  
I pour out the tequila, whiskey, and the young one starts to shake it  

[Verse 2]  
I’m going to sing boldly, I throw myself into the world  
Until dawn, there’ll be wild fun and carefree love  
The party in the suite eases the stress  
I know that women are my kryptonite that weakens me  

[Chorus]  
Love, being alone is a mess  
Please try to understand me  
And I am just the way I am  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go, I’ll go  
Love, being alone is a mess  
Please try to understand me  
And I am just the way I am  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go  

[Verse 1]  
Don’t leave me alone, I’m a wild one  
When I lose control, I go for it and kiss on the lips  
The girls dancing is like the world is ending  
I pour out the tequila, whiskey, and the young one starts to shake it  

[Verse 2]  
I’m going to sing boldly, I throw myself into the world  
Until dawn, there’ll be wild fun and carefree love  
The party in the suite eases the stress  
I know that women are my kryptonite that weakens me  

[Chorus]  
Love, being alone is a mess  
Please try to understand me  
And I am just the way I am  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go, I’ll go  
Love, being alone is a mess  
Please try to understand me  
And I am just the way I am  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go  
If you give me a chance, I’ll go
