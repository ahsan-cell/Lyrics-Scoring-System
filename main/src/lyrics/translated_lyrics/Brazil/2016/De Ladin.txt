**Translated Lyrics:**

Come down to the floor, come  
Come here to dance too  
In the morning, I’ll move to the side  
Come down to the floor, come  
Come here to dance too  
Sketching with the steps (come!)  
Breaking it down on the side (come!)  
Sending out those moves  
The music can’t stop  
Sketching with the steps (come!)  
Breaking it down on the side (come!)  
Sending out those moves  
Come, come, come, come, come  
The DJ will embrace the vibe  
Break it all, let loose the groove  
It’s Dream Team breaking it down, I want to see  
Hold on tight, this party’s gonna shake  
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake  
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, oh, oh
