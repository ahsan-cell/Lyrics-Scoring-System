**Translated Lyrics:**

Put your hand on top of mine  
I’ll show you that you’re not alone  
Come on, the world is ours  
Let’s go, the world is ours  
Put your hand on top of mine  
I’ll show you that you’re not alone  
Come on, the world is ours  
Let’s go, the world is ours  

[Verse]  
Waking up to see the sunlight  
Your gaze, the bright glow of a lighthouse  
Don’t let it fade, come see  
Don’t let it fade, come see  
Even when the day turns to night  
The moonlight is also for you  
I came to invite you to see  
I came to invite you to see  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Walking, running hand in hand  
I don’t know, sitting on the sidewalk  
Just to play at living  
Time passing and we stop to see  
You are more than perfect  
Come here, and we’ll get it right  
Other than that, just hug me tight  
If someone criticizes, let it slide  

[Chorus]  
And put your hand on top of mine  
I’ll show you that you’re not alone  
Come on, the world is ours  
Let’s go, the world is ours  
Put your hand on top of mine  
I’ll show you that you’re not alone  
Come on, the world is ours  
Let’s go, the world is ours  

[Verse]  
Waking up to see the sunlight  
Your gaze, the bright glow of a lighthouse  
Don’t let it fade, come see  
Don’t let it fade, come see  
Even when the day turns to night  
The moonlight is also for you  
I came to invite you to see  
I came to invite you to see  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Walking, running hand in hand  
I don’t know, sitting on the sidewalk  
Just to play at living  
Time passing and we stop to see  
You are more than perfect  
Come here, and we’ll get it right  
Other than that, just hug me tight  
If someone criticizes, let it slide  

[Chorus]  
And put your hand on top of mine  
I’ll show you that you’re not alone  
Come on, the world is ours  
Let’s go, the world is ours  
Put your hand on top of mine  
I’ll show you that you’re not alone  
Come on, the world is ours  
Let’s go, the world is ours
