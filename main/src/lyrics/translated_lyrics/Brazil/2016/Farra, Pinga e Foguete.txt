**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Today I want a day of peace, I want calm  
To smell her scent, something I can hardly recall  
It’s all that I plan, to wake up early and work  
Take the same bus, go home to rest

[Pre-Chorus]  
But every evening the crew calls me out  
It was supposed to be just one drink, but it turned into chaos again

[Chorus]  
The lights are flashing, the jukebox is playing  
Amado Batista and the party's raging  
Going to work tomorrow? No way!  
Today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks  
The lights are flashing, the jukebox is playing  
With Bruno and Barretto and the party's raging  
Going to work tomorrow? No way!  
Today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks

[Bridge]  
Bring a cold one here, buddy  
Because today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks  

[Verse]  
Today I want a day of peace, I want calm  
To smell her scent, something I can hardly recall  
It’s all that I plan, to wake up early and work  
Take the same bus, go home to rest

[Pre-Chorus]  
But every evening the crew calls me out  
It was supposed to be just one drink, but it turned into chaos again

[Chorus]  
The lights are flashing, the jukebox is playing  
Amado Batista and the party's raging  
Going to work tomorrow? No way!  
Today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks  
The lights are flashing, the jukebox is playing  
With Bruno and Barretto and the party's raging  
Going to work tomorrow? No way!  
Today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks  
The lights are flashing, the jukebox is playing  
Amado Batista and the party's raging  
Going to work tomorrow? No way!  
Today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks  
The lights are flashing, the jukebox is playing  
With Bruno and Barretto and the party's raging  
Going to work tomorrow? No way!  
Today is just fun, drinks, and fireworks
