**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Come with a wicked desire,  
Come closer to me.  
Today, I want it, and you know  
That I like it this way.

[Post-Chorus]  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse]  
Bang (Bang), I took my shot at you (Come)  
Let me make it happen (Come)  
It has to be this way to keep up with me, to arrive,  
So come (Come), I’m not one to put on too much pressure (No)  
But I won’t be left in your hands (And)  
If you want it, you can’t hesitate, can’t take too long.

[Pre-Chorus]  
And, to take control, to turn your head,  
I’ll keep teasing you.  
And, to shock you, to turn the tables,  
I won’t stop until I see you losing it.

[Chorus]  
Come with a wicked desire,  
Come closer to me.  
Today, I want it, and you know  
That I like it this way.

[Post-Chorus]  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh
