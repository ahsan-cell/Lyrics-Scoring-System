[Intro: L7NNON & Lourena]  
Hey Malak  
Just stopping by to talk a little about love once again (Poetry 11)  
Nothing has changed  
Let’s go  

[Verse 1: L7NNON, Chris MC & both]  
Oh, you didn’t even tell me your last name so I could find you on Insta'  
I’m trying to see if someone I know knows you, huh (Someone)  
They told me it was nice to see me out there  
And that in person is better than online, huh  
She plays with the man’s demeanor  
Throws it in my face and then she disappears  
Says she can’t stand my scruffy look  
And that she didn’t believe I was at 11, huh  
The look of the brake (Of the Blazer)  
That drives her crazy, huh  
I warned you that  
I’m going to kiss your lips  
Without fear of anything, full of attitude, wonderful  
To break down your attitude, I lean in and say “Gorgeous”  
Tired of hearing from those who’ve done nothing for me  
I owe nothing to anyone, we can do whatever we want  
Like, beautiful, dance for me  
Do whatever you want  
You know I’m into you  
Are you going to tell me you don’t want?  
In the car with her beside me, I’m chill  
If she’s driving, it’s like a plane piloting the ship  
I’m jotting down lines and making noise  
Writing life and talking about everything  
While they’re talking this and that, my sound plays in every corner of the world, yeah  
I’m going to kiss your lips while taking off your clothes  
It’s impossible to want to trade you for another  

[Verse 2: Chris MC & Lourena]  
I want to feel the sensation  
Of the first time I saw you (I saw you)  
Explaining to my heart that you’re missed, it doesn’t always show  
I see you in the best dreams  
I have plans for us  
If I kiss you, I hear the sound of angels  
With your face, your voice  
I’m coming to get you, having somewhere to return, where to arrive, arrive  
You leave me breathless (Breathless)  
So there are always reasons to celebrate  
No commitments, you like that  
Love like ours is so good (So good)  
Change this record, I’m not taking risks  
You’re my best inspiration  

[Verse 3: MC Ryan SP & Chris MC]  
The measure of love is to love without measure  
That’s why I loved you so much, woman (Woman)  
I got hurt trusting in love and you taught me how it is (How it is)  
I surrendered to this illusion, I was a guinea pig in this nonsense  
I won’t fall in love again, I’ll live in the party  
For every game over, there will be a play  
You threw away all the love I gave you  
As you want, so it will be, I’m leaving and not coming back  
Shark, if she shows up at your party?  
I swear, I won’t let her in  
If she appears in the room naked?  
Ah, I’m sorry, I’ll have to avoid  
But if she calls you in the middle of the night?  
Voicemail, no point in calling  
And all the times I forgave you thinking love could thrive?  
Baby, why do you reject me? I ended up in the gutter  
Blame it on love acting all high and mighty  
Drink, forget the princess, celebrate Friday  
The richness of love is to have purity and you didn’t have it  

[Verse 4: Lourena & Chris MC]  
You promised, promised a happy ending  
But forgot, forgot, forgot about me  
If you don’t want to be deceived, want to stay at the party  
How can I trust you if you don’t stay home?  
I’m a strong woman, only you didn’t notice  
That your friends wanted closure just like I did  
But, damn, without wanting, I liked you  
I complain if I see someone else wanting you (No)  
Not that I like it that way, I just want to mess around  
Lourena who dropped the bomb  
Today I’ll make you go crazy  
What I ask, you’ll have to do  
Otherwise, I’ll say  
That I don’t love you, many complaints about you  
Why did you do this to me?  
Huh, Xamã?  

[Verse 5: Xamã & Chris MC]  
We’re together and apart, baby  
Why are we so wrong? Hum-um  
You two in a bind  
Everyone knows we have a connection
