[Intro: MC Pogba & DJ Guih da ZO]  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come (Hey, DJ Guih da ZO? You're really slacking off, huh, dog?)  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  

[Chorus: MC Pogba]  
Can't see Guih da ZO, she moves right away  
Can't see Guih da ZO, she moves right away  
She shakes it back, then forward she shows it all  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  
Forward she shows it—, forward—, forward she shows it all  
Forward she shows it—, forward—, forward she shows it all  

[Verse: MC Pogba]  
Today we pull you in and devour you, tomorrow you'll be forgotten  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  

[Interlude: MC Pogba & DJ Guih da ZO]  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come

[Chorus: MC Pogba]  
Can't see Guih da ZO, she moves right away  
Can't see Guih da ZO, she moves right away  
She shakes it back, then forward she shows it all  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  
Uh, uh, ah, ah, come, come, come, come  
Forward she shows it—, forward—, forward she shows it all  
Forward she shows it—, forward—, forward she shows it all

We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby  
We hit it hard and goodbye, we hit it hard and goodbye, baby
