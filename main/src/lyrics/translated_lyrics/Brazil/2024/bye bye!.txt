**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: El Juanes]  
Hey baby  
The beginning of our stories  

[Verse 1: El Yandel]  
You’re the only one around me  
We started this chemistry  
And this is the start of our adventure  
We’re opening a game called love  
No promises, just these emotions  
Without pain or sorrow  

[Chorus: El Yandel]  
No doubt  
This is our adventure  
Don’t expect sadness  
You’ll forget all the bad news  
In our hearts forever  
Playing now  
In the colors of this love  

[Verse 2: El Juanes]  
Yeah, baby, you’re telling me I’m a romantic  
Your beauty has me so heated  
The lights are shining in my eyes, in my eyes  
Come on, come on  
Kiss me with passion  
Realize it’s a maze called love  
And you and I can’t escape, no  
Give me the light, my rose  
My baby, give me some…  

[Chorus: El Juanes]  
No doubt  
This is our adventure  
Don’t expect sadness  
You’ll forget all the bad news  
In our hearts forever  
Playing now  
In the colors of this love  

[Pre-Chorus: El Yandel]  
It’s not painful  
That forever our love  
I want, I want  
I see your eyes and that smile  
It stayed in my heart  

[Verse 3: El Yandel]  
These nights are so cold without you  
I’m ready to hold you in my arms forever  
My baby, my words for you  
This passion that burns me  
When I see these movements  

[Chorus: El Yandel & El Juanes]  
No doubt  
This is our adventure  
Don’t expect sadness  
You’ll forget all the bad news  
In our hearts forever  
Playing now  
In the colors of this love  
No doubt  
This is our adventure  
Don’t expect sadness  
You’ll forget all the bad news  
In our hearts forever  
Playing now  
In the colors of this love  

[Outro: El Juanes & El Yandel]  
Mmm... I miss you so much, baby  
With me, you’ll forget the pain  
El Yandel, I know you miss it, princess  
El Juanes, your kisses left honey on your cheeks, babe  
Bye bye  
Do you still think of me? Ciao
