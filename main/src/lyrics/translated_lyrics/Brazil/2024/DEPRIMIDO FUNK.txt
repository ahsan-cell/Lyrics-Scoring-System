**Translated Lyrics:**

I don't want you here  
I'm fine on my own  
I don't need you here  
I'm good alone  

[Verse 1]  
Bae, I'm all alone, stuck in this zone  
I don’t want to be a clone, you’ll remember my name  
I’m a vampire, give me blood, I’m hungry  
Bae, I'm all alone, yeah  
Bae, I'm all alone, yeah  
Blood all on the floor, I can’t shake off this pain  
You want to be with me but I don’t feel love  
Money in my safe, you try to break through the hurt  
Broken heart, still you want more  

[Bridge]  
Bae, I want you  
But I don’t want to  
I know it hurts  
But I don’t care anymore  
Half-dead, I kind of like it  
Give me lean to (Give me lean) mix with the hate  

[Verse 2]  
I’m forever sad, goth boy in my B.I.  
God of darkness, give me light, I can't see  
I don’t trust anyone, you never believed in me  
I’ll run far away, forget everything I’ve seen, yeah  
You never loved me, bae, I’ll never forget  
Remembering the sins until the moment of death  
I’m so depressed, fuck it, I don’t want to care anymore  
I’m tired of crying and spending life in pain
