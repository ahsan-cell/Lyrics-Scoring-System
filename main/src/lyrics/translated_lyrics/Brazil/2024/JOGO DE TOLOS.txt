**Translated Lyrics:**

Shoutout to Vlec  
Glock in the manager, let’s get it  
My crew, they all have style  
Every night dropping some synthetics  

They all want to be like Vlec  
Their girls want to be with Vlec  
None of them dress like Vlec  
Pointing right at your face, han, QVS  

Red pills in the Matrix  
Running to another galaxy in a spaceship  
Tripling bills like the Wolf of Wall Street  
Money and power don’t come with Netflix  

“Ten bad bitches” and a Vantage coupe  
MDMA coordinating the BPM  
My girl doesn’t speak Portuguese  
By the way, “descend the dancer on the pole dance”  

Step on it, F-type, just for a pit stop  
Playing MD in a doped-up kit for hours  
Drug dealer distributing like Aaron Rodgers  
(Shhhh) Dead men don’t tell tales  
You might also like  
Never the second, bitch I’m the one!  
With this money, Chanel, Saint Laurent  
A hooker in my bed, South American  
Flashing lights, Bentley truck  

Cozy  

Hmmm...  
I’m marrying this girl, she dances for me  
Takes off her panties and hands me the gin  
Lying on a bed covered in cash  
Yeah, yeah  

I did it because it’s so easy for me  
In this game, I can do anything  
When I rhyme, everyone loves it  
I did it because it’s so easy for me  

Success is on the way, I’m not leaving here  
The boys know I only make hits  
Making beats, I’m like a magician  
I did it because it’s so easy for me  

Teeth chattering, I can’t take it anymore  
High off this green, the pressure drops  
The bell ringing, they want more  
Yah!  
Vlorde  

Latin mafia like it happened in Cali  
Here in South America, we do it this way  
500 horses plus the Ferrari logo  
I’ve already stolen the key to the city from the mayor  

Forget my college, I’m already leaving  
Party in my neighborhood, where cowards don’t show up  
Lord V singing, she never holds back  
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it  

Arthur Gadea  

I hit the scene, shoutout to Vlec  
I hit a hater who came asking for a flash  
This jerk stepped on my Air Max  
Kissed my elbow and took 25 jabs  

A gold digger came asking for my snap (chat)  
Asking if I wanted to check  
Scorpio by birth, I gave a check  
Her butt was prettier than Cozy making the track  

This girl is like a Ferrari  
Listening on the dance floor, she dances at the party  
Shaking that ass, going up and down halfway  
Hypnotizing my mind like Aladdin and Jade  
My purple drink is Fanta Grape with Campari  
To warm up a little more and feel at ease  
I speed over a thousand, passing Bugattis  
I was born knowing this, like I-lu-mi-natti  

Everyone jumping at the show  
Divide by five, a third for the hoes  
Like ADL, I have over a thousand flows  
And the favela lives on, look where we’ve come  

Turn up the bass like Flea on slap  
Always gripped, you know slatt slatt  
Almost Aquaman, I want fish in my cash  
QVS New Drip, you know, no cap!  

Vlorde  

Charging ahead like Dinho in Spain  
Foreign girls get excited when they see a Brazilian  
Using a lot of Mary, I look like Spider-Man  
I arrive setting fire, fire fire in the brothel  

She’s throwing it, throwing that big thing  
She’s throwing it, throwing that big thing  
She’s throwing it, throwing that big thing
