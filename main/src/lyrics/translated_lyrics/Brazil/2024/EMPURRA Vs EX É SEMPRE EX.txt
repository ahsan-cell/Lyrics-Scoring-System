**[Intro]**  
Push it, push it, push it, push it (Hey, DJ Kennedy? Why are you the best, my friend?)  
Push it, push it (Are you leaving the girls thirsty?)  
Push it, push it (You're bad, huh? I'm bad)  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Push-push-push it  

**[Chorus]**  
Just on the grind  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Push it, push it, push it, oh, my love  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  

**[Verse 1: MC Vuk Vuk]**  
He pushes you like this  
Daddy wants to grab you, daddy wants to grab you  
Daddy wants to grab you, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me  
Come to me, come, come, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me  

**[Verse 2: Mr Bim]**  
She said she's my ex, missing my thing  
She said she's my ex, missing my thing  
I'm going to— I'm going to send it to her, look, I'm going to send it to you, go ahead  
An ex is always an ex, missing— missing my thing  
An ex is always an ex, missing my thing  
An ex is always an ex, missing my thing  
Missing my thing, missing— missing my thing  
Missing my thing, missing, missing, missing, missing my thing  

**[Chorus]**  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Big beat, damn  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Push-push-push it  
Just on the grind  
Push it, push it, push it, push it (Hey, DJ Kennedy? Why are you the best, my friend?)  
Push it, push it (Are you leaving the girls thirsty?)  
Push it, oh, my love (You're bad, huh? I'm bad)  
Push it, push it, push it, push it  
Push it, push it, push it, push it

Daddy wants to grab you, daddy wants to grab you  
Daddy wants to grab you, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me  
Come to me, come, come, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me  
Come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come to me, come give it to me
