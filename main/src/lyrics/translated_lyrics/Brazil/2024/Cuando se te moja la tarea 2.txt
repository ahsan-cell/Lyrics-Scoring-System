**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Larin, take the umbrella, it's going to rain  
No way, it’s not even going to rain, mom  
I’m here, teacher  
Why are you wet?  
It’s just that it’s raining by my house  
But at least did you bring the homework?  
Teacher, my homework got wet  
What a coincidence that today, when we check homework, it gets wet  
To the principal's office!  
I’m going to call your mom! (When your homework gets wet)

[Verse]  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  

[Chorus]  
To the principal's office!  
I’m going to call your mom!  
Mom, mom, mom, mom  
To the principal's office!  
I’m going to call your mom!  
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom  
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom  
Mom, mom, mom, mom  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet — Office!  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet — To the principal's office!  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet — Office!  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet — To the principal's office! I’m going to call your mom!  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet  
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom  
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom  
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom  
Mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom, mom  

[Outro]  
Larin, take the umbrella, it's going to rain  
No way, it’s not even going to rain, mom (It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet)  
I’m here, teacher  
Why are you wet? (It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet)  
It’s just that it’s raining by my house (It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet)  
But at least did you bring the homework? (It gets you wet, it gets you wet, it gets you wet)  
It gets you wet, mom, it gets you wet, mom, it gets you wet, mom, it gets you wet, mom  
It gets you wet, mom, it gets you wet, mom, it gets you wet, mom, it gets you wet, wet  
It gets you — office!, it gets you — office!, it gets you — To the principal's office!, it gets you — office  
It gets you — office!, it gets you — office!, it gets you — To the principal's office!, it gets you — office  
It gets you — office!, it gets you — office!, it gets you — To the principal's office!, it gets you — office
