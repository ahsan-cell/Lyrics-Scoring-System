**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: SXID]  
This is DJ SXID, feel the contagious energy

[Chorus]  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  

(Note: The repetition in the chorus emphasizes a feeling of surrender or immersion, which is common in dance music, capturing the essence of losing oneself in the moment.)
