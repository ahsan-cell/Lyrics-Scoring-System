**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part 1: Major RD]**
It’s no use talking, you need to act  
I’m talking about grinding, doing your thing and conquering the sky with time to survive  
I saw my friends standing strong, in the best clothes and chains, just living for leisure  
Black in a black suit, cap with a straight brim, the racists had to give in  
Cruising in the Verón, Ycaro in the passenger seat  
DJ Nathan Dreadlock, crazy beats, you gotta see to believe  
I came from CG, the kids shoot at the wolf  
Gasoline and fire, radar, scraped chassis  
License plate covered, freestyle flow  
Boombap, always ready to die  
And look man, look me in the eye and face me  
I call myself Major  
Owner of the flexible flow that hits back at you, better step aside  
44 stabs, painful death, in an instant you return to dust  
This is the real deal, don’t mess with us  
We snore like a Ford engine, Brutang, Z.O  

**[Part 2: Elicê]**  
Grab the phone and feel free to call me  
I have everything you need in my bag  
Living life like a rockstar  
Smoking that green herb like Shrek  
Always talking trash  
Even if I finish perfectly  
Your hands won’t reach me  
Come on, screw A Banca  
All my homies want cash  
On the grind every week  
I want Off White and Dolce Gabbana  
Screw Matuê too  
I have a terrorist plan like Osama  
Rolling with the Bloods, bullets for the cops  
I’m filled with rage like Kurama  
Chasing cash...  
Even so, we smoke the good stuff and take some sips  
I’m always keeping my discipline  
Even with red eyes and a hazy mind  
20 in my pocket  
Thin gold around my neck  
Versace perfume on my body  
Look, those guys are back again  
Making money in the game  
See my homies at the top  
I’m a dragon breathing fire  
My crew is a mess  
The crew switches but doesn’t run  
The crew kills but doesn’t die  
We hit the scene and steal the show  
These rich kids don’t understand that we’re strong  

**[Part 3: Major RD]**  
Roger Danger  
Black Panther  
To hit these clowns who talk too much!  
Today the bullets fly  
If I do, I might not come back home  
The crew is armed  
Tell your parents!  
(scratch)  
I came to hit you  
I was there at the apartment  
I’m running like Mbappé  
It’s the Ghost of my voice  
That takes over this beat  
Oh, you bastard!  
Call me a monkey and see what happens!  
Fuck the police!  
Derek said  
Disagreeing with the crew  
Man, that’s madness!  
Major RD spits fire  
Didn’t like it? Didn’t even hear it!  
Best in the team  
We killed Wolverine  
I laugh hard since the piston wheel  
I guarantee when I sing I scare you  
This rap of yours is Walt Disney, damn!  

**[Part 4: Elicê]**  
Man, I’m living the real trap  
I’m peeing at the party, your girl looks at me  
This is drill shit, no cap  
Rolling out, I make money easy  
Contacts in the corners of Rio  
Pussy, you laughed  
And now you want to roll with the crew  
Now it’s too late  
You know you’re sent and don’t even show up  
Uh, yeah!  

Go bitch  
I speed the car while she gives me head  
Drill shit  
In the passenger seat, clapping with her ass  
I’ll crush you from Friday to Monday  
This gas has me calm like Buddha  
(scratch)  

**[Part 5: Elicê]**  
Smoking plants, the filling of my wallet  
I can feast all month on MC  
This bitch is expensive, she does expensive drugs  
She throws it in my face, so I throw milk back  
I do my hustle in Nike and Bape  
Only OGs by my side, I don’t roll with fakes  
My homies have glocks and also have Dracos  
We’re rich mouths selling these weights  
Smoking the good stuff, police on our tail  
Flying high smoking weed  
My cup has whiskey, energy drink, and drugs  
Rolling on the scene is a success with the crew  
Drag the plate at 66 degrees  
Flee is trash and fuck the police  
I have a pack hidden in my sock  
Their kid wants to live this life  
Their daughter wants us because we’re media  
Black changing lives  
Blessed with power
