**[Verse]**  
I’ll wait for you here  
But please answer the phone, even if it’s a collect call  
Today I won’t go out  
Because my car is broken  
I can’t afford to spend  
When you get here  
Just shout for me out front  
I’ll run to pick you up  
There’s no one here  
But I’ll leave the light on  

I already gave you my cell and the address  
That day when I saw you leave your house  
I know you always had my back, even said you loved me  
Now you’ve changed, graduated from college  
In my classes, I haven’t even made it halfway  
You’re so different now  
I’ll follow you, you lead the way  
I’m dying to see you  

**[Chorus]**  
I’ll wait for you  
At my humble place  
So we can make love  
But I just ask for a little patience  
The bed is broken and there’s no blanket  
I’ll wait for you  
At my humble place  
So we can make love  
But I just ask for a little patience  
The bed is broken and there’s no blanket
