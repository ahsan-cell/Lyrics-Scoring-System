**Translated Lyrics:**

That I went traveling with my friends  
Tell her I'm enjoying my freedom  
And that I'm working, everything's hectic  
Say she saw me way too happy, and that everything's beautiful  

Just don’t tell her that I lost it  
Or that I went crazy  
Don’t let her know that I’m slowly dying  
Make up any story you want  
Just don’t tell the truth  

Tell her that now I live by the beach  
That I’m living the life I asked God for  
Say that every night she sees me out partying  
Say that everyone wants to be my friend  
Tell her I found peace, and that she saw me smiling  

Just don’t tell her that I lost it  
Or that I went crazy  
Don’t let her know that I’m slowly dying  
Make up any story you want  
Just don’t tell the truth  
The truth  

I just want her to remember  
The most beautiful moments  
This suffering is mine  
And it won’t be shared, help me, friend  

Just don’t tell her that I lost it, or that I went crazy  
Don’t let her know that I’m slowly dying  
Make up any story you want  

Just don’t tell her that I lost it, or that I went crazy  
Don’t let her know that I’m slowly dying  
Make up any story you want  

Don’t tell the truth, I love her and I miss her  
That’s the pure truth  
I love her and I miss her
