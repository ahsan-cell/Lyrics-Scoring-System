**Translated Lyrics:**

Now, I’ve become sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet  
Now, I’ve become so-so-so-so-sweet, sweet  
Now, I’ve become sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet  
Now, I’ve become so-so-so-so-sweet, sweet  

Now, I’m sweet, like caramel  
I’m cruising in my yellow Camaro  
And now you say, “Come here, I want you”  
When I drive by in the yellow Camaro  

When I used to pass by you  
On my bike, you wouldn’t even look at me  
You did everything to see me, to notice me  
But you wouldn’t even glance  

Then, I got an inheritance from my old man  
And it solved my problems, my situation  
And overnight, I became rich  
I’m in style, I look good, I walk like a boss  

Now, I’m sweet, like caramel  
I’m cruising in my yellow Camaro  
And now you say, “Come here, I want you”  
When I drive by in the yellow Camaro  

And now you come around, right?  
And now you want me, right?  
But now, I’ll choose  
There are plenty of women around  
And now you come around, right?  
And now you want me  
But now, I’ll choose  
There are plenty of women around  

When I used to pass by you  
On my bike, you wouldn’t even look at me  
You did everything to see me, to notice me  
But you wouldn’t even glance  

Then, I got an inheritance from my old man  
And it solved my problems, my situation  
And overnight, I became rich  
I’m in style, I look good, I walk like a boss  

Now, I’m sweet, like caramel  
I’m cruising in my yellow Camaro  
And now you say, “Come here, I want you”  
When I drive by in the yellow Camaro  

And now you come around, right?  
And now you want me, right?  
But now, I’ll choose  
There are plenty of women around  
And now you come around  
And now you want me  
But now, I’ll choose  
There are plenty of women around  

Now, I’m sweet, like caramel  
I’m cruising in my yellow Camaro  
And now you say, “Come here, I want you”  
When I drive by in the yellow Camaro  

And now, I’ve become sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet  
And now, I’ve become so-so-so-so-sweet, sweet  
And now, I’ve become sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet  
And now, I’ve become so-so-so-so-sweet, sweet
