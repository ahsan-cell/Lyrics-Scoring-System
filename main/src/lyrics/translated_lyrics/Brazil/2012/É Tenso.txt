**Translated Lyrics:**

Kiss for real, I take for real  
And the next day, I don’t remember a thing  
It’s way too intense!

Kissing: I like it  
Drinking: I love it  
Anywhere is fine by me  
Any passion brings me joy  
There’s a party, I’m ready!  
If it’s a celebration, call me!  
I’m carefree and have no limits

The problem is I drink and cause a scene  
But then I don’t remember anything  
That’s okay, it’s no big deal  
We just blame it on the liquor

It’s my flaw, I drink for real  
Kiss for real, take for real  
And the next day, I don’t remember a thing  
It’s way too intense!

It’s my flaw, I drink for real  
Kiss for real, take for real  
And the next day, I don’t remember a thing  
It’s way too intense!

It’s my flaw, I drink for real  
Kiss for real, take for real  
And the next day, I don’t remember a thing  
It’s way too intense!  
It’s my flaw, I drink for real  
Kiss for real, take for real  
And the next day, I don’t remember a thing  
It’s way too intense!
