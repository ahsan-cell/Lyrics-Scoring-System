**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Mickael Carreira]  
I’m longing for your embrace  
For that love of yours that lifts me high  
I’m yearning for those dark eyes  
For your smile, white as snow up in the sky  
I miss that gaze that captivates  
That warm mouth that turns everything around  
I’m nostalgic for that beautiful face  
That asks me, “Stay just one more second now”

[Verse 2: Paula Fernandes]  
I’m like grass, wishing for rain  
A cold dawn, waiting for the sun  
I’m so needy like a prisoner  
Living a nightmare, kissing without passion  
I want to face the world head-on  
To be forever the guide of your heart  
I’m the half of a love that resonates  
In a poem shaped like a song

[Chorus: Paula Fernandes & Mickael Carreira, Both]  
Without you, I’m a hunter without prey  
Without you, loneliness embraces me  
Without you, I’m less than half  
I’m unable to live for myself  
Without you, I without you

[Verse 3: Paula Fernandes]  
I’m longing for your embrace  
For that love of yours that lifts me high  
I’m yearning for those dark eyes  
For your smile, white like snow  
I miss that gaze that captivates  
That warm mouth turning everything around  
I’m nostalgic for that beautiful face  
Asking me, “Stay just one more second now”

[Verse 4: Mickael Carreira]  
I’m like grass that longs for rain  
A cold dawn waiting for the sun  
I’m so needy like a prisoner  
Living a nightmare, kissing without passion  
I want to face the world head-on  
To be forever the guide of your heart  
I’m the half of a love that resonates  
In a poem shaped like a song

[Chorus: Paula Fernandes & Mickael Carreira, Both]  
Without you, I’m a hunter without prey  
Without you, loneliness embraces me  
Without you, I’m less than half  
I’m unable to live for myself  

[Chorus: Both, Paula Fernandes & Mickael Carreira]  
Without you, I’m a hunter without prey  
Without you, loneliness embraces me  
Without you, I’m less than half  
I’m unable to live for myself  

[Outro]  
Without you, without you, oh  
Without you, I without you, without you
