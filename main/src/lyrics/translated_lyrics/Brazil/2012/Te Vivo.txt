**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
When I feel alone  
I make you more present  
I close my eyes  
And see us together  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In just a few seconds  
I fly to another world  
Another constellation  
It's hard to explain  
When I see you coming  
What the feeling is  

[Chorus]  
We don’t need to be glued together to be close  
Our bodies talk for hours and hours  
Without words, we’re saying to each other all the time  
How much we adore one another  
I don’t need to look at you  
To have you in my world  
Because wherever I go  
You are in everything  
Everything, everything that I need  
I live you  

[Verse]  
When I feel alone  
I make you more present  
I close my eyes  
And see us together  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In just a few seconds  
I fly to another world  
Another constellation  
It's hard to explain  
When I see you coming  
What the feeling is  

[Chorus]  
We don’t need to be glued together to be close  
Our bodies talk for hours and hours  
Without words, we’re saying to each other all the time  
How much we adore one another  
I don’t need to look at you  
To have you in my world  
Because wherever I go  
You are in everything  
Everything, everything that I need  

[Chorus]  
We don’t need to be glued together to be close  
Our bodies talk for hours and hours  
Without words, we’re saying to each other all the time  
How much we adore one another  
I don’t need to look at you  
To have you in my world  
Because wherever I go  
You are in everything  
Everything, everything that I need  
I live you
