Here’s the English translation of the lyrics:

---

I went to try to distract myself  
Arriving at the party  
I saw you looking beautiful  

You in the VIP area  
And I spinning around the place  
Looking for a way  
To invade your space  

I have no money  
I have no fame  
I have no car  
I’m just hitching a ride  

My card  
Got blocked  
And my limit  
Is maxed out  

I’m simple  
But I promise you  
I know how to do the Lê Lê Lê  

Lê Lê Lê  
Lê Lê Lê  
If I catch you, you’ll see  

Lê Lê Lê  
Lê Lê Lê  

You will never forget me
