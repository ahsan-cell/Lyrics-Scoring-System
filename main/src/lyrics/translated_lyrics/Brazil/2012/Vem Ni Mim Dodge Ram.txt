**Translated Lyrics:**

Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!

Not long ago  
I was walking on foot, couldn’t catch a cold, let alone a girl  
Just gathering dust, no one looked my way  
One day I decided, I’m gonna get out of here

If you don’t have money, you’re like a dog’s first cousin  
The situation was so bad, there wasn’t even a bone left for me  
Now I’ve changed  
My pockets are full  
Ladies are chasing me  
I want to hear it more and more

Come to me, Dodge Ram  
Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!  
Come to me, Dodge Ram  
Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!

Not long ago that I was walking on foot  
Couldn’t catch a cold,  
Let alone a girl  
Just gathering dust  
No one looked my way  
One day I decided, I’m gonna get out of here

If you don’t have money, you’re like a dog’s first cousin  
The situation was so bad, there wasn’t even a bone left for me  
Now I’ve changed, my pockets are full  
Ladies are chasing me, I want to hear it more and more

Come to me, Dodge Ram  
Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!  
Come to me, Dodge Ram  
Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!

Come to me, Dodge Ram  
Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!  
Come to me, Dodge Ram  
Focker two eighty, the ladies are wild  
Israel Novaes is killing it!
