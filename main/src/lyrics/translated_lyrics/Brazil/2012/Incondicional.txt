**Translated Lyrics:**

I will ask the Sun to light our way  
And all the stars to adorn our fate  
Take me wherever you go, hold my hand tight  
For I know you will be my guiding light  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
That's how we are, we have so much in common  
You’ve left a mark on me, and to you, I'm not just anyone  
This is our love, as strong as the night  
Perfect like the day  

**[Chorus]**  
I will rise among the clouds to sketch your smile  
And in the blue of the sky, I’ll see your eyes shining  
And among the stars, I keep floating  
In my fingerprints, there’s already a bit of you  
I follow your signs, this way I’ll never lose you  
It’s unconditional, you have the exact way to bind me  
To you  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
That's how we are  
We have so much in common  
You’ve left a mark on me  
And to you, I'm not just anyone  
This is our love, as strong as the night  
Perfect like the day  

**[Chorus]**  
I will rise among the clouds to sketch your smile  
And in the blue of the sky, I’ll see your eyes shining  
And among the stars, I keep floating  
In my fingerprints, there’s already a bit of you  
I follow your signs, this way I’ll never lose you  
It’s unconditional, you have the exact way to bind me  
To you  

**[Chorus]**  
I will rise among the clouds to sketch your smile  
And in the blue of the sky, I’ll see your eyes shining  
And among the stars, I keep floating  
In my fingerprints, there’s already a bit of you  
I follow your signs, this way I’ll never lose you  
It’s unconditional, you have the exact way to bind me  
To you  

**[Outro: Chorus and Luan Santana]**  
(In my fingerprints, there’s already a bit of you)  
(I follow your signs)  
This way I’ll never lose you  
(It’s unconditional, you have the exact way)  
To bind me  
To you
