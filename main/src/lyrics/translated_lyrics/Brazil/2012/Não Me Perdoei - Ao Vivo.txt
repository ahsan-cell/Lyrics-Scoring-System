**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Leo]  
I wanted to be an angel  
But I’m nothing more than what I am  
I would give you a pair of stars  
And all I have is my love  

[Verse 2: Leo, Both]  
I only know how to dream of you  
Accepting my return  
I’m afraid of losing you  
I love you, I confess  

[Chorus: Leo, Both]  
Where are your eyes  
When they’re not on me?  
Where are your steps  
If we haven’t reached the end?  
I would go back to where I left you  
I didn’t want you to cry, I cried  
I wanted you to forgive me  
I haven’t forgiven myself  

[Interlude: Victor]  
Êh-êh-êh-êh-êh-êh
