**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Hello, Batidão Stronda! Hello, DG! This one’s a hit, huh, bro? You guys are a mess, huh? Haha, let’s go, bro!

[Verse]  
Today she’s a sight, so bold and brash  
Mocking all the jealous ones with a laugh  
And if you move, you’ll get what’s coming, don’t even try to copy  
She’s the queen of the scene when it’s time to sway

[Chorus]  
Drop it low in rhythm, bounce to the beat  
Move it down in rhythm, it’s such a sweet heat  
Move it down in rhythm, bounce to the beat  
It’s such a sweet heat  
So smooth, so sweet, it’s such a sweet heat  
So smooth, so sweet, it’s such a sweet heat  
So smooth, so sweet, it’s such a sweet heat  
So smooth, so smooth  

So drop it low in rhythm, bounce to the beat  
Move it down in rhythm, it’s such a sweet heat  
Move it down in rhythm, bounce to the beat  

[Outro]  
Hello, Batidão Stronda  
Hello, BJ  
This one’s a hit, right bro?  
You guys are a mess, huh?  
Let’s go, bro!
