**"Myths and Realities about Suicide"**

"Myth: Those who want to commit suicide donâ€™t give warnings.
Reality: Out of ten people who commit suicide, eight give hints about their intentions, even if minimal. Suicide is often the result of a process that can usually be monitored, although it may unfold very quickly in young people.

Myth: A suicidal person really wants to die.
Reality: The suicidal person wishes to stop suffering; they donâ€™t truly want to die. They hesitate between life and death, leaving it to others to save them.

Myth: Suicidal individuals are either cowards or brave.
Reality: A suicidal person does not act against their life out of cowardice or bravery, but because their life is unbearable and they see no other solution.

Myth: Once a person attempts suicide, they will always be suicidal.
Reality: The tendency towards suicide is reversible. This process does not last a lifetime and can be overcome, even in chronic cases.

Myth: A person thinking about suicide appears necessarily depressed.
Reality: Symptoms vary based on individual personality. Behind the facade of a clown or a tough guy may lie great sadness.

Myth: An improvement in suicide risk means the danger has passed.
Reality: A person who decides to take their own life may seem relieved or even happy. One might think the crisis is over, but thatâ€™s when vigilance is most crucial. The majority of suicides occur in the three months following the onset of improvement.

Myth: The tendency towards suicide is not hereditary.
Reality: On the contrary, if there are attempts in the family, the risk is higher.

Myth: Suicidal individuals are mentally ill or crazy.
Reality: Not everyone who wants to end their life suffers from a mental illness, and those who do are not always suicidal. A suicidal person may be experiencing a temporary emotional issue or have lost hope in a difficult situation; this does not make them mentally ill.

When a person thinks about suicide, they want to kill the pain, but never the life." - Augusto Cury

**"Reflections on Self"**

"I donâ€™t usually hide who I am from others because, occasionally, I lack control over that: Iâ€™m calm, but sometimes I lose my temper; and I donâ€™t habitually think of others because I wasnâ€™t trained to do so. Despite being transparent, people can only understand us through their own lens. Itâ€™s hard for someone to step out of their little world to extend some lucid understanding to those around them. No one is prepared to decipher others' minds, not even psychologists or psychiatrists, who should be trained to distinguish various personalities, and they often arenâ€™t, much less us laypeople. Thankfully, Iâ€™m usually calm; otherwise, I would live in constant conflict."

**"Political Commentary"**

"The causes are many, but what happens is that there is a huge unwillingness from the political class to act. Partly because we are governed by corrupt individuals and criminals. But anyway, what should be done for the medium and long term would be:

- Reform the penal code, which is already obsolete (eliminate the famous 'saidÃµes', sentence progression, etc.);
- Treat prisoners with military discipline â€“ but not with torture â€“ putting them to work and study as a form of sentence reduction;

- Change the structure of basic education in the country
