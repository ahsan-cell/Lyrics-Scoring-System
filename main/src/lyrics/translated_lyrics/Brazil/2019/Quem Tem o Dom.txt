**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Jerry Smith]  
Safadão, that's the vibe  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom, that's the vibe  
Boom, boom, boom, that's the vibe  

[Verse: Jerry Smith]  
Hey, some people try, but they can't  
Mornings to do it so well  
The boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Dororom...  
Hey, while they grab attention with Chandon  
I solve it with a little change  
Of boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Dororom...  

[Pre-Chorus: Wesley Safadão]  
They try to hack me, but there's no way, it's all fake  
With a dose of my kiss, I quench your thirst  
There's no one else like me on the market  
I am the original (I am the original)  

[Chorus: Wesley Safadão]  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Call on the bass, she can handle the pressure  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Those who have the gift make the booty drop to the ground (Go)  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Call on the bass, she can handle the pressure (Hey)  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Those who have the gift are Jerry Smith and Safadão  

[Post-Chorus: Wesley Safadão]  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Just like this, ahm  
Let's go like this, let's go like this, come on, come on, hey, hey  
It's the vibe, call  

[Verse: Wesley Safadão]  
Hey, some people try, but they can't  
Mornings to do it so well  
The boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Dororom...  
Hey, while they grab attention with Chandon  
I solve it with a little change  
Of boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Dororom...  

[Pre-Chorus: Jerry Smith]  
They try to hack me, but there's no way, it's all fake  
With a dose of my kiss, I quench your thirst  
There's no one else like me on the market  
I am the original (I am the original)  

[Chorus: Jerry Smith]  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Call on the bass, she can handle the pressure  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Those who have the gift make the booty drop to the ground  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Call on the bass, she can handle the pressure  
Boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, dorondorom  
Those who have the gift are Jerry Smith and Safadão  

[Post-Chorus: Jerry Smith & Wesley Safadão]  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom (It's Safadão and Jerry Smith)  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom (Go)  
Boom, boom, boom, boom, dorondorom (Just like this)
