**Translated Lyrics:**

Pick up, baby  
Talk to me!

[Verse]  
I've been rehearsing for over two hours  
For a relapse  
The number's already on the screen  
Just hit the green to connect

[Pre-Chorus]  
Pour me a shot to change my life  
The best you have  
To see if with inspiration from Old Parr it comes  
The little push I need, oh my  
To complete this call, ah

[Chorus]  
Pick up  
Zé the Relapse is calling you  
I don't care  
If you saved my name like that  
What matters is that live  
You call me "benzim"  
Pick up  
Zé the Relapse is calling you  
I don't care  
If you saved my name like that  
What matters is that live  
You call me "benzim"

[Pre-Chorus]  
Pour me a shot to change my life  
The best you have  
To see if with inspiration from Old Parr it comes  
The little push I need, oh my  
To complete this call, ah

[Chorus]  
Pick up  
Zé the Relapse is calling you  
I don't care  
If you saved my name like that  
What matters is that live  
You call me "benzim"  
Pick up  
Zé the Relapse is calling you  
I don't care  
If you saved my name like that  
What matters is that live  
You call me "benzim"

[Outro]  
Pick up!  

(Note: "Old Parr" refers to a brand of whiskey, often associated with celebration and good times in Brazilian culture. "Benzim" is a term of endearment used in a playful or affectionate context.)
