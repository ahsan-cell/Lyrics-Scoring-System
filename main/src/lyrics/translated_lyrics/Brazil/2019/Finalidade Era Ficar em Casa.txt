**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The plan was to stay at home  
But they told me that Penha is the place to be  
So I showed up just to see the girls  
Doing their thing  

[Chorus]  
(Oh with the beat, oh with the beat)  
Oh, with her booty she moves  
On the court, she moves  
Here in Penha, she moves  
On the court, she moves  
Oh, with her booty she moves  
On the court, she moves  
Here in Penha, she moves  
On the court, naughty girl  

[Verse 2]  
Come on, move it, come on, move it  
Come on, shake it...  
Come on, move it, come on, move it  
Come on, shake it...  

[Chorus]  
Oh, with her booty she moves  
On the court, she moves  
Here in Penha, she moves  
On the court, she moves  
Oh, with her booty she moves  
On the court, she moves  
Here in Penha, she moves  
On the court, naughty girl
