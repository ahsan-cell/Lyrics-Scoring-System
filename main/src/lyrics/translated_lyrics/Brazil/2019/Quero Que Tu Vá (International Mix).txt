**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Ananda]  
Kkkk...

[Verse 1: Ananda & Mala Rodríguez]  
Do you know why it happened and I pretend I don't see you?  
Because erasing your face is my greatest wish.  
You’re mocking my tolerance,  
You’ve lost even a little bit of trust from me.  
Don’t try to label me, I don’t fit in your box,  
Respect me if you want respect.  
I won’t show you that today I’m upset,  
But nothing stops me from cursing you in my head.

[Chorus: Ananda & Mala Rodríguez]  
Today I say you can go screw yourself,  
Stop meddling in my life and  
To hell with the one who gave birth to you, where did this come from?  
Today my patience is at zero,  
I want you to go, go screw yourself,  
Stop controlling my life and go  
To hell with the one who gave birth to you, where did this come from?  
Today I’m all about zero tolerance,  
I don’t tolerate you.

[Verse 2: Ananda, Mala Rodríguez & DaniLeigh]  
You're messing with my head, I see you, it’s so lame,  
But, baby, I ain't got the time for fucking games.  
You've got that something I can’t deal with, it's such a shame,  
I wonder why on earth you thought that we would still be friends.  
Don’t try to label me, I don’t fit in your box,  
Respect me if you want respect.  
I won’t show you that I’m upset,  
But nothing stops me from cursing you in my head.

[Chorus: Ananda, Mala Rodríguez & DaniLeigh]  
Please, can you go to hell? I know your type too well,  
Fuck off and mind your own damn business.  
And to hell with the one who gave birth to you, where did this come from?  
Today my patience is at zero,  
I want you to go, go screw yourself,  
Stop controlling my life and  
Please, your shit can't be for real, don’t play me for a fool,  
My lips can't help it, words keep coming, fuck, fuck you.

[Outro: Ananda]  
I don’t tolerate you.  
Haha  
This shit hits hard, huh?
