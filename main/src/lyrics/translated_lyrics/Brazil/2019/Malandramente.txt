**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: MC Nandinho]  
Cunningly, the innocent girl  
Got involved with us just to have some fun  
Cunningly, she put on a needy face  
Caught up with the crew, she started to seduce  
Cunningly, she slipped away home  
Says her mom is calling, we'll see each other around  

[Chorus: MC Nego Bam]  
Oh, you sly one!  
When it was time to get down to business  
The girl slipped away home  
And sent me a little message  
We'll see each other around, we'll see each other around  
We'll see each other around, we'll see each other around  
Oh, you sly one!  
When it was time to get down to business  
The girl slipped away home  
And sent me a little message  
We'll see each other around, we'll see each other around  
We'll see each other around, we'll see each other around  

[Verse: MC Nandinho]
