**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: Felipe Araújo]  
I put on my best clothes to hide my flaws  
I overdid the perfume to impress you  
I arrived early just to see you come in  

[Pre-Chorus: Felipe Araújo]  
And you showed up a little late, but you looked beautiful, my lips fell silent  
But my heart shouted out loud  
So trust in faith, take a chance on her, she’s a good girl  

[Chorus: Felipe Araújo]  
Let’s skip the part where I ask for that fine wine  
The glass doesn’t deserve to smudge your lipstick  
Leave it to me, I have a knack for this  
Let’s skip the part where I ask for that fine wine  
The glass doesn’t deserve to smudge your lipstick  
Leave it to me, I have a knack for this  

[Post-Chorus: Felipe Araújo]  
So what if it’s our first date?  
Today I’ll kiss you, and that’s that  

[Pre-Chorus: Ferrugem]  
And you showed up a little late, but you looked beautiful, my lips fell silent  
But my heart shouted out loud  
So trust in faith, take a chance on her, she’s a good girl  

[Chorus: Ferrugem]  
Let’s skip the part where I ask for that fine wine  
The glass doesn’t deserve to smudge your lipstick  
Leave it to me, I have a knack for this  
Let’s skip the part where I ask for that fine wine  
The glass doesn’t deserve to smudge your lipstick  
Leave it to me, I have a knack for this  
And let’s skip the part where I ask for that fine wine  
The glass doesn’t deserve to smudge your lipstick  
Leave it to me, I have a knack for this  

[Outro: Ferrugem, Felipe Araújo & both]  
So what if it’s our first date?  
Today I’ll kiss you, and that’s that  
Case closed, alright, I’m really going to kiss you  
Felipe Araújo  
Today I’ll kiss you, and that’s that  
Today I’ll kiss you, and that’s that  
Thank you!
