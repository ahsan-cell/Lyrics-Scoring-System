**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Smell of good perfume, hey, you’re in the cage  
Smell of good vibes, hey, you’re in the cage  
Several girls dancing, hey, you’re in the cage  
Friends making money, hey, you’re in the cage  

[Chorus]  
Come on, shake it and roll  
Hey, you’re in the cage, hey, you’re in the cage  
Shaking, shaking and rolling  
Hey, you’re in the cage, hey, you’re in the cage  
Shaking, shaking and rolling  

[Verse 2]  
Go down, you little tease  
Hey, for Dennis, come on, girl  
Go down, you little tease  
Hey, for Dennis, come on, girl  

[Verse 3]  
The plan was to stay home  
But they told me Dennis is the man  
So I showed up just to see the girls  
Doing this  
Hey, with that booty, hey, with that booty  
Hey, with that booty she drags, on the dance floor, she drags  
Hey, for Dennis she drags, on the dance floor, little tease  
Hey, with that booty she drags, on the dance floor, she drags  
Hey, for Dennis she drags, on the dance floor, little tease  

[Verse 4]  
I’ll leave you craving to be with me  
I look at you with a naughty, bad-boy face  
Tonight I brought a surprise for you  
Let’s go to the car, you’ll see  
Inside the car, tonight there will be boldness  
Hey, with Dennis, tonight there will be boldness  
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit for real  
Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit  
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit for real  
Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit  
Inside the car, tonight there will be boldness  
Hey, with Dennis, tonight there will be boldness  
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit for real  
Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit  
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit for real  
Just sit, sit, sit, sit, sit  

[Verse 5]  
Dennis's party is always packed  
Every weekend I have to go  
And friends are always enjoying  
Money in their pockets, the rhythm is like this  
I’m going to the Gaiola party  
With the intention to drink  
I see you at the party and I’m already dancing close  
The way you like it  
I’ll get you excited  
Take you to the alley and make my proposal  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take  
Damn!  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take  
Damn!  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take  
Damn!  

[Outro]  
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit (Go down, you little tease)  
Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit (Hey, you’re in the cage)  
Take, take, take, take  
Take, take, take, take (The way you like it)  
I’m going to the Gaiola party (Tonight there will be boldness)  
Hahaha...
