**Translated Lyrics:**

If the song is about love, you already know what happens  
You forgot I'm the heat, and then the temperature drops  
The way we move, my voice plays on the set  
The sound you love most is what comes when we melt  

No one gives in, if you want it, then you ask  
Because my thirst can't be contained, that's something we don't measure  
If you want to win, just give in, if I don’t ask, who does?  
But what will happen later, no one can promise  
And the night is a child, I came out for the street  
Midnight dances, I’m a daughter of the moon  
I don’t even know where I am, but it could be with you  
I’m fine on my own, but I lend myself to be yours  

I stopped to dance, you stopped to stare  
It won’t take long for you to get tangled in my hair  
Without unraveling, you wanted to listen to me  
The moon illuminating, and I bare-skinned and free  

**[Chorus: Lubs]**  
Let go, like the wind in my hair  
Sending shivers down my spine in a cloud around  
And I think it’s a secret, but it’s that I’m afraid  
That the night dissolves, I swallow the despair and let the longing come  
Because I know it will return  
It will return  

**[Verse 2: Asiatiko]**  
If the song is about love, you already know what happens  
I’ve made several of these for you, and you deserve them all  
If only time could rewind to write even more  
I’d create a bestseller saying that you’re beautiful  
I never liked games, if you miss me, just say so  
Women love affection, it’s not just about the show  
I don’t want to walk alone, I hope love will come  
I want a movie romance with a big bucket of popcorn  
I was born to be cheesy, I flirt while you sleep  
You’re a perfect creation, made in a brainstorming sweep  
Losing is just a point of view or a change of line  
Because those who died on the beach can still cuddle fine  
Put on your leopard lingerie, today I’m feeling lion-hearted  
And the secret to success is knowing how to ring the bell  
I don’t need a casino, nor to win the lottery  
With you in my fate, together we steal the scene  

**[Chorus: Lubs]**  
Let go, like the wind in my hair  
Sending shivers down my spine in a cloud around  
And I think it’s a secret, but it’s that I’m afraid  
That the night dissolves, I swallow the despair and let the longing come  
Because I know it will return  
It will return  

**[Verse 3: Rodrigo Zin]**  
Come see, come see  
What this letter turned into that I wrote for you  
Every word in black waiting for you at the altar  
Every memory, story, just wanting to return  
I can’t say it’s eternal, but  
There’s no beauty like this  
Even hating clichés, I will love you  

**[Verse 4: Dé Saiyajin]**  
What she thinks is law, so relax, I know  
She’s more desired than Sasha Grey  
Lower the tone of voice, everyone goes crazy when she passes  
No fees charged, no, she gives out love for free  
Without a trap, she humiliates the competition, if it’s a contest, she’s Miss  
Aiming true, she’s like Katniss  
Commit me, please, sought after like Crimea  
I’m in the Han Solo role, and she’s Princess Leia  
Are women ribs? What a feverish talk  
If that’s true, she’s with barbecue  
The guys got confused, she’s not Barbie, dude  
Passed through five, wow, it’s a pentakill  
Knocks me out like a jab, those who know can tell  
You won’t find another like her, not even on the deep web  
And I hope it unfolds with the course of events  
So she can console me at a PlayStation 4 level
