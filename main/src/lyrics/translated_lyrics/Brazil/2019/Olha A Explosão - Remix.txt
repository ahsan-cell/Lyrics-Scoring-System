**Translated Lyrics:**

Hey, what a vibe is this?  
Look at the explosion, together with Wesley Safadão  
Come on, Safadão!  
Can you believe it, Kevinho?

[Verse: Kevinho]  
This girl is a terrorist, she's an expert  
Look at what she does at the funk party with her friends  
This girl is a terrorist, she's an expert  
Look at what she does at the funk party with her friends  
Look at what she does at the funk party with her friends

[Pre-Chorus: Wesley Safadão]  
She's very explosive, don't mess with her  
She's very explosive, don't play with her

[Chorus: Kevinho & Wesley Safadão]  
Look at the explosion  
And when she drops it to the ground  
And when she moves it on the ground  
And when she throws it on the ground  
And when she shakes it with her butt on the ground, ground, ground, ground, ground  
Just know that when she drops it to the ground  
When she moves it on the ground  
When she throws it on the ground  
When she shakes it with her butt on the ground, ground, ground, ground, ground

[Interlude: Kevinho & Wesley Safadão]  
Can you believe it, Safadão?  
What a vibe, Kevinho

[Verse: Wesley Safadão]  
This girl is a terrorist, she's an expert  
Look at what she does at the funk party with her friends  
This girl is a terrorist, she's an expert  
Look at what she does at the funk party with her friends  
Look at what she does at the funk party with her friends

[Pre-Chorus: Kevinho]  
She's very explosive, don't mess with her  
She's very explosive, don't play with her

[Chorus: Kevinho & Wesley Safadão]  
Look at the explosion  
When she drops it to the ground  
When she moves it on the ground  
When she throws it on the ground  
When she shakes it with her butt on the ground, ground, ground  
Go, Safadão!  
Just know that when she drops it to the ground (Ground)  
And when she moves it on the ground (Ground, ground, ground, ground)  
And when she throws it on the ground (Ground)  
And when she shakes it with her butt on the ground, ground, ground, ground, ground

[Outro: Kevinho & Wesley Safadão]  
Thanks, Safadão, it's Kevinho and Safadão, can you believe it?  
Thanks, Kevinho, we’re in this together  
Look at the explosion
