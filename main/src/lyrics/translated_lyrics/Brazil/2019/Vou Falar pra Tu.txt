**[Chorus]**  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
I’m gonna tell you, girl, that I’ve never seen  
I’m gonna tell you, girl, someone dancing like this  
Go, go, go, go, go, go shaking it  
Come, come, come, come, come sliding  
Go, go, go, go, go, go shaking it  
Come, come, come, come, come sliding  

**[Chorus]**  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
I’m gonna tell you, woman, that this is the real deal  
I’m gonna tell you, woman, so you shake it  

**[Chorus]**  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
I’m gonna tell you, girl, that I’ve never seen  
I’m gonna tell you, girl, someone dancing like this  
Go, go, go, go, go, go shaking it  
Come, come, come, come, come sliding  
Go, go, go, go, go, go shaking it  
Come, come, come, come, come sliding  

**[Chorus]**  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down nice for me  
I’m gonna tell you, woman, that this is the real deal  
I’m gonna tell you, woman, so you shake it
