**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
It's Delano, damn it!

[Verse]  
Delano dropped another one for all the young girls  
I'm dropping another one for all the young girls

[Chorus]  
She bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She bounces, she stops...  
And freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She, she bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays

[Post-Chorus]  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
For all the young girls  
For every young girl, for all the crowd  
For every naughty one, for the cheeky ones  
She bounces, she freezes, stops  
On her tiptoes she stays

[Chorus]  
She bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She bounces, she stops...  
And freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She, she bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays

[Interlude]  
It's Delano, damn it!

[Verse]  
Delano dropped another one for all the young girls  
I'm dropping another one for all the young girls

[Chorus]  
She bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She bounces, she stops...  
And freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She, she bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays

[Post-Chorus]  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
For all the young girls  
For every young girl, for all the crowd  
For every naughty one, for the cheeky ones  
She bounces, she freezes, stops  
On her tiptoes she stays

[Chorus]  
She bounces, she stops, she shakes, she freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays  
She bounces, she stops...  
And freezes  
She opens, she closes, on her tiptoes she stays

[Outro]  
It's Delano, damn it, he's the man!
