**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Fioti]  
Ah, ah

[Verse 1: J Balvin]  
(Wuh!)  
Let those who are here shout out  
Today, their president will dance (Wuh)  
I'm so stuck in your mind (Can't get out of your mind)  
They want to turn me off, but I have no source  
To dance, there are no tests (Tests)  
This funky beat is fire (Wooh)  
No one is leaving from here (Aye)  
They dance this in the favela (Uh)  
Left, right  
Up, down  
Left, right  
Breaking it down (Wuh)

[Pre-Chorus: MC Fioti]  
It's the captivating flute that messes with the mind  
Of those who are present  
The young girls are wild  
They go crazy and throw themselves at us  
So, I said to her, oh  
(So, I said to her)

[Chorus: MC Fioti & J Balvin]  
Go, go with the bum bum, tam tam  
Move that bum bum, tam tam  
Move that bum bum, tam tam tam  
Move that bum bum, tam tam  
Move that bum bum, tam tam tam  
Move that bum bum, that bum bum  
That bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum  
(Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum)

[Verse 2: Stefflon Don]  
Don  
Back it up, my man, cock it and rev it (And rev it)  
And not just any man can get it (Can get it)  
I don't care if you have good credit  
You better handle the thing when I send it (Wooh)  
Man drop off (Wooh), mama pop off (Wooh)  
Girl walk off (Wooh), until it breaks off (Wooh)  
Don't stop off (Wooh), until it drops off (Wooh)  
Good vibes make the whole dance lack off (Wooh)  
Boy, turn it, see me thing turn up  
Turn up the thing 'til it burns up ('til it burns up)  
Whine on the girl 'til the girl mash up ('til it mash up)  
Back it up like a dump truck  
Ayo, my thing's good (Thing good) and my thing shocks (Thing shock)  
And the thing's set (Thing set), and it's sitting loud (Sit loud)  
And the girl’s good (Girl good), but my face is bad  
'Cause my thing's real, and it can't stop  
Don

[Pre-Chorus: MC Fioti]  
It's the captivating flute that messes with the mind  
Of those who are present  
The young girls are wild  
They go crazy and throw themselves at us  
So, I said to her, oh  
(So, I said to her)

[Chorus: MC Fioti & J Balvin]  
Go, go with the bum bum, tam tam  
Come with the bum bum, tam tam tam  
Go, move the bum bum, tam tam  
Come, drop the bum bum, tam tam tam  
Go, move the bum bum, tam tam  
Come, drop the bum bum  
Go with the bum bum (Hey, Fioti?)  
Breaking it down

[Verse 3: Future]  
I know that thing that you like  
I know the way that you move  
We’re making love the first night, bum bum pac pac bum  
Yeah, hey, big up my jeweler, big up my .45, big up my Ruger  
Hey, big up the bad girl, call that chimmie like king of the bunda  
Yeah, I'm a savage, some of them 21, summon the cougars  
Hey, automatic spazzin', jumping in the crowd just like Uzi  
Yeah, black stallion, I'ma flex and fly out to Cuba  
Yeah, if you got good vibes, let me hear you say Hallelujah  
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus: MC Fioti]  
It's the captivating flute that messes with the mind  
Of those who are present  
The young girls are wild  
They go crazy and throw themselves at us  
So, I said to her, oh  
(So, I said to her)

[Chorus: Mc Fioti & J Balvin]  
Go, shake the bum bum, tam tam tam tam (Come)  
Tam tam tam tam tam tam tam tam (Go)  
Tam tam tam tam tam tam tam tam (Come)  
Tam tam tam tam tam tam tam tam (Go)  
Tam tam tam tam tam tam tam tam (Come)  
Tam tam tam (Like Vavazinho)

[Verse 4: Juan Magán & MC Fioti]  
(Go, go with the bum bum, tam tam)
