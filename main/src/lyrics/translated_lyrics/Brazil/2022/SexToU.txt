**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Rennan da Penha]  
It's Friday and we're having fun  
There's drinks and big cups  
At the P.U party  
Only beautiful, only desire  

[Verse 2: Anitta]  
I'm throwing my lace  
Haters are drooling  
Supporting the wild girl  
Who moves fiercely  

[Chorus: Rennan da Penha]  
I've got my drink, I'm feeling it  
Baby, I'm stalking you  
Thinking about you sitting  
At the P.U, admiring you  
And come dancing, come grinding  
The wild girl of my dreams  
I want to see you grinding  
With my drink, I'm feeling it  

[Chorus 2: Anitta]  
With my drink, I'm feeling it  
Baby, I'm stalking you  
Thinking about me sitting  
At the P.U with this guy  
I'm throwing it and I'm grinding  
The wild girl of your dreams  
I want to see you grinding  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  

[Post-Chorus 1: Rennan da Penha]  
Wild girl, come dancing  
Wild girl, come dancing  
Wild girl, come dancing  
Wild girl, come dancing  
Wild girl, come dancing  

[Post-Chorus 2: Anitta]  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  

[Bridge: Rennan da Penha, Anitta]  
Wild girl  
Anitta  

[Post-Chorus 3: Anitta, Rennan da Penha & Anitta]  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl, I'm throwing it  
Wild girl
