**Translated Lyrics:**

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Provoked, that wild one, moving and coming on strong  
Go ahead, sit down, shake it again  
Come on, come on, sit down, shake it again, go  
Provoked, that wild one, moving and coming on strong  
Go ahead, sit down, shake it again, go, go, go, go, go  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Felipe Original]  
Sitting down, sitting down  
Look at the moves she makes, throwing that big butt to the ground  
Sitting down, sitting down  
Look at the moves she makes, throwing her big butt to the ground, ground, ground, ground, ground  
Throwing her big butt to the ground, ground, ground, ground  

[Post-Chorus: Felipe Original & Eduarda Silva]  
Sitting down, sitting down, sitting down  
Engaging beat, with that smoothness  
On the beat, she sits and represents  
Sit, sit (Sitting down)  
Sit, sit, sit, sit— sit— sit, sit, sit (Sitting down)  

[Interlude: Felipe Original & PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Felipe Original, you take over, I'm tired  
Pe-dro Sampaio, go!  
JS  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Provoked, that wild one, moving and coming on strong  
Go ahead, sit down, shake it again  
Come on, come on, sit down, shake it again, go  
Provoked, that wild one, moving and coming on strong  
Go ahead, sit down, shake it again, go, go, go, go, go  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Felipe Original]  
Sitting down, sitting down  
Look at the moves she makes, throwing that big butt to the ground  
Sitting down, sitting down  
Look at the moves she makes, throwing her big butt to the ground, ground, ground, ground, ground  
Throwing her big butt to the ground, ground, ground, ground  

[Post-Chorus: Felipe Original & Eduarda Silva]  
Sitting down, sitting down, sitting down  
Engaging beat, with that smoothness  
On the beat, she sits and represents  
Sit, sit (Sitting down)  
Sit, sit, sit, sit— sit— sit, sit, sit (Sitting down)  

[Outro: Felipe Original, Pedro Sampaio & JS]  
Felipe Original, you take over, I'm tired  
Pe-dro Sampaio, go!  
Hey, JS, dropped another one, huh?  
Boom, it exploded
