**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Luísa Sonza]  
I'm going to get you hooked on this little groove  
Focus and sit down slowly  
You're crazy, you're wild  
You're wild, you're crazy  
You're crazy, you're wild  
You're wild, you're crazy  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Luísa Sonza]  
You're addicted to shaking that booty  
Take it, take it, take it  
Bass up high  
You're addicted to shaking that booty  
Take it, take it, take it  
Bass up high  

[Post-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Luísa Sonza & Luísa Sonza]  
Attention to the floor, to the floor  
Put your palms on the floor  
To the floor, to the floor  
Put your palms on the floor  
To the floor, to the floor  
Put your palms down  
To the floor, to the floor  
(PE-DRO SAM-PA-IO, go!)  

[Verse 2: Luísa Sonza & PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
My love, I'm a problem for you  
I wear you out and you like it this way  
And I tire you out, tire you out  
While the world is falling apart  
And I tire you out, tire you out  
While the world is falling apart  
You're crazy, you're wild  
You're wild, you're crazy  
You're crazy, you're wild  
You're wild, you're crazy  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Luísa Sonza]  
You're addicted to shaking that booty  
Take it, take it, take it  
Bass up high  
You're addicted to shaking that booty  
Take it, take it, take it  
Bass up high  

[Post-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Luísa Sonza & Luísa Sonza]  
Attention to the floor, to the floor  
Put your palms on the floor  
To the floor, to the floor  
Put your palms on the floor  
To the floor, to the floor  
Put your palms down  
To the floor, to the floor  
PE-DRO SAM-PA-IO, go!  
On the beat drop, Rafinha RSQ
