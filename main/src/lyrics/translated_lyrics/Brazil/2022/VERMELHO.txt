**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Passion, it's been a while since I wanted to find you  
Sipping some wine, you sit and relax here on my couch  
Desire, you know how to excite me  
Your mandrake way drives me crazy, today, I want you (Ahn)  
I come down shaking it for you, with my hand on my curves  
My crimson red dress left you all flustered  
Those lips of yours so red, full of mischief  
Oh, what a delight  

[Pre-Chorus]  
On the lips, cherry red; on the ceiling, neon red  
Red, like the taillight of the ship that plays this sound  
On the lips, cherry red; on the ceiling, neon red  
Red, like the taillight of the ship that plays this sound (Go!)  

[Chorus]  
Who is that girl in red?  
I came to the party just to see her shaking it to the ground  
Who is that girl in red?  
I came to the party just to see her shaking it to the ground  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh, oh, oh  
Red  
Oh, oh oh oh, oh, oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh, oh, oh  
Red
