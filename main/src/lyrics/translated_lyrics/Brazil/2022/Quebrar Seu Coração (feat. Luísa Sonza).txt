**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: Lexa, Luísa Sonza & Both]  
Listen, love, I saw that you called me  
But if you come to talk about love  
I’ll reject your call  
So please, I’m tired of pretending  
One little bounce and you’re already hooked  
You’ve left me with no choice  

[Pre-Chorus: Lexa]  
You got involved with me without fear of danger  
I never intended to, oh  
But today I’m going to break your heart  

[Chorus: Lexa]  
With my butt on the ground, with my butt on the ground  
With my butt, with my butt, with my butt on the ground  
With my butt on the ground, with my butt on the ground  

[Interlude]  
Ruxell's captivating beat  

[Verse: Luísa Sonza, Lexa & Both]  
Listen, love, I saw that you called me  
But if you come to talk about love  
I’ll reject your call, oh  
So please, I’m tired of pretending  
One little bounce and you’re already hooked  
You’ve left me with no choice  

[Pre-Chorus: Luísa Sonza & Lexa]  
You got involved with me without fear of danger  
I never intended to, oh  
But today I’m going to break your heart  

[Chorus: Lexa & Luísa Sonza]  
With my butt on the ground, with my butt on the ground  
With my butt, with my butt, with my butt on the ground  
With my butt on the ground, with my butt on the ground  

[Outro: Lexa]  
I’m going to break your heart  
With my butt on the ground, with my butt on the ground  
With my butt, with my butt, with my butt on the ground  
With my butt on the ground, with my butt on the ground  
I’m going to break your heart  
I did it, huh?
