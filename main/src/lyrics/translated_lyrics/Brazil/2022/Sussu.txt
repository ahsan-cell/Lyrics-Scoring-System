**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Hey, little ones  
So, everyone’s saying that things are gonna be chill  
Lexa  
Really? Just listen up  
Ruxell's captivating beat  

[Verse]  
I came to tell you that the vibe today is chill  
Chill, smooth  
I drive you crazy dancing on the rooftop  
Chill, smooth  

[Pre-Chorus]  
She moves, she shakes  
This is trap with funk, girl  
She moves, she shakes  
This is trap with funk, girl  
When I say go, you’ll come through  
With a little mischief, you’ll throw it down  
3, 2, 1, throw it!  

[Chorus]  
Get down, get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down  
Break it, drop it, throw it, go!  
Get down, get down, get down, get down  
Let it loose, DJ!  

[Interlude]

Get down, get down, get down, get down  
Get down, get down, get down
