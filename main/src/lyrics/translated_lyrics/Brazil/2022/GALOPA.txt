**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Hey, baby, tell me where you are, and I’ll come to see you  
I’m missing you, I’m missing you  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
With us, it’s always like this  
I call you, you call me  
Impossible to forget (Yeah)  
What you know how to do  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
I want to remember  
You sitting on my lap slowly  
Going down and up, then you gallop  
I know you like it, I know you like it, ah, ah  
I want to remember  
You sitting on my lap slowly  
Going down and up, then you gallop  
I know you like it, I know you like it, ah, ah  
I want to remember  

[Post-Chorus: Miguel, PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Gallop, gallop, gallop (PE-DRO SAM-PA-IO)  
Gallop, gallop, gallop (Come on)  
Gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop, gallop  
(Ah, ah)  

[Verse: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Hey, baby, tell me where you are, and I’ll come to see you  
I’m missing you, I’m missing you  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
With us, it’s always like this  
I call you, you call me  
Impossible to forget  
What you know how to do  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
I want to remember  
You sitting on my lap slowly  
Going down and up, then you gallop  
I know you like it, I know you like it, ah, ah  
I want to remember  
You sitting on my lap slowly  
Going down and up, then you gallop  
I know you like it, I know you like it, ah, ah  
I want to remember  

[Post-Chorus: Miguel]  
Gallop, gallop, gallop (PE-DRO SAM-PA-IO)  
Gallop, gallop, gallop (Come on)
