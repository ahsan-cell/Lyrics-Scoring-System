**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Especially for all of them  
I made this beat just to see them  
Going down, going down, going down  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Anitta]  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl, young girl  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl, young girl  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl, young girl  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl  

[Post-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Throw it back  
Back, back, back  
Throw it back  
Back, back, back  
Throw it back  
Back, back, back  
Throw it back  
Back, back  
Call my name  

[Snippet: Anitta]  
Pe-dro Sam-pai-o, go!  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Pre-Verse: Anitta]  
Anitta  

[Verse 1: Anitta]  
Especially for all of them  
I made this hit just to see them  
Going down, going down, going down  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO & Anitta]  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl, young girl  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl, young girl  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl, young girl  
On the floor, young girl, young girl, young girl (Oh!)  
(Throw it back)  

[Verse 2: Anitta]  
I’m gonna throw it in your face  
On all fours, I know you like it  
I can shake it in front of you  
I can shake it behind me  
Dancing, I’ll tease you  
I want to see if you can handle it  
Sequence of love, love  
Sequence of drop it, drop it  

[Snippet: Anitta, PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
PE-DRO SAM-PAI-O, go!  
Ja ja ja ja  

[Outro: Anitta, Anitta & PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Throw it for me, look back  
Are you enjoying? I want more  
Throw it for me, look back  
Are you enjoying? I-I want more  
Throw it for me, look back  
Are you enjoying? I want more  
Throw it for me, look back  
Are you enjoying? I want more
