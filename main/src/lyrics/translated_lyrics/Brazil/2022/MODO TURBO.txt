**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Luísa Sonza]  
Rafinha RSQ, Rennan da Penha  

[Verse 1: Luísa Sonza, Anitta]  
I bet you’ll do what I want  
With all this turbulence, you won’t stay on your feet  
Tonight I’m going wild, a loop of kissing  
Come with me if you can handle this all night long  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, take me to the corner, go ahead  
In my love, love, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, take me to the corner, go ahead  
In my love, love, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh  

[Pre-Chorus: Pabllo Vittar]  
You didn’t even call and I was already there  
If it goes well, it’ll go bad  
You won’t forget  
I’m gonna make it unforgettable  

[Chorus: Luísa Sonza, Pabllo Vittar, Anitta]  
Rocket like NASA leaving the atmosphere  
There’s a turbo in this body and now no one can (Sss)  
Rocket like NASA leaving the atmosphere  
There’s a turbo in this body and now no one can catch me (Go)  
Buckle up, turbo mode, because the ride is out of this world  
Buckle up, turbo mode, sit, sit, sit  
Buckle up, turbo mode, because the ride is out of this world  
Buckle up, turbo mode, sit, sit, sit  

[Pre-Chorus: Pabllo Vittar, Luísa Sonza, Anitta]  
You didn’t even call and I was already there (And I was already there)  
If it goes well (If it goes well), it’ll go bad  
You won’t (You won’t) forget (Forget)  
I’m gonna make it (I’m gonna make it) unforgettable  

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar, Luísa Sonza]  
Rocket like NASA leaving the atmosphere  
There’s a turbo in this body and now no one can catch me  
Rocket like NASA leaving the atmosphere  
There’s a turbo in this body and now no one can catch me  

[Verse 2: Anitta, Luísa Sonza]  
Come with me if you can handle this all night long  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, take me to the corner, go ahead  
In my love, love, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh  
Crazy, crazy, crazy, take me to the corner, go ahead  
In my love, love, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh  

[Chorus: Pabllo Vittar, Anitta, Luísa Sonza]  
Rocket like NASA leaving the atmosphere  
There’s a turbo in this body and now no one can catch me  
Rocket like NASA leaving the atmosphere  
There’s a turbo in this body and now no one can catch me  
Buckle up, turbo mode, because the ride is out of this world  
Buckle up, turbo mode, sit, sit, sit  
Buckle up, turbo mode, because the ride is out of this world  
Buckle up, turbo mode, sit, sit, sit  

[Outro: Anitta]  
Come with me if you can handle this all night long
