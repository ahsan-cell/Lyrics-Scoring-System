**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I’ve arrived, huh?!  
Hitmaker  
Lexa, Lexa, Lexa  

[Verse 1]  
An expert at the game  
She doesn’t know how to lose  
She’s on another level  
Game over for you  

[Chorus]  
Don’t freak out, don’t freak out, just endure  
This brutal play  
Don’t freak out, endure  
Come on, join the contest  
Don’t freak out, endure  
This brutal play  
Don’t freak out, endure  
Come on, join the contest  

[Post-Chorus]  
Please, please  
Please, please  
It’s about to start, it’s about to start, it’s about to start  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down  
Sit down, sit down, sit down  

[Verse 2]  
I’m in the game and now it’s about to begin  
My crew is ready to take over  
When I arrive, everyone stops to stare  
So come on, better get ready  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m in control  
I’m the one in charge today  
I came to win  
I came to stay  
I’m in control  
I’m the one in charge today  
I came to win  
Come on, I’ll teach you how  

[Chorus]  
Don’t freak out, don’t freak out, just endure  
This brutal play  
Don’t freak out, endure  
Come on, join the contest  
Don’t freak out, endure  
This brutal play  
Don’t freak out, endure  
Come on, join the contest  

[Post-Chorus]  
Please, please  
Please, please  
It’s about to start, it’s about to start, it’s about to start  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down  
Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down  
Sit down, sit down, sit down
