**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Gloria Groove

[Verse 1]  
I called up my girls, and you know they’re coming through  
From the base, from the valley, leave that behind and join too  
You know the crew is tight, we’re all in this together  
Can’t just stand still to this captivating beat forever

[Pre-Chorus]  
Are you ready  
For the dance floor?  
Dive in  
To life  
Want to talk about daring?

[Chorus]  
Oh...  
What a good thing!  
The world’s falling apart, but we’re in charge of this scene  
If you mess with me, you’ll mess with the whole team  
We’re prepared, bring it on, it’s gonna be a good thing  
A-a-a-a-a...  
What a good thing!  
The world’s falling apart, but we’re in charge of this scene  
If you mess with me, you’ll mess with the whole team  
We’re prepared, bring it on, it’s gonna be a good thing  
A-a-a-a-a...

[Post-Chorus]  
Ruxell’s captivating beat

[Verse 2]  
(Yuh!) The crew is heavy, turning into dawn  
Sharing the vibe from the party to the streets we’re on  
She’s wild, she’s fierce, throwing it in your face  
Killing it on the beat, taking down the disgrace  
She’s a queen, she’s the vibe, like a party in Ibiza  
No limits on my Visa, heavy hitter, like IZA  
Sought after on every corner  
She’s the boss of the rhyme game  
She arrives changing the weather  
She knows how to play, so clever  
Did you think we’d disappear?  
Thought we wouldn’t even show here?  
The world’s falling apart, we’re causing a stir  
Running everything around here (Yuh!)

[Pre-Chorus]  
Are you ready  
For the dance floor?  
Dive in  
To life  
Want to talk about daring?

[Chorus]  
Oh...  
What a good thing!  
The world’s falling apart, but we’re in charge of this scene  
If you mess with me, you’ll mess with the whole team  
We’re prepared, bring it on, it’s gonna be a good thing  
A-a-a-a-a...  
What a good thing!  
The world’s falling apart, but we’re in charge of this scene  
If you mess with me, you’ll mess with the whole team  
We’re prepared, bring it on, it’s gonna be a good thing  
A-a-a-a-a...

[Post-Chorus]  
Ruxell’s captivating beat

[Outro]  
What a good thing!
