**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Frog]  
MC-MC Frog!  
It's Davi Kneip, alright!  
Gabriel do Borel, produced, exploded, boom!

[Verse 1: MC Frog]  
They say her heart is cold and that she never feels a thing  
But everyone she sits with, this girl falls in love, it seems  
She wants to play tricks on the bad boys, but me, I'm wise  
In less than two weeks, she got caught up with our lies  
She got caught up with our lies

[Pause: Luísa Sonza]  
What?  
Oh no, no, no  
I can't believe what I'm hearing right now  
You all are lying out there, and you think I won't find out?  
Hold on, let me get real with you

[Verse 2: Luísa Sonza]  
Sneaking in softly, changing up this beat  
All cute like a Hello Kitty doll  
But don’t worry if I called you my boyfriend  
Counting on you, I think I’ve got about twenty more

[Pre-Chorus: Luísa Sonza]  
Where I bounce, where I sit, they’re asking for my hand  
A mother’s heart is big, I’m not wasting any time  
Where I bounce, where I sit, they’re asking for my hand  
A mother’s heart is big, I’m not wasting any time

[Chorus: Luísa Sonza]  
Sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sit-ting pret-ty  
Says it’s without feelings, but when I sit, they fall for me  
Sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sit-ting pret-ty  
Says it’s without feelings, but when I sit, they fall for me  
Sitting pretty, sitting pretty, sit-ting pret-ty  
Says it’s without feelings, but when I sit, they fall for me

[Post-Chorus: Davi Kneip & Gabriel do Borel]  
She’s moving, tossing the ball up and down  
She’s moving, tossing the ball up and down  
Oh wow, oh damn, oh wow, oh damn  
Oh wow, oh damn, oh wow, oh damn  
She’s moving, tossing the ball up and down  
She’s moving, tossing the ball up and down  
Oh wow, oh damn, oh wow, oh damn  
Oh wow, oh damn, oh wow, oh damn

[Outro: MC Frog & Gabriel do Borel]  
MC Frog!  
Davi Kneip!  
Luísa Sonza  
Oh wow  
Gabriel do Borel, you know?  
Damn, this Luísa is amazing, I fell in love
