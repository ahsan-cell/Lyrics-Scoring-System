**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Rebecca & Lexa]  
The fight will begin  
Ahn  
Hitmaker  

[Verse 1: Anitta & Lexa]  
Now the fight will begin  
Chemistry, chemistry, heartbeats, heartbeats  
Today it’s going to be an all-out brawl  
No draws here, things are real  
My butt will knock anyone out  

[Pre-Chorus: Luísa Sonza & MC Rebecca]  
Oh, put your face out to see what will happen  
I’m going to hurt you, you’ll take a beating  

[Bridge: Anitta & Lexa]  
Turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum  
Turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum  
Turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum  

[Chorus: Luisa Sonza, MC Rebecca, Anitta & Lexa]  
Round 1, shake the boat, shake, shake  
Round 2, let it drop  
Round 3, play, play, play the big guy  
It ends when it hits the floor, hits the floor  

[Verse 2: Luísa Sonza & MC Rebecca]  
Now the fight will begin  
Chemistry, chemistry, heartbeats, heartbeats  
Today it’s going to be an all-out brawl  
No draws here, things are real  
My butt will knock anyone out  

[Pre-Chorus: Lexa & Anitta]  
Oh, put your face out to see what will happen  
I’m going to hurt you, you’ll take a beating  

[Bridge: MC Rebecca & Luísa Sonza]  
Turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum  
Turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum, turudum  

[Chorus: Luisa Sonza, MC Rebecca, Anitta & Lexa]  
Round 1, shake the boat, shake, shake  
Round 2, let it drop  
Round 3, play, play, play the big guy  
It ends when it hits the floor, hits the floor  
(Yeah!)  

[Outro: Luisa Sonza, MC Rebecca, Anitta & Lexa]  
Play, play, go  
Play, play  
It ends when it hits the floor, hits the floor  
Do you want to take a beating?  
(Hitmaker)  
It ends when it hits the floor, hits the floor
