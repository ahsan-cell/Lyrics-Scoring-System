**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Oh, eh, oh, eh, eh, oh, eh, oh  

[Verse: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
This girl is pure talent coming down  
Raise your hands up high if you're going crazy  
This girl is pure talent coming down  
Raise your hands up high if you're going crazy  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
On the dance floor, she loves to dance  
On the dance floor, she loves to dance  

[Chorus: MC Pedrinho, PEDRO SAMPAIO & Both]  
Hot girl, she leans in on the beat, shaking it like Anitta  
Hears the rhythm and suddenly she becomes a dancer  
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, eager to sit down  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, eager to sit down  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, eager to sit down  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, hey  

[Post-Chorus: Anitta]  
I'm going to tease, I'm going to drop it low, I'm going to provoke  
I'm going to tease, I'm going to drop it low, I'm going to provoke (Throw it up)  

[Verse: PEDRO SAMPAIO & MC Pedrinho]  
This girl is pure talent coming down  
Raise your hands up high if you're going crazy  
This girl is pure talent coming down  
Raise your hands up high if you're going crazy  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
On the dance floor, she loves to dance  
On the dance floor, she loves to dance  

[Chorus: MC Pedrinho, PEDRO SAMPAIO & Both]  
Hot girl, she leans in on the beat, shaking it like Anitta  
Hears the rhythm and suddenly she becomes a dancer  
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, eager to sit down  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, eager to sit down  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, eager to sit down  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, hey  

[Post-Chorus: Anitta]  
I'm going to tease, I'm going to drop it low, I'm going to provoke  
I'm going to tease, I'm going to drop it low, I'm going to provoke  

[Outro: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Eager to sit down
