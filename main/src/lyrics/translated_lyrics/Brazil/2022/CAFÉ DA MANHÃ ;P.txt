**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Luísa Sonza]  
Mmm

[Verse 1: Luísa Sonza]  
I’m being serious  
I know that in the morning, you wake up feeling emotional, so go ahead  
Breakfast in bed is the best there is  
You’re already igniting the fire, I just woke up  
You know you can’t fool me, just tell me  
You know it’s the best way to start the day (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Luísa Sonza]  
So you can pull me close, keep lying down  
Relax, babe, you don’t even need to get up  
I know you’re not tired, want pure pleasure? Sure  
I’ll gift you my—

[Pre-Chorus: Luísa Sonza]  
If you want, you can stay, just don’t hurt me  
No need to ask me  
I was minding my own, then you appeared out of nowhere  
Once it starts, it doesn’t stop

[Chorus: Luísa Sonza, LUDMILLA]  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts, it doesn’t stop  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts, it doesn’t stop  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts, it doesn’t stop  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts

[Post-Chorus: Luísa Sonza, LUDMILLA]  
Come bite my apple  
You can be my breakfast (Pull to the side, go)  
Come bite my apple  
You can be my breakfast (Mmm)

[Interlude: Luísa Sonza, LUDMILLA]  
(Come on, Ludmilla, come)  
(Ludmilla in the house)  
(Go)

[Verse 2: LUDMILLA]  
Okay, coffee on the table, hands behind your back, you’re trapped  
Today you’re going to be my feast, shh! Quiet  
Slow movements, everything in rhythm, with talent  
It was you who wanted to get to know me, naughty girl

[Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
So pull me close, keep lying down  
Relax, babe, you don’t even need to get up  
I know you’re not tired, want pure pleasure? Sure  
I’ll gift you my— (Hahaha)

[Pre-Chorus: LUDMILLA, Luísa Sonza]  
If you want, you can stay, just don’t hurt me (Uh-huh)  
No need to ask me  
I was minding my own, then you appeared out of nowhere  
Once it starts, it doesn’t stop

[Chorus: LUDMILLA, LUDMILLA & Luísa Sonza, Luísa Sonza]  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts, it doesn’t stop  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts, it doesn’t stop  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts, it doesn’t stop  
(Come on, babe) Once it starts (Huh)

[Post-Chorus: Luísa Sonza, LUDMILLA]  
Come bite my apple  
You can be my breakfast (Pull to the side, go)  
Come bite my apple  
You can be my breakfast (Oh)  
Come bite my apple  
You can be my breakfast  
Come bite my apple  
You can be my breakfast

[Outro: Luísa Sonza & LUDMILLA]  
Keep on all fours, then stay lying down  
Relax, babe, you don’t even need to get up  
La-ra-ra-ra, ra-ra-ra-ra, ra-ra-ra-ra, ra-iá  
La-ra-la-ra, la-ra-la-ra
