**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: LUDMILLA]  
Yeah, I got it  
Three in the morning calling me (Calling me)  
I know, go ahead  
Just don’t say "I love you" (Love you)  

[Pre-Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
When we were together  
You were always messing up, ah  
And now you’re calling at this hour  
To say that you loved me  

[Chorus: LUDMILLA & MC GW]  
You didn’t love me at all, stop playing  
Cut it out, you won’t fool me  
You didn’t love me at all, go ahead and say it  
You only think of me when you want to hook up  
You didn’t love me at all, stop playing  
Cut it out, you won’t fool me  
You didn’t love me at all, go ahead and say it  
You only think of me when you want, haha (Just like that, girl, go on)  

[Post-Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
You didn’t love me at all  
Not at all  
(Come on, DJ)  

[Verse 2: Xamã]  
You didn’t love me at all, you liar  
Coming in all cute trying to fool me  
Missing me? Not a chance, drop the story  
Sending little messages wanting to meet up  
You didn’t love me at all, damn it  
Your fake friend saw me, I was packing heat  
Her pants almost fell down, she wanted to pay for a hit, yeah  
What the hell? Yeah, say you didn’t even see me  
Say we’re the terror of Rio  
Look at who you hang with  
Just remember you don’t call the shots  
After parties, love  
In your story, your body moves  
In the DMs, nudes flood  
Our crew hates snitches, hey  
Your brown butt, you’re my summer muse  
My heart only lies when it loves you  

[Pre-Chorus: LUDMILLA, Xamã]  
When we were together  
You were always messing up, ah (Messing up)  
And now you’re calling at this hour  
To say that you loved me  

[Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
You didn’t love me at all, stop playing  
Cut it out, you won’t fool me  
You didn’t love me at all, go ahead and say it  
You only think of me when you want to hook up  
You didn’t love me at all, stop playing  
Cut it out, you won’t fool me  
You didn’t love me at all, go ahead and say it  
You only think of me when you want, haha (Dennis, yeah, he’s the man)  

[Post-Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
Not at all  
You didn’t love me at all  

[Outro: LUDMILLA]  
Hey, Dennis, three in the morning is just wrong, right?
