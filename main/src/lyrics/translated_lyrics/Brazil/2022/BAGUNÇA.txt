**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
For you who loves this movement  
For you who enjoys this moment  
I want to see you bounce, rise and fall  
I’ll wrap you up so you’ll never forget it all  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Show me all your skills  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Bounce with desire, sit with desire  
Show that this body really knows how to stir up a fire  
Bounce with desire, sit with desire  
Show that this body really knows how to stir up a fire  
Bounce with desire, sit with desire  
Show that this body really knows how to stir up a fire  

[Post-Chorus: Miguel]  
PE-DRO SAM-PA-IO, let’s go!  
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, shake it up  
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, shake it up  

[Bridge: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, bodies were made to shake it up  
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, bodies were made to shake it up  

[Verse: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
For you who loves this movement  
For you who enjoys this moment  
I want to see you bounce, rise and fall  
I’ll wrap you up so you’ll never forget it all  

[Pre-Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Show me all your skills  

[Chorus: PEDRO SAMPAIO]  
Bounce with desire, sit with desire  
Show that this body really knows how to stir up a fire  
Bounce with desire, sit with desire  
Show that this body really knows how to stir up a fire  
Bounce with desire, sit with desire  
Show that this body really knows how to stir up a fire  

[Post-Chorus: Miguel]  
PE-DRO SAM-PA-IO, let’s go!  
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, shake it up  
Shake it up, shake it up, shake it up, shake it up
