**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Hitmaker

[Verse: POCAH]  
Look who’s back  
To their despair  
The bad girl has awakened  
She was asleep for months  
Weekdays are nice  
But on weekends, let’s go  
I like a little love  
But I prefer a fling  
I’ve tried to settle down  
But my crew won’t let me  
I want to date  
But only from Monday to Friday

[Chorus: POCAH]  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love  

[Post-Chorus: MC WM]  
If it’s boldness that she likes  
If it’s boldness that she likes  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  
If it’s boldness that she likes  
If it is, if it’s boldness that she likes  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  

[Interlude: POCAH]  
The universe can attest that I tried to settle down  

[Verse: POCAH, MC WM & POCAH & MC WM]  
Look who’s back (Ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn)  
To their despair  
The bad girl has awakened  
She was asleep for months (Aiiii)  
Weekdays are nice  
But on weekends, let’s go  
I like a little love  
But I prefer a fling  
I’ve tried to settle down  
But my crew won’t let me  
I want to date  
But only from Monday to Friday (Ahn, ahn, ahn, ahn)

[Chorus: POCAH, MC WM & POCAH & MC WM]  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love (Go, go)  
Neither on, nor off  
I’m torn between boldness and love (Go, go)  
Neither on, nor off (Ihhhh)  
I’m torn between boldness and love (WM again, huh)

[Post-Chorus: MC WM & POCAH]  
If it’s boldness that she likes  
If it’s boldness that she likes  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  
If it’s boldness that she likes  
If it is, if it’s boldness that she likes  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  
Take it from the front (Ooh)  
Take it from the back  

[Outro: POCAH]  
It’s not my fault  
It’s my zodiac sign  
What can I do?
