**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Mr. Vegas]  
Mr. Vegas  
Topo La Maskara  
Sexy Ludmilla  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

[Verse 1: LUDMILLA]  
Look who just arrived, baby  
The crew of Ludmilla  
Today I'm going to turn it up  
Throw everything into this vibe  

[Pre-Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it  

[Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
Big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, take it  

[Verse 2: Mr. Vegas]  
One punchinela, two punchinela  
Three punchinela, four (Hey)  
Sexy Ludmilla, go, Tatiana  
Back it up on the dancefloor  
Make it jump up, bam-bam, jump, jump  
Make it jump, jump, jump, make it jump up  
Make it jump, ju-ju-jump, ju-ju-jump, ju-ju-jump  
Ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-ju-jump up  
Move your body, make me happy  
Heart skips a beat, can't even stop me  
Go down on the ground and whine  
Whine, whine, shake it, whiney  

[Verse 3: LUDMILLA]  
DJ Snake called Ludmilla and the party's already started  
Come here, young one, all naughty  
You hear this sound and you get all wet  
(There's a vibe) Take a seat, (There's a vibe) a fierce seat  
(There's a vibe) Take a seat, (There's a vibe) a fierce seat  

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah Angeliq]  
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it  

[Chorus: Mariah Angeliq & LUDMILLA]  
Big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, take it  

[Verse 4: Mariah Angeliq]  
(It's Mariah, babe)  
I like the hot one, you like my curves  
Get on the boat before it sinks  
You're diving into deep waters  
Sharpen that pencil  
Baby, use it well, Iâ€™ll bounce for you  
Whatever you want, come and I'll explain  
Caipirinha, I'll squeeze the juice for you  
With me, it's all out, I don't hold back  
Take it, take it, strip down because we're going to sweat  
Take it, take it, if the boy gets into it, I'll let you play  
Take it, take it, strip down because we're going to sweat  
Take it, take a little bit of Mariah that's going to tease you  

[Verse 1: LUDMILLA]  
Look who just arrived, baby  
The crew of Ludmilla  
Today I'm going to turn it up  
Throw everything into this vibe  

[Pre-Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it  

[Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
Big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, just big move  
Take it, take it, just sit down  
Take it, take it, take it  

[Post-Chorus: LUDMILLA]  
(There's a vibe) Take a seat, (There's a vibe) a fierce seat  
(There's a vibe) Take a seat, (There's a vibe) a fierce seat  

[Outro: Mariah Angeliq, Mr. Vegas, LUDMILLA with Mr. Vegas]  
Take it, take it, baby girl in Jamaica  
Take it, take it, sexy Ludmilla  
Take it, take it, baby girl in Gandara  
Take it, take it, come whine, prettier than anything  
Hey, Ludm
