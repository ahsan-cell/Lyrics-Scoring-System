**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Hitmaker

[Verse]  
Ah, alright, now you want to boss me around  
Poor thing, you're just a casual fling  
Lower your tone, respect your mama here  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Look at him all full of himself, acting crazy  
Soon I'll do to you what I did to another  
If my dancing bothers you, love, I think that's just too little (Oh)  
Oh, how annoying  

[Chorus]  
Let me remind you that I'm not obligated to anything  
No one commands this body  
A backside like this wasn't born to be commanded  
No one commands this body  
Let me remind you that I'm not obligated to anything  
No one commands this body  
A backside like this wasn't born to be commanded  
No one commands this body  

[Post-Chorus]  
Look how he drools  
Hey, drool baby over this body  
Hey, drool baby drool  
Hey, get a close-up of this body  
Hey, drool baby drool  
Hey, drool baby  
No one commands this body  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Look at him all full of himself, acting crazy  
Soon I'll do to you what I did to another  
If my dancing bothers you, love, I think that's just too little (I think that's too little)  
Oh, how annoying  

[Chorus]  
Let me remind you that I'm not obligated to anything  
No one commands this body  
A backside like this wasn't born to be commanded  
No one commands this body  
Let me remind you that I'm not obligated to anything  
No one commands this body  
A backside like this wasn't born to be commanded  
No one commands this body  

[Post-Chorus]  
Look how he drools  
Hey, drool baby over this body  
Hey, drool baby drool  
Hey, get a close-up of this body  
Hey, drool baby drool  
Hey, drool baby  
No one commands this body  

[Outro]  
Is this another one from Hitmaker?  
Oh dad, stop!
