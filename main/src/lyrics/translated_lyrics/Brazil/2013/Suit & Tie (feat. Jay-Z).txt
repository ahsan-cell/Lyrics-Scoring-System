**Translated Lyrics:**

I’ve got a suit, tie  
I’ve got a suit, tie  
Can I show you a thing or two?  
Just a little something, a little something, baby, because  
I’ve got a suit, tie  
I’ve got a suit, tie  
Let me show you a few little things  
Let me show you a few little things  

**[Bridge: Timbaland]**  
Wait a minute, are you ready JT?  

**[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]**  
I can’t wait to invite you to the dance floor, you’re fresh  
You’re so hot, like a dish just out of the oven  
And I’ll touch you even if I burn myself  
She’s so alluring, she’s mine  
Hey baby, let’s not worry about all those stares  
Because if they study us too closely  
They’ll learn something  
She’s not just anything but a little strange when she does that  
She’s looking so fine tonight  

**[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]**  
And as long as I’ve got my tux  
I’ll leave it on the floor tonight  
And you’ve dressed to the nines  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m dressed all in black and white  
And you’re all decked out in that dress I adore  
Love is in the air tonight  
Let me show you a few little things  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m gonna show you a few little things about love  
While we fall in love  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m gonna show you a few little things about love  
Hey  

**[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]**  
Stop, hold up and let me check out your curves  
And then, I know why they call it big  
It drove me crazy, so I married it  
All is good, ‘cause you belong to me  
Let’s go and show them who you call daddy  
I guess they’re mad ‘cause they wish they had you  
You’re a classic, like Thriller  
And you’re all mine tonight  

**[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]**  
And as long as I’ve got my tux  
I’ll leave it on the floor tonight  
And you’ve dressed to the nines  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m dressed all in black and white  
And you’re all decked out in that dress I adore  
Love is in the air tonight  
Let me show you a few little things  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m gonna show you a few little things about love  
While we fall in love  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m gonna show you a few little things about love  
Hey  

**[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]**  
Hey, Hov, get up from your seat  

**[Verse 3: Jay-Z]**  
I was dressed all in black at that “white” show  
I wore white shoes to that “black” show  
I use my Green Card to buy my Cuban chain  
You all sit back and admire the “light show”  
Nothing goes wrong when we push the limits  
Stoute has the talent to get the best of the best  
What’s the problem? I’m at the restaurant  
And we’re disturbing the customers because of you  
Years of distress, tears on the dress  
She tries to hide her feelings with some hard sex  
It’s truffle season  
A Tom Ford tux for no reason  
I’m buying All Saints for my angel  
And some Alexander Wang too  
A mini skirt and some Nike Dunks  
I’ll show you how to be that guy!  
No rolling papers, you used me but now you’re mad at my success  
I’m high, chilling in Las Vegas  
I’ve got two bottles of D’ussé, I’m not looking for trouble  
You’ve got good genes so a guy wants to try to have you  
Tell your mom I love her ‘cause I love you  
Tell your dad we’re gonna act like a real couple  
Your parents didn’t lose their daughter, they just gained a son  
I’ll show you how to do this, huh!  

**[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]**  
And as long as I’ve got my tux  
I’ll leave it on the floor tonight  
And you’ve dressed to the nines  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m dressed all in black and white  
And you’re all decked out in that dress I adore  
Love is in the air tonight  
Let me show you a few little things  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m gonna show you a few little things about love  
While we fall in love  
Let me show you a few little things  
I’m gonna show you a
