**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The guy who thinks of you all the time  
Counting the seconds if you’re late to arrive  
Who always wants to see you near  
Because he can’t stand being without you here  
And in the middle of the night, he calls your name  
To say that he loves you, it’s not just a game  
That guy is me  

[Verse 2]  
The guy who takes you by the arm  
Bumping into anyone who interrupts your charm  
By your side through thick and thin  
The hero every woman dreams to win  
For you, he faces any danger  
Your best friend, not a stranger  
That guy is me  

[Verse 3]  
The guy who loves you just the way you are  
After love, you lay on his chest, a shining star  
He strokes your hair, whispers sweet things  
Talks about love and the warmth it brings  
In the morning, you wake up with glee  
With a smile that says,  
That guy is me  
That guy is me  

[Bridge]  
I’m the right guy for you  
Who makes you happy and adores you too  
Wipes your tears when you cry  
That guy is me  
That guy is me  

[Verse 4]  
The guy who always waits for you with a smile  
Opens the car door when you walk that mile  
Kisses your lips, embraces you tight  
In love, he looks at you and says, “You’re my light”  
He missed you and complains, it’s true  
He loves you,  
That guy is me  

[Outro]  
That guy is me  
That guy is me  
That guy is me  
That guy is me
