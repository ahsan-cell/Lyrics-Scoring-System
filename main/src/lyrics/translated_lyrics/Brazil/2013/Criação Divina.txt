**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Zezé Di Camargo, Paula Fernandes]  
God created the universe in harmony  
Made the sun to warm our days  
Created the moon to serve as inspiration  
And the rain to quench the thirst of the hinterland  
Made the river just to meet the sea  
Gave my voice the gift of song  
Created the tree, the fruit, and the flower  
Made man, woman, and then made love  

[Chorus: Zezé Di Camargo, Paula Fernandes]  
And He made you for me  
A masterpiece from a dreaming artist  
God made you for me  
A divine creation that I received from the Creator  

[Verse 2: Paula Fernandes, Zezé Di Camargo]  
God created each one with their own gift  
Along with every talent, a mission  
For some, strength, cunning, fame, and power  
For others, the restlessness of knowledge  
From stone, He made diamond, silver, and gold  
And gave each creature a treasure  
He kept the jewel of greatest worth  
And gifted it to this humble singer  

[Chorus: Paula Fernandes, Zezé Di Camargo, Both]  
And He made you for me  
A masterpiece from a dreaming artist  
God made you for me  
A divine creation that I received from the Creator  
And He made you for me  
A masterpiece from a dreaming artist  
God made you for me  
A divine creation that I received from the Creator
