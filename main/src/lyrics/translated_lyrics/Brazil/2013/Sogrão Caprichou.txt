**Translated Lyrics:**

She comes in red, I'm feeling weak  
She dances so enticingly, swaying her hips  
When a fool looks, he skids off the curve  

She makes a sweet face, says goodbye to Dad  
I’ll be back early, I swear! Father-in-law, I’ll take care  
He has no idea what his daughter is capable of  
That little move she does should be censored  

Near Daddy, you’re an angel  
When the father-in-law’s away, you lose your way  
Near Daddy, you’re an angel  
When the father-in-law’s away, you lose your way  

Don’t go away, no, lie down here on the bed  
If your dad asks, you’re with Luan Santana  
I’ll whisper softly, just so you know  
Father-in-law really put in the effort to make you, huh  

In the bedroom mirror, she prepares her arsenal  
She comes in red, I'm feeling weak  
She dances so enticingly, swaying her hips  
When a fool looks, he skids off the curve  

She makes a sweet face, says goodbye to Dad  
I’ll be back early, I swear! Father-in-law, I’ll take care  
He has no idea what his daughter is capable of  
That little move she does should be censored  

Near Daddy, you’re an angel  
When the father-in-law’s away, you lose your way  
Near Daddy, you’re an angel  
When the father-in-law’s away, you lose your way  

Don’t go away, no, lie down here on the bed  
If your dad asks, you’re with Luan Santana  
I’ll whisper softly, just so you know  
Father-in-law really put in the effort to make you, huh
