**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Get ready, now it's time for the powerful show  
They come down and shake it, challenging the fiery ones  
Only those who stir things up, driving away the envious  
Who get all upset when the music plays  
Get ready!

[Pre-Chorus]  
If you're not comfortable anymore, leave the way you came in  
When I start to dance, I drive you crazy, I know  
My army is strong, and we hold the power  
We threaten things like you (Go!)

[Chorus]  
Turn up the sound, so you can see me dancing  
Even you will be drooling  
Stop the party to watch me dance  
Drawing attention for no reason  
Lose your mind, go wild  
Turn up the sound, so you can see me dancing  
Even you will be drooling  
Stop the party to watch me dance  
Drawing attention for no reason  
Lose your mind, go wild

[Outro]  
Go wild  
Go wild  
Get ready!
