**Translated Lyrics:**

Piri pipiripi piri piri little crazy  
She’s acting wild, she’s feeling hazy  
Piri pipiripi piri piri little crazy  
She’s out of her mind, not quite in her place  

She doesn’t walk, she struts with flair  
When she hits the party, she steals the air  
Everyone’s watching, everyone wants to dance  
But she’s just chillin’, lost in her trance  

But after a while,  
She drinks and gets a bit tipsy  
She steps down from her heels,  
And the girl loses her grip  

Piri pipiripi piri piri little crazy  
She’s acting wild, she’s feeling hazy  
Piri pipiripi piri piri little crazy  
She’s out of her mind, not quite in her place  

She doesn’t walk, she struts with flair  
When she hits the party, she steals the air  
Everyone’s watching, everyone wants to dance  
But she’s just chillin’, lost in her trance  

But after a while,  
She drinks and gets a bit tipsy  
She steps down from her heels,  
And the girl loses her grip  

Piri pipiripi piri piri little crazy  
She’s acting wild, she’s feeling hazy  
Piri pipiripi piri piri little crazy  
She’s out of her mind, not quite in her place
