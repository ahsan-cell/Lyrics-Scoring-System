**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Today you can come because I’m wanting  
You can just look, but today I want you, come  
Enjoy it because today I’m feeling this way  
Come closer and don’t stop  
It’s just for today that I’m wanting  
We’ll lose ourselves, we’ll go wild, come on down  
If you can handle it, discover my talent  
Come closer and don’t stop  

[Pre-Chorus]  
See? I came to stay  
Make way for me to pass  
You’ll have to respect  
Don’t stop, no  
Go on, don’t stop  
Don’t stop, no  

[Chorus]  
Come, we’re going to show what we’re made of  
Come, we’re going to show what we’re made of  
Come, because in the end we’ll arrive and ignite  
Come closer and don’t stop  
Come, we’re going to show what we’re made of  
Come, we’re going to show what we’re made of  
Come, because in the end we’ll arrive and ignite  
Come closer and don’t stop  

[Outro]  
Don’t stop  
Don’t stop  
Don’t stop  
Don’t stop
