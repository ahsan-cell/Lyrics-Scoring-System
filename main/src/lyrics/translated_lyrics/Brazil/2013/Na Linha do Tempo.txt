**Translated Lyrics:**

I gave you the stars to draw your sky  
On the timeline, destiny wrote  
In golden letters  
You and I  

How long have I waited  
To find someone like you  
Who fits perfectly into the plans  
That I once made for me  
You and I  

I will say  
That in these lines, there's a bit of both of us  
And we won't leave the now for later  
When I see you, I feel so complete  
Wherever I go  
And in these strokes, I’m trying to describe  
That a thousand words are too few to say  
That feelings change everything, change the world  
This is love  

On the timeline, destiny wrote

To find someone like you  
Who fits perfectly into the plans  
That I once made for me  
You and I  

I will say  
That in these lines, there's a bit of both of us  
And we won't leave the now for later  
When I see you, I feel so complete  
Wherever I go  
And in these strokes, I’m trying to describe  
That a thousand words are too few to say  
That feelings change everything, change the world  
This is love

And in these strokes, I’m trying to describe  
That a thousand words are too few to say  
That feelings change everything, change the world  
This is love  

This is love  
This is love  
Love
