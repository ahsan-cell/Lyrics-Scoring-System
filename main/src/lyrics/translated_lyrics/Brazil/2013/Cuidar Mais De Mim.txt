**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I came to talk about what I lost  
That I've cried, about what I've lived  
Because I loved, I gave myself  
And how many times I smiled  
I came to tell your heart  
That I've tasted disillusion  
Of a love  

[Verse 2]  
I came to say that I also suffered  
And how many times I despaired  
The pain I felt was great  
And since then, I've realized  
That without love, without illusion  
My life is in vain  
That's like dying  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know that part of what I went through  
Was my fault because I let  
Someone else dominate me like this  
I know I need to take better care of myself  

[Chorus]  
It's complicated to forget your smile  
The feelings, the passion that remains  
They will always be the same charms  
But for now, I wish for another love  

[Verse 2]  
I came to say that I also suffered  
And many times I despaired  
The pain I felt was great  
And since then, I've realized  
That without love, without illusion  
My life is in vain  
That's like dying  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know that part of what I went through  
Was my fault because I let  
Someone else dominate me like this  
I know I need to take better care of myself  

[Chorus]  
It's complicated to forget your smile  
The feelings, the passion that remains  
They will always be the same charms  
But for now, I wish for another love  

[Chorus]  
It's complicated to forget your smile  
The feelings, the passion that remains  
They will always be the same charms  
But for now, I wish for another love  

[Chorus]  
It's complicated to forget your smile  
The feelings, the passion that remains  
They will always be the same charms  
But for now, I wish for another love  

[Outro]  
In this moment, I wish for another love  
In this moment, I wish for another love
