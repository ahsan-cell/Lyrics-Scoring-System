**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Magrinho]  
In the scene of the ten-dollar stuff, in the scene of the ten-dollar stuff  
In the scene of the ten-dollar stuff, there's a lot of wildness  
Young girl, then drop it, drop it, drop it  
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it  
Young girl, then drop it for the drama  

[Verse: MC Magrinho]  
In the scene of the ten-dollar stuff, in the scene of the ten-dollar stuff  
In the scene of the ten-dollar stuff, in the scene of the ten-dollar stuff  
In the scene, in the scene, in-, in-  
In the scene, in the scene, in-, in-  
In the scene, in the scene, in the scene, in the scene, in-  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in-, in-, in the scene  
In the scene, in the scene of drop it, drop it, drop it  
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it  
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it  
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it  
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it  

[Outro: MC Magrinho]  
In the scene of the ten-dollar stuff, there's a lot of wildness  
'Ria, 'ria, 'ria, 'ria, 'ria, 'ria, 'ria, 'ria, 'ria  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll  
Roll, roll, roll, roll, roll
