We arrive in peace, I leave in war  
I come to play, just a side note  
We show up in threes, we come in strong, she screams our name when your mom gets down  
She can’t breathe anymore  
It’s worse than a black hole, I’m getting sucked in  
My eyes widen, she’s on me like there’s no time to waste  
We jump on the chance, and your sister’s secondhand, I’d even say rented  
Your watch is fake, you bought it from Casio, huh?  
We’ll see who pays the bill, you call hell, I pick up, hello?  
We’ll see who’s acting wild, your girl’s number’s in my phone, bitch!  
Ha ha  
I want bitches in my clips but only my mom’s in stock  
You’re frustrated, I’m in my dressing room getting polished  
With my girl, we’re making a mess, but your dad’s trying to get close, what?  
I’m clever, we’re making hits like Hubert, hey!  
Sorry, Dad, not Protestant like Martin Luther, hey!  
Never Jack, we drink Glenfarclas  
Sorry ladies, we know we’re classy  
Never a flaw but Glenn took your place  
Your ass is a planet, so I filled the space!  
I’m in the oven, you’re in your kitchen, bitch, you’re with your cousin, bitch  
With the hooligans, we’re doing flips in your pool, bitch  
Don’t act shocked, don’t act tough, what you haven’t done yet, I’ve already lived  
Your rap is trash, when I hit play it makes me sick  
Your girl calls us to get her ass cleaned  
Pop, pop, pop, pop, we took it to drop something good  
Cliché! We took the beat to break her back  
Watch out for those who say without them we’re nothing  
It’s crazy how success only attracts dogs, hey  
Never a worry, never a reprieve  
Never a worry  
She comes to give it to me, hey, hey, hey  
She comes to give it to me, hey, hey, hey  
She comes to give it to me, hey, hey, hey  
She comes to give it to me, hey, hey  
The engine’s cold, I’m arriving on foot  
I had a date, I forgot  
I gotta smash the game but I’ve only got one shot  
So I better aim well  
Full score for the S Gang, keep your full tank for the ride  
Full score Glock goes bang! bang! Keep your full tank with one bullet
