**[Intro]**  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Look for a guy when you feel this stuff  
And kick him when you feel this stuff  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Don't stand still when you take this drug  
Look for a woman when you feel this stuff  
And slap her when you feel this stuff  

**[Verse 1]**  
Never take the name of God in vain  
Don't insult any other human being  
Don't covet what others have in hand  
Never desire Albano's woman (both the ex and the new)  
And never lie to the jurors  
Never smoke in crowded places  
Never use dried-out condoms  
Never take candy from junkies  
Don't wear earrings near your genitals  
Fibra, are you an expert on casual relationships?  
Don't come acting tough with the same old glasses  
Don't throw your personal belongings at the President  
Don't switch from wrong to right  
Don't send us to war without a revolution  
What do you ask the cardinal? The holy blessing  
So that Almighty God helps the world of football?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Don't stand still when you take this drug  
Roll a joint when you feel this stuff  
And pass the joint when you feel this stuff  

**[Chorus]**  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  

**[Verse 2]**  
Don't cheat thinking you're the only one  
Don't pray hoping to be the first  
Don't put yourself in front thinking you're special  
Don't jump from buildings if you can't even fly  
Don't come back from Thailand with two hundred diseases  
Don't bring prostitutes to swap illnesses  
Don't look for Romanian girls on the street at night  
Don't talk about private problems with hookers  
Don't say you know people you never seek out  
Don't buy parrots imported from Hawaii  
Don't act cool at the bar when your team loses  
Don't get a new phone when you don't need it  
Don't get it with internet if you don't even connect  
Don't get Nikes when your feet stink  
Don't ask me to go to Sanremo to do a duet  
Don't ask me to kill your mother in your place  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Move your legs when you feel this stuff  
Move your head when you feel this stuff  
And break your neck when you feel this stuff  

**[Chorus]**  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  

**[Verse 3]**  
Don't think you'll find a great job in town  
Don't aim for big expenses at the end of the month  
Don't think you can learn English with a trip  
Don't curiously watch a Chinese funeral  
Don't drive on the highway if you're drowsy  
Don't get a Porsche at my grandfather's age  
Don't take pictures of me with your video phone  
Don't send my photos to the neighbor's daughter  
Don't think you can quietly sleep with my wife  
You hoped no one would ever tell me anything  
Don't sing victory before the starting whistle  
Don't send me to jail without a shred of evidence  
Don't throw your scooter on your head at the stadium  
Don't steal songs if they invite you on the radio  
Don't do shows on TV as a nice wish  
Don't let yourself be laughed at in a dump  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don't stand still when you feel this stuff  
Lock yourself in when you feel this stuff  
Turn off the radio when you feel this stuff  
And don't be out when you feel this stuff!  

**[Chorus]**  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us  
Do like us
