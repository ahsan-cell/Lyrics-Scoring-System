**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus keeps spinning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus won’t stop turning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus keeps spinning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus won’t stop turning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus keeps spinning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus won’t stop turning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus keeps spinning  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus won’t stop turning  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop spinning  
Stop spinning  
Stop spinning  
Vuk-vuk-vuk, São Mateus won’t stop turning  

**[Verse]**  
Vuk-vuk-vuk, the package just arrived  
On the radio, Caracol shared the news that the cops will be on the lookout  
I come back high from the phonk party and I’m ready to work  
Vuk-vuk-vuk, São Mateus keeps spinning  
Vuk-vuk-vuk, the package just arrived  
On the radio, Caracol shared the news that the cops will be on the lookout  
I come back high from the phonk party and I’m ready to work  
Vuk-vuk-vuk-vuk  
A cycle that never changes  
Rich beyond the curve  
—teza, the bag is on the table  
I have the stuff that only filters out the worst  
A cycle that never changes  
Rich beyond the curve  
—teza, the bag is on the table  
I have the stuff that only filters out the worst  
Vuk-vuk, São Mateus keeps spinning  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop spinning  
Stop spinning  
Stop spinning  
Vuk-vuk-vuk, São Mateus won’t stop turning
