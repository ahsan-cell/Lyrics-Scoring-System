### Track 1: 
**[Verse 1: Sevn Alias]**  
Since the school hall, I've been folding my letters, bro, it's strange  
20K in a warm room, I'm sweating, no sauna  
Cancer street, find me on the corner, no coward  
Cooking dance, flipping white like I'm having sex with Laura  
The ass is getting strong, look how the whole room is blue  
Misty goon, you only make moves when it’s about you  
My cheese head is hot, I hope you don’t make a mistake  
Today I'm with Pietju, he might knock you out  
Wearing that silver cape because silence is golden  
I chase bands, don’t talk to me if you’re not talking money  
I spin a thick question, ask my mom about the situation  
She handles my finances, I don’t even build with my mates anymore  
Bro, I'm on the streets, skipping my sleep because  
I can also sleep in the morning, I’ll keep going  
Earning on that deck, earning, I grab cash  
I’m no hero but I swear I’ll save  
Everything that’s crooked, I’ll set right  
I’m focused on my paper like a hustler at the table  
Meet that hustler at the table, I pull stuff, he pulls stacks  
I want to sit well, expensive couch, not on a saddle  
Set phones glowing red-hot, buyers are saddled with goods  
The things I said, you saw first as a fable  
But now she sees it works, seeks contact like a cable  
I don’t hang with those bitches, need to cut them like my nails  
Money black, it shouldn’t come to light like Anton Karel  
Those men grow old and catch wrinkles like dates  
7A, I ball like Cristiano, you ball like Van der Maarel  
The stones in my chain are big, sparkling like pearls  
Checkmark on that 'gram, DMs full of models  

**[Verse 2: Josylvio]**  
Find me on the road with a thick ass in my mouth  
Chocolate milk in my hand, we drive on the left side  
Tell me who’s the man, this summer my pinky’s a diamond  
This summer I’m low-key with a thick ass in my hand  
On the beach or in the Benz, fuck new friends  
We’re looking for cash, I have no room for losers  
This rap shit brings agenda plus it brings me racks  
Sweetie from that ass keeps me relaxed  
They want to book me at schools, I used to skip class  
They said: "You won’t achieve anything if you stay who you are."  
But now I wave with a stack to my old teacher  
And her nephew and niece pump my tracks anyway  
In the west, that’s where I am and where I stay  
They want to cling to my body now they see I’m spinning  
Tell those motherfucking putas “keep your distance from me”  
I’m on cash, we move fast, and that’s the road I ride  
My homie said a while back: “You’re gonna kill it, let them tremble, bradda.”  
I take my time now with a crown and a long call  
I let them fall, let them fall like those things pop  
Undercover lovers, I have bitches, I’m not like those men  
Skip that shit man BeatsbyEsko 2018 VanKlasse Hella Cash Gang

### Track 2: Kuifje  
**[Verse 1: Jonna Fraser]**  
Getting messages on the app again, manager says “you’re leaving money on the table”  
And that’s dumb, because with money you bring in money  
Jonna Fraser, you can’t find me lacking in a story  
She can seduce all she wants, but we’re not binding  
Everything is new, I see bitches on a boat  
With a cigar in my mouth and the sun glowing on me  
Test a nigger, you turn into a ghost  
Don’t talk big, you don’t even know where you live  
I rep 075 and I’ll do that till death  
In Amsterdam, I’m in the east, in Rotterdam, I’m in the south  
I’ve lived everywhere, and everywhere I’m at home  
You assume everywhere, all your plans fall apart, nigga  

**[Pre-hook: Jonna Fraser]**  
Stack long, it falls slanted like a quiff  
I need to train but enjoy my belly  
Ten dozoes I make like that from a dime  
I’m going crazy but my heart is pure  

**[Hook: Jonna Fraser]**  
I’m not alone when I ball and ball and ball and ball and ball and oh yeah  
I’m not alone when I fall and fall and fall and fall and fall and
