**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I know very well about this girl  
We already know the game  

[Verse 1]  
She’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She’s wild in DZ7  
Wild in DZ7, wild in DZ7, wild in DZ7  

[Verse 2]  
She’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She’s wild in DZ7 (oh)  
Wild in DZ7 (oh), wild in DZ7 (oh)  
Wild in DZ7 (oh), wild in DZ7 (oh)  

Wild in DZ7, wild in DZ7 (oh)  
Wild in DZ7 (oh), wild in DZ7 (oh)  
Wild in DZ7  

[Verse 3]  
I sit and I lose myself, I sit and I lose myself  
I sit and I lose myself-self-self-self-self-self  
I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
Lose myself-self-self-self-self  

I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
I sit and I lose myself (oh)  
Lose myself-self-self-self-self  

[Interlude]  
I know very well about this girl  
We already know the game  

[Verse 1]  
She’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild, she’s wild, she’s wild  
She-she-she’s wild in DZ7, wild in DZ7  
Wild in DZ7, wild in DZ7
