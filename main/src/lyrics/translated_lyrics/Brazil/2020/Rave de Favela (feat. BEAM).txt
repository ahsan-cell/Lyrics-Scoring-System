**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: MC Lan & Anitta]  
Oh!  
Hmm  
Anitta, Major Lazer  
And him  
MC Lan, again!

[Verse 1: MC Lan, Anitta & together]  
Bullet, liquor (Yeah), sweet treat (Yes), bottle (Huh)  
VIP area, wristband (Ahn), women (Yes), single (Me)  
Is there a blonde? (Huh) She's here  
Brunette? She's here  
Dark-skinned? She's here  
And the redheads? They're here  
There's a combo, MD, VIP zone (Ah, there is)  
There's gin, there's whiskey, there's drinks (GT)  
There's smoke, Vermouth, and hookah (Hookah)  
There's an after-party in the best suite (Ah, there is)  
There's funk, lots of young girls (Young girls)  
There's sex, but there's protection (Ah, there is)  
Boy who kisses girl, who kisses boy, who kisses girl (Girl)  
There's Diplo, there's Lan, there's Anitta  
There's curves, there's dancing, there's boldness  
Raise your glass (Go), madness (Go) and us, how?

[Pre-Chorus: MC Lan]  
Ahhh, it's a rave, damn it!  
Ahhh, it's a rave, damn it!

[Chorus: BEAM]  
Now drop, drop, drop, drop  
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop  
Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop

[Post-Chorus: BEAM]  
Gimme that bumpa deh, bumpa deh  
Gimme that bumpa deh, bumpa deh

[Verse 2: Anitta]  
You've been warned, the message is clear  
Just come prepared because it's intense  
Pocket full, everything's set  
Those by my side don’t even understand  
Rave with funk got exciting  
I want to see you come in here  
Come to the lookout, I’ll pretend it’s romance  
Just one chance for this moment  
I’m crazy, it hit me now  
Enjoy it, just come and put it on  
Touch me, just come and put it on  
Go, go, go

[Pre-Chorus: MC Lan]  
Ahhh, it's a rave, damn it!

[Bridge 1: BEAM]  
Drop on your knees, bend down low  
Make sure your backside don't touch the floor  
Drop on your knees, bend down low  
Make sure your backside don't touch the floor  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah  
Wooly, wooly, wooly, wooly  
Wooly, wooly, wooly

[Bridge 2: BEAM & Anitta]  
Whine  
Dip it and drop it then  
Dip it and drop it then  
Dip it and drop it then  
Whine  
Dip it and drop it then  
Dip it and drop it then  
Dip it and drop it then  
Whine

[Outro: BEAM & MC Lan]  
Whine, whine, whine, whine  
Whine, whine, whine, whine, whine  
Whine, whine, whine, whine  
Whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine  
Bumpa deh, gimme that bumpa deh (Gimme that)  
Bumpa deh, gimme that bumpa deh (Gimme that)  
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it  
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it  
Pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it  
Pump it, pump it  
Ahhh, it's a rave, damn it!
