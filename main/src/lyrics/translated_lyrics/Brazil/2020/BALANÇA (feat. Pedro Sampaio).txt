**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Pedro Sampaio]  
She wanted to get involved because she’s feeling nostalgic  
Wants to go back home tired, with her legs trembling  
Caught up in the movement  

[Pre-Chorus: Pedro Sampaio]  
Sit down if you’re feeling nostalgic  
Show that you’re interested  
Throwing, throwing, throwing, throwing  
Throwing, throwing, throwing, throwing  

[Chorus: Pedro Sampaio]  
Dance, your hips sway  
You drop it low, sway, sway, sway  
Dance, your hips sway  
You drop it low, sway, sway, sway  
Dance, your hips sway  
You drop it low, sway, sway, sway  

[Bridge: MC GW]  
Hey, go down on all fours, come on all fours  
Go, go, hey, go down, go down on all fours  
Hey, go down on all fours, come on all fours  
Go, go, hey, go down, go down...  

[Verse 2: FP do Trem Bala]  
She shows up at the party in the favela (Call her), calls her friends  
FP dropped the heat (Let’s go, huh?), oh what a delight  
WC said today there’ll be some boldness  
And it was Pedro who said today there’ll be a little party  
And if you want, you can come dancing for the crew  
Want to feel good floating? Then rise up, night and day (It’s the vibe)  
She works with the crew and loves this energy  
Dance, your hips sway  
You can get involved with the crew  

[Chorus: Pedro Sampaio]  
Dance, your hips sway  
You drop it low, sway, sway, sway  
Dance, your hips sway  
You drop it low, sway, sway, sway  
Dance, your hips sway  
You drop it low, sway, sway, sway  

[Outro: MC GW]  
Hey, go down on all fours, come on all fours  
Go, go, hey, go down, go down on all fours  
Hey, go down on all fours, come on all fours  
Go, go, hey, go down, go down...
