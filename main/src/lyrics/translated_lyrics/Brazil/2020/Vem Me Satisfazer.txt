**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Call us to meet, it could be to heat things up  
Today I want you, come satisfy me  
In your way that I’m into, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  

[Chorus]  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  

[Verse 2]  
I warned you, don’t get involved in my talk  
It was just a rumor to drive you crazy  
I gave you pleasure, you asked for pleasure  
Now what can I do? I don’t want you anymore  
Who said I want to be your woman?  
Get some shame and see if you can leave me alone  
Very wild in the vibe of boldness  
I called the crew to hang out, it’s gonna rain lean*  

[Chorus]  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  

[Verse 1]  
Call us to meet, it could be to heat things up  
Today I want you, come satisfy me  
In your way that I’m into, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  

[Chorus]  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff  
On all fours I shake it, on all fours I shake it  
A sequence of take-take, a sequence of puff-puff
