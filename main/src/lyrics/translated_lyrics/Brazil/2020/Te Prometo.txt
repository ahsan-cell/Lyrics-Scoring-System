**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: MC Don Juan]  
She said she wants to date, but that won’t work  
I’m not the right guy for that kind of relationship  
But if you just want to hang out  
I promise I’ll lend you my body  
I promise I’ll lend you my love  

[Chorus: MC Don Juan]  
Let’s agree on this  
Just call me  
Tell me when you want, and I’ll say I want you too  
If it’s going well, don’t mess it up  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  
Let’s agree on this  
Just call me  
Tell me when you want, and I’ll say I want you too  
If it’s going well, don’t mess it up  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  

[Bridge: Dennis DJ]  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
(I said Dennis, not tennis  
Don’t get it confused)  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  

[Verse: MC Don Juan]  
She said she wants to date, but that won’t work  
I’m not the right guy for that kind of relationship  
But if you just want to hang out  
I promise I’ll lend you my body  
I promise I’ll lend you my love  

[Chorus: MC Don Juan]  
Let’s agree on this  
Just call me  
Tell me when you want, and I’ll say I want you too  
If it’s going well, don’t mess it up  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  
Let’s agree on this  
Just call me  
Tell me when you want, and I’ll say I want you too  
If it’s going well, don’t mess it up  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  
Just call me on all fours, shaking your hips  

[Outro: Dennis DJ]  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it  
Shake it, shake it-shake it  
Shake it, shake it
