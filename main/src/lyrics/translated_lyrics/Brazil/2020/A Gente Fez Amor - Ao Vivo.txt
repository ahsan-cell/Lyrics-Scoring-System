**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
We had agreed  
That everything was already wrong  
That it couldn't go on  
We marked the end point  
But the ending is always the same  
You make me turn back

[Pre-Chorus]  
Douse yourself in perfume  
And wear a smile that drives me crazy  
With the intention to provoke  
How can I let her go?

[Chorus]  
And we made love, oh oh  
It was supposed to end, who said I could?  
And we made love, oh oh  
As if it were the last request  
And we made love, oh oh  
It was supposed to end, who said I could?  
And we made love, oh oh  
As if it were the last request  

[Post-Chorus]  
Douse yourself in perfume  
And wear a smile that drives me crazy  
With the intention to provoke  
How can I let her go?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Douse yourself in perfume  
And wear a smile that drives me crazy  
With the intention to provoke  
How can I let her go?

[Chorus]  
And we made love, oh oh  
It was supposed to end, who said I could?  
And we made love, oh oh  
As if it were the last request  
And we made love, oh oh  
It was supposed to end, who said I could?  
And we made love, oh oh  
As if it were the last request  

[Post-Chorus]  
Douse yourself in perfume  
And wear a smile that drives me crazy  
With the intention to provoke  
And how can I let her go?  

[Chorus]  
And we made love, oh oh  
It was supposed to end, who said I could?  
And we made love, oh oh  
As if it were the last request  
We made love, oh oh  
It was supposed to end, who said I could?  
And we made love, oh oh  
As if it were the last request  

[Post-Chorus]  
Douse yourself in perfume  
And wear a smile that drives me crazy  
With the intention to provoke  
And how can I let her go?
