**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I’ll be honest with you, I think I’ve had enough  
It’s been a while since I’ve been yours, even the bed has noticed  
That it’s gotten too cold and your touch doesn’t bring  
No use throwing sticks on the fire that won’t catch anymore  
Won’t catch anymore, won’t catch anymore  

[Chorus]  
You’ve turned into a memory here inside this house  
When I call you to the bed, you run to the living room  
And you don’t even care to know how I feel  
A few square meters have turned into a labyrinth  
You’ve turned into a memory here inside this house  
When I call you to the bed, you run to the living room  
And you don’t even care to know how I feel  
A few square meters have turned into a labyrinth  

[Post-Chorus]  
Yeah  

[Verse]  
I’ll be honest with you, I think I’ve had enough  
It’s been a while since I’ve been yours, even the bed has noticed  
That it’s gotten too cold and your touch doesn’t bring  
No use throwing sticks on the fire that won’t catch anymore  
Won’t catch anymore, won’t catch anymore  

[Chorus]  
You’ve turned into a memory here inside this house  
When I call you to the bed, you run to the living room  
And you don’t even care to know how I feel  
A few square meters have turned into a labyrinth  
You’ve turned into a memory here inside this house  
When I call you to the bed, you run to the living room  
And you don’t even care to know how I feel  
A few square meters have turned into a labyrinth  

[Post-Chorus]  
Yeah
