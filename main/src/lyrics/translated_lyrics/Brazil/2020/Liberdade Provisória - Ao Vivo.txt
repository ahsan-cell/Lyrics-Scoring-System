**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
At first, it was like this  
It ended, it's over  
Each one to their own side  
No need to call anymore  
But it was me who ended it  
And the one who got left behind doesn’t wait  
I moved on with my life  
Until she started moving on with hers  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And from the middle to the end  
I only went where she was  
Every kiss on the cheek  
From another mouth made me furious  
And she looked more beautiful  
Every time I saw her  
Jealousy wasn’t just knocking  
It was throwing punches  

[Chorus]  
And I begged to come back  
And she brushed me off  
Said I was single  
I wasn’t single at all  
I begged to come back  
Don’t send me away  
I’m trapped in your life  
It was just temporary freedom  
You’ll have to take me back  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And from the middle to the end  
I only went where she was  
Every kiss on the cheek  
From another mouth made me furious  
And she looked more beautiful  
Every time I saw her  
Jealousy wasn’t just knocking  
It was throwing punches  

[Chorus]  
I begged to come back  
And she brushed me off  
Said I was single  
I wasn’t single at all  
I begged to come back  
Don’t send me away  
I’m trapped in your life  
It was just temporary freedom  
You’ll have to take me back  

[Chorus]  
I begged to come back  
And she brushed me off  
Said I was single  
I wasn’t single at all  
I begged to come back  
Don’t send me away  
I’m trapped in your life  
It was just temporary freedom  
You’ll have to take me back  
You’ll have to take me back
