**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Loves come, loves go  

[Verse]  
I cried too much  
I chased after you  
If I almost died for you  
Today I won’t die anymore  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You know when a leaf falls and another is born  
Remember that after the storm, the sun comes  
What made you think that after you  
No one else would come, huh?  

[Chorus]  
With every mouth my mouth kisses  
With every piece of clothing my clumsy hand removes  
You’re dropping down the ranks  
In the list of loves in my life  
With every mouth my mouth kisses  
With every piece of clothing my clumsy hand removes  
You’re dropping down the ranks  
In the list of loves in my life, oh oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh  

[Verse]  
I cried too much  
I chased after you  
If I almost died for you  
Today I won’t die anymore  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You know when a leaf falls and another is born  
Remember that after the storm, the sun comes  
What made you think that after you  
No one else would come, huh?  

[Chorus]  
With every mouth my mouth kisses  
With every piece of clothing my clumsy hand removes  
You’re dropping down the ranks  
In the list of loves in my life  
With every mouth my mouth kisses  
With every piece of clothing my clumsy hand removes  
You’re dropping down the ranks  
In the list of loves  
With every mouth my mouth kisses (with every mouth)  
With every piece of clothing my clumsy hand removes (with every piece)  
You’re dropping down the ranks  
In the list of loves in my life, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh  

[Outro]  
In the list of loves in my life, oh, oh
