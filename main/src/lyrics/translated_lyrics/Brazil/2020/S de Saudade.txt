**Translated Lyrics:**

Yeah, I gained the freedom to come and go  
But you must have put a curse on me  
I don’t want to drink  
I don’t want to go out  
The single life I dreamed of isn’t like this  

Friday’s here with an S for longing  
Full of parties in the city  
But none of them have the show  
That you gave me in bed  
Not even the DJ plays your voice saying you love me  

Friday’s here with an S for longing  
Full of parties in the city  
But none of them have the show  
That you gave me in bed  
Not even the DJ plays your voice saying you love me  

Friday’s here with an S for longing
