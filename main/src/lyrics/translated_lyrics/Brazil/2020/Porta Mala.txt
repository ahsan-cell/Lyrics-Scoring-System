**Translated Lyrics:**

THEY TRY TO GIVE A FINE, EVEN THE PEN BURSTS  
STOPPED WANTING TO SEARCH THE CAR, FOUND BOTTLES OF VODKA  
YOUR OFFICER CAN FINE ME, I HAVE MONEY THAT WILL NEVER RUN OUT  
I’VE BEEN TO DUBAI, NOW RETURNING TO RIO, I’M GONNA HAVE FUN  
2 CENTIMETERS OFF THE GROUND, I WANT TO SEE THE BASS THUMP

CRY IN THE SHIP, NEIN NEIN, COME ON, I’LL TREAT YOU RIGHT  
CRY IN THE SHIP, CRY SHIP, CRY IN THE SHIP, CRY IN THE SHIP  
THE SHIP AND ITS LITTLE SPOT, COME ON, BRO

I’VE REACHED MY SUCCESS, NO ONE HELPED ME  
TODAY I TOAST TO LOVE, WHAT WAS ONCE A STRUGGLE  
COUNTING DIM DIM (money) WAS NEVER EASY LIKE THIS  
FIRST, I STUDIED TO HAVE SOMETHING LIKE THIS  
NOW MY SHIP IS ON THE GROUND, SCRAPING THE BACK ON THE FLOOR  
THE CROWD IS ALREADY LOOKING AND CALLING ME BOSS  
THE CHAIN ALMOST TOUCHING THE GROUND, STRAIGHT LEG FROM NIKE  
SNEAKERS SHINING ON THE TRUCK, PLAYING HUNGRY HIP HOP AND HUSKY LION BRAND

XENON, 19-INCH RIMS, LEATHER SEATS  
THE LADIES ARE ALREADY COMING WANTING TO TAKE A RIDE IN THE HONDA CIVIC  
I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED AND A LITTLE MORE  
GOLD AND SILVER STAND OUT IN THE NIGHT
