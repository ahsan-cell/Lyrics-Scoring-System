**Translated Lyrics:**

You're back with that person again  
I can't believe it  
Are you really going to play the fool once more?  
You just don't learn  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
To you, this is love  
But to him, it's just a backup plan  
If he doesn't find anyone from his list, he calls you  
Uses you and throws you away  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop insisting, enough with the delusions  
What you're going through, I've been through and I survived  
If he doesn't want you, get over it  
If he doesn't want you, get over it  
He's treating your heart like a doormat  
Promise me this time you'll say no?  
From woman to woman, get over it  
From woman to woman, get over it  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
To you, this is love  
But to him, it's just a backup plan  
If he doesn't find anyone from his list, he calls you  
Uses you and throws you away  

**[Chorus]**  
Stop insisting, enough with the delusions  
What you're going through, I've been through and I survived  
If he doesn't want you, get over it  
If he doesn't want you, get over it  
He's treating your heart like a doormat  
Promise me this time you'll say no?  
From woman to woman, get over it  
From woman to woman, get over it  
If he doesn't want you (Get over it)  
From woman to woman, get over it
