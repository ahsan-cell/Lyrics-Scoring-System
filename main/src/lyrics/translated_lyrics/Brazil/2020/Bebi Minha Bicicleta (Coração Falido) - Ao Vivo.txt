**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I've never seen bad luck like this guy, you know?!

[Verse]  
They cut off my power, I lost my job  
My fridge is just eggs and ice  
After the betrayal she pulled on me  
I’m left with a heart and wallet both empty  
With what happened  
Even a stray bullet has more direction than I do

[Chorus]  
I drank my bicycle  
I drank my TV  
I just won’t drink my phone  
'Cause I need to call you  
I drank my bicycle  
I drank my TV  
I just won’t drink my phone  
'Cause I need to call you  
I drank my bicycle

[Verse]  
They cut off my power, I lost my job  
My fridge is just eggs and ice  
After the betrayal she pulled on me  
I’m left with a heart and wallet both empty  
With what happened  
Even a stray bullet has more direction than I do

[Chorus]  
I drank my bicycle  
I drank my TV  
I just won’t drink my phone  
'Cause I need to call you  
I drank my bicycle  
I drank my TV  
I just won’t drink my phone  
'Cause I need to call you  
I drank my bicycle  
I drank my TV  
I just won’t drink my phone  
'Cause I need to call you  
I drank my bicycle
