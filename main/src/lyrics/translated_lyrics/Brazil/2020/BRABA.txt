**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Sonza, hmm-hmm  

[Verse]  
Let me tell you,  
I'm the kind you can't decipher.  
My balloon has risen, it won't come down,  
I won't stop, I won't stop.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know everyone wants a piece,  
It's just that the girl knows how to please.  
Can't hide it, it's in your gaze,  
If I started, I'll finish this phase.  

[Chorus]  
So come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause the girl is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  
Come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause Luísa is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  
Come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause the girl is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  
Come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause Luísa is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  

[Verse]  
Let me tell you,  
I'm the kind you can't decipher.  
My balloon has risen, it won't come down,  
I won't stop, I won't stop (Go).  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know everyone wants a piece,  
It's just that the girl knows how to please.  
Can't hide it, it's in your gaze,  
If I started, I'll finish this phase.  

[Chorus]  
So come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause the girl is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  
Come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause Luísa is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  
Come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause the girl is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn (Go)  
Come down, I rub it in your face,  
'Cause Luísa is fierce and you're gonna chase.  
Ahn, ahn  
Ahn, ahn
