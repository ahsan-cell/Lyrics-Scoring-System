**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Vytinho NG]  
Vytinho NG  
Hey, Chavoso  
You’re traveling, right, B? (You’re traveling, right, B?)  
So let’s go  

[Verse: Vytinho NG]  
She travels with the crew, the guys who hustle  
Who thrive in the favela, who take but don’t get involved  
She’s from the south side, I’m from the north side  
There’s a party happening, come through, the squad is strong  
There’s a party happening, come through, the squad is strong  

[Chorus: MC Bianca]  
If we call the crew, there’ll be a gathering  
Everything’s on the down-low, everything’s in the plan  
Maybe there’s some balloons, maybe there’s some treats  
I’ll ride the wave, I’ll lose my mind  
On the vibe of the launch, you keep it going  
On the vibe of the thrill, I’m riding the high  
On the vibe of the bold, on the vibe of the bold  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  
On the vibe of the launch, you keep it going  
On the vibe of the thrill, I’m riding the high  
On the vibe of the bold, on the vibe of the bold  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  
On the vibe of the launch, launch, launch, launch, launch  
On the vibe of the thrill, thrill, thrill, thrill, thrill  
On the vibe of the bold, on the vibe of the bold  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  

[Verse: Vytinho NG]  
She travels with the crew, the guys who hustle  
Who thrive in the favela, who take but don’t get involved  
She’s from the south side, I’m from the north side  
There’s a party happening, come through, the squad is strong  
There’s a party happening, come through, the squad is strong  

[Chorus: MC Bianca]  
If we call the crew, there’ll be a gathering  
Everything’s on the down-low, everything’s in the plan  
Maybe there’s some balloons, maybe there’s some treats  
I’ll ride the wave, I’ll lose my mind  
On the vibe of the launch, you keep it going  
On the vibe of the thrill, I’m riding the high  
On the vibe of the bold, on the vibe of the bold  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  
On the vibe of the launch, you keep it going  
On the vibe of the thrill, I’m riding the high  
On the vibe of the bold, on the vibe of the bold  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  
On the vibe of the launch, launch, launch, launch, launch  
On the vibe of the thrill, thrill, thrill, thrill, thrill  
On the vibe of the bold, on the vibe of the bold  
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go, let’s go  

[Outro: Vytinho NG]  
Vytinho NG  
Hey, Chavoso

Another hit that exploded!)
