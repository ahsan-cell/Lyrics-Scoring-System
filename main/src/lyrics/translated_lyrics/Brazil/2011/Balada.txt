**Translated Lyrics:**

When we arrive  
At the party  
Gathering in a circle  
With a bucket of cachaça*  
We go wild when we  
Hit the scene  
Making waves  
In the reserved VIP area  

Chill in the ride  
We step out of the house  
A little trip to the gas station  
Just to check out the ladies  
It’s pretty weak here  
Let’s head to the square’s hotspot  
And to make it better  
We just pop open the trunk  

And then we warm up  
Always before the party  
And the girls go crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy

*Cachaça: A Brazilian spirit made from fermented sugarcane juice, often used in cocktails like caipirinhas.
