**Translated Lyrics:**

I never imagined it would be like this  
What I never thought  
Was having you close to me  

The sun burned my peace  
When you arrived  
You donâ€™t know the good you do for me  
In the shade of this love  

Ocean water  
To drink  
I live submerged in you  
I truly love you  
Remember not to forget
