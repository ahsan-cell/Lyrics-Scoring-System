**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Shakira, El Cata]  
Crazy (Crazy)  
Don't be foolish  
Crazy  
He'll drink you up  
Dance or die  
Crazy (Crazy)  
(Ra-ta-ta)

[Chorus: Shakira]  
He's into me and erased you  
And even though you have everything, I don't have a thing  
He's into me, and erased you (Erased)  
And even though you have everything, I don't have a thing

[Verse 1: Shakira]  
She pretends to be clueless to get attention  
In front of me, she acts like a cat in heat with you  
She whispers in your ear to keep you high  
She’s dying for you, while you’d kill for me  
I stay calm like a pigeon on the corner  
While she drives by in her BMW next to me  
I’m not going anywhere, what’s meant for me  
No one can take it away from me in one go  

[Chorus: Shakira, El Cata]  
I’m crazy for my guy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
I’m crazy for my guy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
I’m crazy for my guy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)  
I’m crazy for my guy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)

[Chorus: Shakira]  
He's into me, and erased you (Erased)  
And even though you have everything, I don't have a thing  
He's into me, and erased you (Erased)  
And even though you have everything, I don't have a thing

[Verse 2: Shakira, El Cata]  
While she caters to all your whims  
I take you to the boardwalk on a little path  
They say your girlfriend's armed with a rifle  
Because she saw me dancing mambo for you, what won’t she allow?  
I’m not to blame if you fall in love  
While he buys you flowers, I buy condoms—oh!  
I’m crazy for my guy  
The more stripes, the better, and that’s what they say (Shhh)

[Chorus: Shakira, El Cata]  
I’m crazy for my guy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
I’m crazy for my guy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
I’m crazy for my guy (Crazy, crazy, crazy)  
I’m crazy for my guy

[Bridge: Shakira, El Cata]  
Oh my God! (Ahh! Ahh!)  
They sneak in the ra-ta-ta  
Don’t be foolish  
He’ll drink you up  
Crazy (Crazy)  
Crazy

[Chorus: Shakira]  
He's into me, and erased you (Erased)  
And even though you have everything, I don't have a thing

[Chorus / Outro: Shakira, El Cata]  
I’m crazy for my guy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
I’m crazy for my guy, crazy, crazy, crazy  
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)  
(Crazy, crazy, crazy)
