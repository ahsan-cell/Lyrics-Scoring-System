**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Paula Fernandes]  
You say you don’t need  
To live dreaming so much  
That I do too much  
For you

[Verse 2: Paula Fernandes]  
You say you don’t need  
Every time I sing  
One more song for you

[Chorus: Paula Fernandes]  
But it has to be this way  
To come from the heart  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"  
It has to be this way  
It’s your heart, my love  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"

[Verse 3: Victor & Leo]  
I’ve already dreamed of life  
Now I live a dream  
But living or dreaming  
With you, it’s all the same

[Verse 4: Victor & Leo]  
Don’t say "you don’t need to"  
I say it’s necessary  
We need to love each other so much  
Nothing more

[Chorus: Victor & Leo]  
But it has to be this way  
To come from the heart  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"  
It has to be this way  
It’s your heart, my love  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"

[Verse 3: Paula Fernandes]  
I’ve already dreamed of life  
Now I live a dream  
But living or dreaming  
With you, it’s all the same

[Verse 4: Victor & Leo]  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"  
I say it’s necessary  
We need to love each other so much  
Nothing more

[Chorus: Paula Fernandes and Victor & Leo]  
But it has to be this way  
To come from the heart  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"  
It has to be this way  
It’s your heart, my love  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"

[Chorus: Paula Fernandes and Victor & Leo]  
But it has to be this way  
To come from the heart  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"  
It has to be this way  
It’s your heart, my love  
Don’t say: "you don’t need to"
