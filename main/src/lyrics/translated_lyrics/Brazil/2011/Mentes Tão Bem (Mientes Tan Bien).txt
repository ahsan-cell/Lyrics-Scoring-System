**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
You promise me sincere love, a lifetime ahead  
With you, my winter turns into spring instead  
You keep swearing that you're in love with me  
Promised me the world, but gave nothing, you see  
You never keep your word  

**[Verse 2]**  
If I follow your path, I’ll reach the sky  
But I taste the bitter of your sweet lie  
In the deceit of your words, I play your game  
Searching for water, only find the flame  
And I burn in that fire  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
When you speak so passionately  
"My love, I will always be with you"  
I look into your eyes, get moved and cry  
I know it’s a lie, but I feel alive  
Even if the air is false, I feel I breathe  

**[Chorus]**  
You lie so well  
It seems like the truth  
What you tell me  
I start believing  
You lie so well  
That I even imagine  
You don’t want to deceive me  
That you truly love me  
Hmm... You lie so well  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
When you speak so passionately  
"My love, I will always be with you"  
I look into your eyes, get moved and cry  
I know it’s a lie, but I feel alive  
Even if the air is false, I feel I breathe  

**[Chorus]**  
You lie so well  
It seems like the truth  
What you tell me  
I start believing  
You lie so well  
That I even imagine  
You don’t want to deceive me  
That you truly love me  
Hmm... You lie so well  

**[Outro]**  
You don’t truly love me  
You lie so well
