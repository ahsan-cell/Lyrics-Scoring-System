**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Hanna Nicole]  
Your words say you're hiding something from me  
I know it when those eyes start to fill up  
You know that if you cry, you win my weakness  

[Verse 2: Ashley Grace]  
How many times have I heard this part  
It hurts every time I try to decipher you  
You only regret it when you want to come back  

[Pre-Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]  
You're not perfect, I already know  
That’s not what made me fall for you  
It's your way of pretending nothing's wrong while disappointing me  
You drowned me, and now  

[Chorus: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]  
You see, this was the last time  
Because your apologies no longer touch me  
You slip away from my skin  
Because your tears no longer wet me  
I'm tired of forgiving you  
I won't love you again  
Today, I'm waterproof  

[Verse 3: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]  
Your words rain down, the same old routine  
The same one that leaves us with no way out today  
But those lips can’t deceive me anymore  

[Pre-Chorus: Ashley Grace & Hanna Nicole]  
You're not perfect, I already know  
That’s not what made me fall for you  
It's your way of pretending nothing's wrong while disappointing me  
You drowned me, and now  

[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]  
You see, this was the last time  
Because your apologies no longer touch me  
You slip away from my skin  
Because your tears no longer wet me  
I'm tired of forgiving you  
I won't love you again  
Today, I'm waterproof  

[Chorus: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]  
You see, this was the last time  
Because your apologies no longer touch me  
You slip away from my skin  
Because your tears no longer wet me  
I'm tired of forgiving you  
I won't love you again  
Today, I'm waterproof  
Nara Nara  
Nara Nara  

[Outro: Hanna Nicole & Ashley Grace]  
You see, this was the last time  
Because your apologies no longer touch me (no longer touch me)  
You slip away from my skin  
Because your tears no longer wet me  
I'm tired of forgiving you (I'm tired of forgiving you)  
I'll stay close to you  
I won't love you again  
I won't love you again  
Today, I'm waterproof
