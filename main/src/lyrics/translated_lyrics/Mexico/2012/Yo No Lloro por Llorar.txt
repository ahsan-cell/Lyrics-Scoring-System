**Translated Lyrics:**

It's not for anything special  
I don't cry just to cry  
It's for everything I've lost  
No  
It's not for anything special  
It's for everything in general  
Because I was never loved  
If I made mistakes  
I paid for them twice  
What I received  
I returned with interest  
If I ever fell in love  
I was never cherished like the others  
If I planted roses  
I got the thorns but nothing more  
If I ever fell in love  
I was never cherished like the others  
If I planted roses  
I got the thorns but nothing more  
No  
It's not for anything special  
It's for everything in general  
Because I was never loved  
If I made mistakes  
I paid for them twice  
What I received  
I returned with interest  
If I ever fell in love  
I was never cherished like the others  
If I planted roses  
I got the thorns but nothing more  
If I ever fell in love  
I was never cherished like the others  
If I planted roses  
I got the thorns but nothing more  
No, no  
NO, no, no, no, no  
UAaa  
Oouae  
Never  
Never, never like...  
The others
