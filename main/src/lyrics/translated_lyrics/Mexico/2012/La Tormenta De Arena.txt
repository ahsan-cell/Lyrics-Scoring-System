**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I've lost you among the crowd  
I've adored you and I've hated you  
And deep down you know well  
That in the worst moments  
You carry within an angel of darkness  
That drags us both down  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the new day arrives  
You swear that you would change, yes  
But you fall again  
Everything will hurt your body  
You'll search for me in hell  
Because I'm just like you  

[Chorus]  
Everything I feel for you  
I could only say it this way  
Everything I feel for you  
I would only know how to say it this way; -í, -í, -í, -í  

[Verse 2]  
To travel to other planets  
Through circular currents  
I gave you a special capsule  
But now your mind  
Is a sandstorm  
And every night a spiral  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And when the new day arrives  
You swear that you would change, yes  
But you fall again  
Everything will hurt your body  
You'll search for me in hell  
Because I'm just like you  

[Chorus]  
Everything I feel for you  
I could only say it this way  
Everything I feel for you  
I would only know how to say it this way; -í, -í, -í, -í  

[Bridge]  
Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh... ahhh...  
Ahhh... ahhh... ahhh... ahhh...  
Ah-ah-ah-ah  

[Chorus]  
Everything I feel for you  
I could only say it this way  
Everything I feel for you  
I would only know how to say it this way  
Everything I feel for you  
I could only say it this way  
Everything I feel for you  
I would only know how to say it this way
