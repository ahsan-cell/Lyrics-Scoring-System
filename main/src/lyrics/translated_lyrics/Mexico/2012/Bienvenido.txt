**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
To you who lose your way back home,  
Yet go where your feet take you, there you are.  
I see the freedom of your shoes splashing,  
Those who speak hurtful words because  
Perhaps they don’t know how to understand  
The one who pleaded and was forgotten in a moment.

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
To the one you have no secrets to confide,  
Who offers lies without end,  
To the one who doesn’t ask for forgiveness, yet will have it.

[Chorus 1]  
Welcome the tears and their comfort,  
And the omen of snow in the sky.  
Welcome the one who smiles,  
Who stumbles and continues, and the one who always gives good advice.  
Welcome to a train that sails the seas  
And unites us in time during Christmas.  
Welcome the artists, all their passions,  
Welcome the one who won’t change what we are today.

[Verse 2]  
To this moon that will make dreams come true,  
Or disguises them as opportunities.  
To the one who painted their wait at a traffic light.

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
And welcome this long winter,  
If it helps us to improve,  
And to those who have the courage to take risks.

[Chorus 2]  
Welcome the tears and their comfort,  
And the omen of snow in the sky.  
Welcome the one who doubts,  
Who undresses because they want to or out of necessity.  
Welcome to the wedding night  
And the moment of being alone together.  
Welcome is the pianist, all his songs,  
The chords that reflect what we are today.

[Bridge]  
What’s missing? What will come?  
From all this, what will come?  
From all this, what will be?  
Perhaps (stop)

[Chorus 3]  
Welcome the tears and their comfort,  
And the omen of snow in the sky.  
Welcome the one who smiles,  
Who gets scared and falls but without despair.  
Welcome to a train that sails the seas,  
The one that unites us in time during Christmas.  
Welcome the artists with their intuitions,  
Welcome what we are today,  
What we are today.  
I’m not leaving from here,  
Because we are today,  
What we are today.
