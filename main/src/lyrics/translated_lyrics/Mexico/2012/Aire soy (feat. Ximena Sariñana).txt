**Translated Lyrics:**

Almost without wanting,  
It slips away from me, it clouds my mind, it never ends.  
Almost without wanting,  
There’s nothing left,  
There’s nothing left.  

To touch you inside, to kiss,  
There was never and there will never be,  
There’s nothing here now.  
To fly away and at the same time soar,  
I am air and to the air,  
The wind no, the wind, the wind no,  
For without you, I am nobody.  
Without you, I’m not, without you, without you, I’m not.  

An escape, an SOS, a stop,  
Almost without wanting,  
And doubt transformed into feeling,  
Almost without wanting,  
There’s nothing left,  
There’s nothing left.  

So beautiful it is to fall at your feet,  
There was never and there will never be,  
There’s nothing here now.  
Whose sky is this, whose?  
I am air and to the air,  
The wind no, the wind, the wind no,  
For without you, I am nobody.  
Without you, I’m not, without you, without you, I’m not.  

There’s nothing left,  
There’s nothing left.  
So beautiful it is to fall at your feet,  
There was never and there will never be,  
There’s nothing here now.  
Whose sky is this, whose?  
I am air and to the air,  
The wind no, the wind, the wind no,  
For without you, I am nobody.  
Without you, I’m not, without you, without you, I’m not.  

I’m not, I’m not, I’m not,  
I’m not, I’m not, I’m not,  
I’m not, I’m not, I’m not.
