**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
He left me, and I wanted to do it, damn it  
That's me, the one who puts up with jerks for being so good  

[Pre-Chorus]  
(Uh-uh)  
For a while, I want to be single  
(Mmm, mmm)  
My friends scold me  
Because I fall for anyone, oh-oh  

[Chorus]  
And then you appeared to change my luck  
I'm already enchanted to meet you  
Tell me everything, nothing about you bores me  
I want to love you, I'm addicted to love  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh  

[Verse 2]  
I'll tell you that your bad reputation doesn't bother me at all  
I warn you that I'm a promise of a lot of drama  

[Pre-Chorus]  
(Uh-uh)  
I've never been very romantic  
(Mmm, mmm)  
But I need your hugs and practice kisses  

[Chorus]  
And then you appeared to change my luck  
I'm already enchanted to meet you  
Tell me everything, nothing about you bores me  
I want to love you, I'm addicted to love  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh  
And then you appeared to change my luck  
I'm already enchanted to meet you  
Tell me everything, nothing about you bores me  
I want to love you, I'm addicted to love  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh  

[Bridge]  
I've never been very romantic  
But I need your hugs  
Oh-woah-oh  

[Chorus]  
And then you appeared to change my luck  
I'm already enchanted to meet you  
Tell me everything, nothing about you bores me  
I want to love you, oh  
And then you appeared to change my luck  
I'm already enchanted to meet you  
Tell me everything, nothing, na-na-da-ra  
I want to love you, I'm addicted to love  

[Outro]  
Woah-oh, woah-oh  
I'm addicted to love  
Woah-oh, woah-oh  
I'm addicted to love  
You appeared  
Woah-oh, woah-oh  
To change my luck  
Woah-oh, woah-oh  
You appeared  
Woah-oh, woah-oh  
To change my luck  
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh
