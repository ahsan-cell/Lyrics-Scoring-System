**Translated Lyrics:**

I feel my breath  
More than accelerated  
Almost on autopilot  

Fragility when you leave  
The rays of the sun melt away  
Polar wind  
My heart freezes  

Cold, cold, cold  
If I don’t have you by my side  
There’s a winter inside me  
Cold, cold, cold  
It’s so harsh and ruthless  
It’s a devastating glacier  
Come fill me with your love  
To melt my heart  
Everything turns to ice  
If I don’t have your warmth  

I feel in your gaze  
Something so electric  
It’s a spark  
That activates this engine  

Fragility when you leave  
The rays of the sun melt away  
Polar wind  
My heart freezes  

Cold, cold, cold  
If I don’t have you by my side  
There’s a winter inside me  
Cold, cold, cold  
It’s so harsh and ruthless  
It’s a devastating glacier  
Come fill me with your love  
To melt my heart  
Everything turns to ice  
If I don’t have your warmth  

The fire of your voice  
Your warm kiss  
Unfreezes my heart  
Melt me with your love  

Cold, cold, cold  
If I don’t have you by my side  
There’s a winter inside me  
Cold, cold, cold  
It’s so harsh and ruthless  
It’s a devastating glacier  
Come fill me with your love  
To melt my heart  
Everything turns to ice  
If I don’t have your warmth  
I don’t have your warmth  

Come fill me with your love  
To melt my heart  
Everything turns to ice  
If I don’t have your warmth
