**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
An empty swing flies above my head  
It soars through the cemetery of my will  
I keep searching for the girl who cries at your parties  
Bells ring in bloom for my funeral  

[Chorus]  
Look at me with the North Star at my feet  
I return home lost once again  
Because I can't stop adoring you  
Look at me  

[Verse 2]  
An empty swing flies brushing the sand  
Leaving the traces of the fallen angel as it passes  
Footprints that always lead me to you, worry-easer  
Like the fleeting dose of life you let me taste  

[Chorus]  
Look at me with the North Star at my feet  
I return home lost once again  
Because I can't stop adoring you  

[Bridge]  
I think of you every time I drift away from myself  
Every time I choose to die  
Since the day you told me  
"Your little face is a rose yet to bloom"  

[Chorus]  
Look at me with the North Star at my feet  
I return home lost once again  
Because I can't stop adoring you  
Think of me every time you look at me like that  
My lips sew themselves to you  
And the moon paints my eyes  

[Outro]  
Look at me, every time you leave I think of you  
Every time I choose to die  
Every time you kiss me like that  
Every time you go, look at me
