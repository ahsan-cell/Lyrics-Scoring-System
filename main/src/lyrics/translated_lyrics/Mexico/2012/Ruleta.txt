**Translated Lyrics:**

Will I fall in love?
Will you be the one to win me over?
With you, everything in me weakens
Could it be that you're the one?
The one who will erase my past
My heart is healing for you

And it starts to spin
I let myself be carried away
By this roulette of love, and I don’t
I don’t know what will happen
If you come or if you go
If you’re by my side, my love, what does it matter?

La lara la la!

I know you have what I want
And I’m more eager than afraid
A kiss from you is my medicine
Today I want to start from scratch
Your eyes give me something new
My heart spins night and day

And it starts to spin
I let myself be carried away
By this roulette of love, and I don’t
I don’t know what will happen
If you come or if you go
If you’re by my side, my love, what does it matter?

La lara la la! (x4)

And it starts to spin
I let myself be carried away
By this roulette of love, and I don’t
I don’t know what will happen
If you come or if you go
If you’re by my side, my love, what does it matter?

I wrote you this song
Knowing that you
Don’t know about music, what irony
I don’t know what will happen
If you come or if you go
If you’re by my side, my love, what does it matter?

La lara la la! (x4)

By this roulette of love that will spin
