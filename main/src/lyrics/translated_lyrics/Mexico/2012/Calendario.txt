**Translated Lyrics:**

There’s no clock or calendar  
No shoes or alarm clock  
It’s always an anniversary  
I search through alphabets for a thousand reasons  
To celebrate you and me  
I’ll draw our promises in the sand  
With marks that the sea will never erase  
And at night we’ll burn in the bonfire  
The wishes that will come true for us  

No need to use so many words anymore  
For we’ll have a thousand glances  
That speak from the heart  
No more goodbyes or tears are needed  
It’s the way to change the world for the two of us  

In my imaginary world  
Every month there’s a salary  
Made of cotton caresses  
And though it’s not conventional  
You’ve filled out the form  
That grants you total access to my love  

And we’ll travel above borders  
Almost able to touch the sun  
And we’ll swim with dolphins and mermaids  
In this world that I’ll create for us  

No need to use so many words anymore  
For we’ll have a thousand glances  
That speak from the heart  
No more goodbyes or tears are needed  
It’s the way to change the world for the two of us  

No need to use so many words anymore  
For we’ll have a thousand glances  
That speak from the heart  
No more goodbyes or tears are needed  
It’s the way to change the world for the two of us
