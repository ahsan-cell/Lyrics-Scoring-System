**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I couldn't take a critical distance  
I make the same mistake, the typical story  
And in an irrational electric impulse  
My heart runs in your direction  
Your erratic mood hurts me so much  
I follow you without thinking, on autopilot  
If I take one more step, I won't be able to turn back  
I don't know how to retreat, time and again  
I have to fight with myself  
Ah, ah, auh  

[Chorus]  
I live in danger once again  
I run along the line of fire  
You kiss me and I fall into your game  
In danger of falling  
In your voice, I'm lost  
I don't hear my sixth sense  

[Post-Chorus]  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Ah, ah, auh  

[Verse 2]  
You use your hypnotic voice against me  
Once again, I go to you, it makes no sense  
I don't know how to cross a labyrinth that I built  
I want to get out of here, time and again  
I stumble upon you again  

[Chorus]  
I live in danger once again  
I run along the line of fire  
You kiss me and I fall into your game  
In danger of falling  
In your voice, I'm lost  
I don't hear my sixth sense  
Danger once again  
I run along the line of fire  
You kiss me and I fall into your game  
In danger of falling  
In your voice, I'm lost  
I don't hear my sixth sense  

[Post-Chorus]  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Ah, ah, auh  

[Bridge]  
(Woh, oh-oh, oh)  
(Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh)  
(Woh, oh-oh, oh)  
Woh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  
(Woh, oh-oh, oh)  
(Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh)  
Woh, oh-oh  

[Chorus]  
I live in danger once again  
I run along the line of fire  
You kiss me and I fall into your game  
In danger of falling  
In your voice, I'm lost  
I don't hear my sixth sense  
Danger once again  
I run along the line of fire  
You kiss me and I fall into your game  
In danger of falling  
In your voice, I'm lost  
I don't hear my sixth sense  

[Post-Chorus]  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Woh, oh-oh, oh  
Woh, oh-oh, woh, oh-oh  
Ah, ah, auh
