**Translated Lyrics:**

I don't believe in coincidence  
We walk on burning lava  
And together we enter the volcano  
In a sigh  
You take everything I was  
I'm lost  
And I don't want to leave you  

Each kiss becomes eternal  
On your lips, time stands still  
The beauty marks on your body  
I wouldn't trade for all the universe  

And wherever you are  
I will follow you  
And even if  
The world ends  
Hanging from a star, I will love you  
Oh oh oh... (4 times)  

You pulled me from this deep dream  
You taught me how to wake up  
You found that hidden wound  
That no one else could heal  

In a sigh  
You take everything I was  
I'm lost  
And I don't want to leave you  

Each kiss becomes eternal  
On your lips, time stands still  
The beauty marks on your body  
I wouldn't trade for all the universe  

And wherever you are  
I will follow you  
And even if  
The world ends  
Hanging from a star, I will love you  

Each kiss becomes eternal  
On your lips, time stands still  
And wherever you are  
I will follow you  
And even if  
The world ends  
Hanging from a star, I will love you  
Oh oh oh
