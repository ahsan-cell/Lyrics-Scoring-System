**Translated Lyrics:**

And you convince yourself that this will end, you're mistaken...  
Your role is to be that woman he grew tired of seeing,  
Who he no longer touches, who he no longer wants...

Meanwhile, I have his nights and his passion,  
His fantasies and his obsession, though it hurts you, I am  
The one who tasted his love in your bed, you are routine,  
That's why I prefer to be his lover, his lover...

Intuition doesn't lie when you feel jealousy,  
You're not crazy, and just so you know, I am the other...  
He's already bored with you, and he chases me like  
A child, I'm a sweet treat that always pleases him...

Meanwhile, I have his nights and his passion,  
His fantasies and his obsession, though it hurts you, I am  
The one who tasted his love in your bed, you are routine,  
That's why I prefer to be his lover, his lover...

I have his nights and his passion,  
His fantasies and his obsession, though it hurts you, I am  
The one who tasted his love in your bed, you are routine,  
That's why I prefer to be his lover, his lover...

I have his nights and his passion,  
His fantasies and his obsession, though it hurts you...
