**Translated Lyrics:**

Like two of a kind  
You fly so high  
I start to soar  
But we are human  
And dreaming is allowed  
I dreamed you were  
My ideal partner  
And against what the whole world may think  
Today you and I are one  
And that's how we'll stay  

Because when you truly love  
Distance doesn't matter  
I've crossed social lines  
The only thing that matters is kissing and sincerity  
With you, fidelity is so easy  
When you truly love  
What others say  
Doesn't matter at all  
Remember that in the heart  
Just like in our room, only love rules  

My passion is to care for you  
My mission is to make  
You love me, awake or asleep  
And see me with every dawn  
And since we're talking  
I want to take this chance  
To tell you that this, truly  
I've never felt before  

Because when you truly love  
Distance doesn't matter  
I've crossed social lines  
The only thing that matters is kissing and sincerity  
With you, fidelity is so easy  
When you truly love  
What others say  
Doesn't matter at all  
Remember that in the heart  
Just like in our room, only love rules  

When you truly love  
Distance doesn't matter  
I've crossed social lines  
The only thing that matters is kissing and sincerity  
With you, fidelity is so easy  
I truly love you  
What others say  
Doesn't matter at all  
Remember that in the heart  
Just like in our room, only love rules
