[Intro]  
(3BallMTY)

[Verse 1: América Sierra]  
I kissed your lips, I kissed your forehead  
I kissed your neck, and your body too  
So gently (Gently)  
So many times I brushed my lips side to side  
From top to bottom, I touched your skin  
And one day you left without saying goodbye  

[Pre-Chorus: América Sierra]  
I didn’t know what I was losing  
And I punish myself every day  
For not having you (For not having you)  
Today I only live on your memory  
I just sigh, for I have lost you  
Now I know  
And one day you left without saying goodbye  

[Chorus: América Sierra]  
Today I only blow kisses to the air  
(I’m dying to touch you)  
Today I only blow kisses to the air  
(How I wish I could caress you)  

[Post-Chorus: América Sierra]  
You’re no longer interested in me, you don’t miss me  
You don’t even want to look at me, or look at me  
With a kiss, I tasted  
The temptations of other lips  
And you’ve never forgiven the betrayals  
Look now  
For having been a coward  
Instead of kissing you  
I only blow kisses to the air  

[Interlude]

[Verse 2: Smoky]  
We both know you were wrong  
You were the one who clipped the wings of this love  
Just for that betrayal  
That broke my heart in two  
Oh, I don’t know what will happen with you  
I just tell you, darling  
That I don’t want to look at you anymore  

[Pre-Chorus: América Sierra]  
I didn’t know what I was losing  
And I punish myself every day  
For not having you (For not having you)  
Today I only live on your memory  
I just sigh, for I have lost you  
Now I know  
And one day you left without saying goodbye  

[Chorus: América Sierra]  
Today I only blow kisses to the air  
(I’m dying to touch you)  
Today I only blow kisses to the air  
(How I wish I could caress you)  

[Post-Chorus: América Sierra]  
You’re no longer interested in me, you don’t miss me  
You don’t even want to look at me, or look at me  
With a kiss, I tasted  
The temptations of other lips  
And you’ve never forgiven the betrayals  
Look now  
For having been a coward  
Instead of kissing you  
I only blow kisses to the air  

[Verse 3: Smoky]  
Yes, I once told you “I love you”  
I offered you sincere affection  
And what happened? Temptation won you over  
And you broke my heart in two  
Oh, I don’t know what will happen with you  
I just tell you, darling  
That I don’t want to look at you anymore (I don’t want to look at you)  

[Outro: América Sierra, Smoky]  
Today I only blow kisses to the air (I don’t want to look at you)  
Kisses to the air, kisses to the air, kisses to the air  
Kisses to the air, kisses to the air, kisses to the air  
Kisses to the air, kisses to the air, kisses to the air  
Be-be-be
