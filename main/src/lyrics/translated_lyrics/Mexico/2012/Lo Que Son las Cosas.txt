**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I know you’re not happy  
That you’re not doing well  
That you’ve thought about coming back  
I know it didn’t work out  
You and your new love  
Oh, the things that happen  

What can I say?  
Nothing in my favor  
If love left with you  
I, just like you  
Have never forgotten you  
Oh, the things that happen  

[Chorus]  
This life without you is nothing  
This life if you’re not here  
It’s desperate, it’s wrong  
Without your love  

[Verse 2]  
I know you didn’t care  
And when you left here  
Your goodbye left me crying  
I know I love you more  
Than I did a year ago  
Oh, the things that happen  

[Chorus]  
This life without you is nothing  
This life if you’re not here  
It’s desperate, it’s wrong  
Without your love  

[Chorus]  
This life without you is nothing  
This life if you’re not here  
It’s desperate, it’s wrong  
Without your love  

[Outro]  
If you’re not here  
It’s desperate, it’s wrong  
Without your love
