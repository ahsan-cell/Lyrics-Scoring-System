**Translated Lyrics:**

Don’t search for words  
I invite you to fly  
All around the city  
Steal my gaze  
Take my hand gently  
And brush  
Your lips against my love  

Hang a star from the heart  
And give me a kiss that ignites with the sun  
Our gazes will rise  
To new skies that will cover us  

You have all that magic  
Fire in your eyes  
You are my other half  
Suddenly you arrive and catch me  
You fill me with calm  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Now  

We’re driving  
Together on a path  
With no final destination  
Without stopping, without thinking  
We are a force  
We are the wall  
A shout of light  
That fades in the voice  

Hang a star from the heart  
And give me a kiss that ignites with the sun  
Our gazes will rise  
To new skies that will cover us  

You have all that magic  
Fire in your eyes  
You are my other half  
Suddenly you arrive and catch me  
You fill me with calm  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Now  

There’s a pulse in my heart  
Something inside me  
A neon beacon  
Of love  
I want to have you  
Never leave me  
You have all that magic  
Fire in your eyes  
You are my other half  
Suddenly you arrive and catch me  
You fill me with calm  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Now  

You have all that magic  
Fire in your eyes  
You are my other half  
Suddenly you arrive and catch me  
You fill me with calm  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Now  

Nothing's Gonna Stop Us  
Now
