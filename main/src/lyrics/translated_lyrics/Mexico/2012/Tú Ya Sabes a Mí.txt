**Translated Lyrics:**

I'm going to enter your dreams  
My ghost will chase you down  
Even if you run very, very far  

I won't let you feel  
Because your skin is already mine  
And I’ll let you get to know  
But not let you melt away  

I found out  
That you're seeing someone else  
And I won’t move from here  
But my memory,  
Surely it will linger  

And I’ll get in the way  
When you want to kiss their lips  
And I’ll be a bother  
When you try to make love  

And my name you'll think of  
Every time it leaves your mouth  
An "I love you"  

Right in the middle of us  
I will live, and in the end  
You’ll always come back here  
For so many kisses I gave you  
That you already know me  

I’ll always be watching you  
My voice near your bed  
Every time you undress  
I’ll scratch your back  

I found out that you’re  
Seeing someone else  
And I won’t move from here  
But my memory,  
Surely it will linger  

And I’ll get in the way  
When you want to kiss their lips  
And I’ll be a bother  
When you try to make love  

And my name you'll think of  
Every time it leaves your mouth  
An "I love you"  

Right in the middle of us  
I will live  
Right in the middle of us  
I will live  
If I were you, I wouldn’t waste  
Any more time, my love  
You only love once in this life  
Realize that it’s me  

And I’ll get in the way  
When you want to kiss their lips  
And I’ll be a bother  
When you try to make love  

And my name you'll think of  
Every time it leaves your mouth  
An "I love you"  

Right in the middle of us, I will live  
And in the end, you’ll always come back here  
For so many kisses I gave you  
That you already know me  

You already know me  
You already know me
