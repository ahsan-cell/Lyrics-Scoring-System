**Translated Lyrics:**

Now that the rocking chair creaks  
And there's snow on the TV  
Now that it rains in the living room and the candles  
Of a sky that once lit me up go out  
Now that the slow ones are running,  
Spilling trova* and the world, ring, ring, woke up  
Now that a fierce silence thunders, now we catch a cough  
Now that we've found the time  
We can look at each other beyond the resentment  
Now I’ll show you where I come from  
And the broken pieces of the engine  
Now that I find my harbor  
Now I find your fierce doubt  
Now I’ll show you where I come from  
And what my heart is made of  

**[Chorus]**  
I come from the air  
That dried your skin, my love  
I am the street where you found him  
Don’t compare me  
I came down to earth on a brush for you  
Unforgivable, that I don’t resemble him  
Neither him, nor anyone  

**[Verse 2]**  
Now that the cats jump  
Looking for scraps, you meow the sad song  
Now that you’ve run out of words  
You compare, compare, with so much passion  
Now we can look at each other without fear  
At the reflection in the rearview mirror  
Now I’ll show you where I come from  
And the wounds that love left me  
Now I don’t want any fuss  
Just a quiet chat between us  
If you want, I’ll tell you why I love you  
And if you want, I’ll tell you why I don’t  

**[Chorus]**  

**[Verse 3]**  
Let someone dry me from your skin, my love  
Let them unpin us  
And erase you from my temple  
Don’t talk to me  
Let someone dry me from your skin, my love  
Let them unpin us  
I am your soul, you are my air  

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t compare me  

**[Chorus 2] [x2]**  
Let them separate us, if they can  
Let them separate us, let them try  
Let them separate us, let them try  
I am your soul and you are my luck
