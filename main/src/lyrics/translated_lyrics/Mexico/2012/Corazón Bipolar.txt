**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Friday I wake up, my head is pounding  
The hangover weighs on me, both physical and moral  
Because you left me in a bad way  
Because without your love, I'm doing terribly, uh-huh  
Time passes so slowly  
Feelings attack me  
You’re not coming for me, and I want to call you  
But I won’t do it  
Today my pride will rescue me, uh-huh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m a wreck, even the mirror calls me out  
But I’d rather die than let you see me like this  
But I’m fine, I’ll be okay  
I want to be, yes, yes, I know I will  

[Chorus]  
No, bipolar heart  
Because I laugh first and then I have to cry  
Because the reality is that I say I don’t love you  
And I want to come back  

[Post-Chorus]  
Na-na-ra-na-ra-na-na  
What’s the ending?  

[Verse 2]  
And the best part is that when I remember you  
I recall the bad more than the good  
You left me in a bad way  
It’s just that without your love, I’m doing terribly, uh-huh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m a wreck, even the mirror calls me out  
But I’d rather die than let you see me like this  
But I’m fine, I’ll be okay  
I want to be, yes, yes, I know I will  

[Chorus]  
No, bipolar heart  
Because I laugh first and then I have to cry  
Because the reality is that I say I don’t love you  
And I want to come back  

[Post-Chorus]  
Na-na-ra-na-ra-na-na  
What’s the ending?  

[Bridge]  
I blame the soap operas, curse their plot  
How stupid it is to cry and how cheesy what I feel  
To believe you’ll return right at the final chapter, uh-huh  

[Chorus]  
No, bipolar heart  
Because I laugh first and then I have to cry  
Because the reality is that I say I don’t love you  
And I want to come back  

[Outro]  
Na-na-ra-na-ra-na-na  
Na-na-ra-na-ra-na-na  
I don’t love you and I want to re-  
I don’t love you and I want to come back  
What’s the ending?
