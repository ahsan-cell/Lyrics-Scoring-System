**Translated Lyrics:**

I can be anyone  
A lonely fool in the sun  
Your heartbeat is solid gold  
I love you, you'll never know  
When the daylight comes, you'll feel so cold, you know  
I'm so afraid of my heart letting you go  

**[Chorus]**  
Waiting for the fire to ignite  
Feeling like we could do what's right  
Be the one who makes this night  
'Cause freedom is a lonely road  
We're in control  
We're in control  

**[Verse 2]**  
I can be anyone  
A lonely fool in the sun  
Your heartbeat is solid gold  
I love you, you'll never know  
When the daylight comes, you'll feel so cold, you know  
I'm so afraid of my heart letting you go  

**[Chorus]**  
Waiting for the fire to ignite  
Feeling like we could do what's right  
Be the one who makes this night  
'Cause freedom is a lonely road  
We're in control  
Waiting for the fire to ignite  
Feeling like we could do what's right  
Be the one who makes this night  
'Cause freedom is a lonely road  
We're in control  
We're in control
