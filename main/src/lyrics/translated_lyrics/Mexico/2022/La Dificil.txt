**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: J Alvarez & Voltio]**  
She plays hard to get  
But what’s mine is secured by law  
Baby, don’t hold back, the night is short (Julio Voltio "El Chamaco")  
And with me, you’re going all day (J Alvarez)  
She plays hard to get  
But what’s mine is secured by law (By law)  
It’s just that with me, she won’t resist (You know how it is, baby)  
She has a few drinks and then she’s ready to ignite  

**[Post-Chorus: J Alvarez & Voltio]**  
I’m going to take you (We’re off under)  
No need for anything else (Don’t hold back), uh-uh  
Hey, baby  
The night is perfect for some mischief (Let’s do it), so tonight you’ll be my lady  

**[Verse 1: Voltio]**  
She’s in a haze, wild, that’s mine no matter what  
I saw her at the party and she clouded my vision  
She wants punishment, rough play, I’ll definitely take her down  
She’s looking for a cat, and that cat is me  
Come on, relax, you know what’s about to happen  
Since she steps out to the club, she’s all about the thrill  
My style, my vibe, my scent heats her up  
Tonight, she’s going with me by legend  
Baby, you’re going to be my lady  
Let’s take it slow, easy, you’re my little kitty, my sweetie  
With me, you’ll go easily, don’t resist  
Come on, don’t play hard to get  

**[Bridge: J Alvarez & Voltio]**  
No, oh, oh, wow-wow  
Baby, just chill, relax, no pressure  
No, oh, oh, wow-wow  
Tonight is just for fun, not for getting tangled up  

**[Chorus: J Alvarez]**  
She plays hard to get  
But what’s mine is secured by law  
Baby, don’t hold back, the night is short  
And with me, you’re going all day  
She plays hard to get  
But what’s mine is secured by law  
It’s just that with me, she won’t resist  
She has a few drinks and then she’s ready to ignite  

**[Verse 2: J Alvarez]**  
What’s mine is secure, babe, I don’t have to stress  
What she’s wearing, I’m going to enjoy  
That’s only mine, and no one else’s  
I get close with Carmona and make her sweat  
Forward, forward, like Omega says  
This is good stuff, and my girl will surrender anywhere  
Tell me, dark-skinned beauty  
If we leave here and make this night pleasurable  

**[Bridge: J Alvarez & Voltio]**  
No, oh, oh, wow-wow  
Baby, just chill, relax, no pressure  
No, oh, oh, wow-wow  
Tonight is just for fun, not for getting tangled up  

**[Chorus: J Alvarez]**  
She plays hard to get  
But what’s mine is secured by law  
Baby, don’t hold back, the night is short  
And with me, you’re going all day  
She plays hard to get  
But what’s mine is secured by law  
It’s just that with me, she won’t resist  
She has a few drinks and then she’s ready to ignite  

**[Post-Chorus: J Alvarez]**  
I’m going to take you  
No need for anything else, uh-uh  
Hey, baby  
The night is perfect for some mischief, so tonight you’ll be my lady  

**[Outro: Voltio]**
