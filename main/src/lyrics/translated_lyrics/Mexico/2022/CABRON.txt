**[Intro]**  
Feeling, in the strictly physiological order  
It's the action and effect of feeling or being felt  
It's the state of consciousness, endowed with emotional tone  
And with characteristics of certain duration and meaning (Haha!)

**[Verse 1]**  
I thank God for filling my pockets (Yeah!)  
And blessing me, also my crew (Ouh!)  
I'm going to Spain, having roast suckling pig for dinner  
I rent out the whole hotel, I own the hallway (Prrra!)  
Their envy is so great, they want to sue me for my money  
Don't call me this weekend, I went to Switzerland to deposit  
Lero lero, lero euro, Francs, Pounds, and Euros  
I have a couple of dollars, which I usually use as petty cash  
From counting money so much, I've got a rash on my hand  
Fast cash, quick money  
International women, asking for a whip  
I'm not dead yet, I've got a crazy flow  
Soon we'll have a concert in Japan  
And it smells to me, partner, that if I keep rising  
I'll soon be touring Pluto (Haha!)  
I've got my respect, my bills paid, I've got everything set  
And on the jet, the air feels better  
My God blessed, living my life without stress  
Dominating continents with my American Express (Wuh!)  
Flow Miami, she loves sushi  
A couple of drinks and she lets loose (Haha!)  
Louis Vuitton, lots of Armani, lots of Gucci (Ah!)  
Alcohol and piña colada, my glasses say Prada (Prrra!)  
Flow New York, she loves water  
Oh-oh okay, every minute, every hour  
Chillin' in my zone,  
Back in the block they say, Arcángel's cold

**[Interlude]**  
Elegance, for me elegance is a beautiful way  
To perfectly express thoughts (Good)  
With distinguished quality and above all, a lot of style (You copy?)

**[Verse 2]**  
Tell your witch or your santero to stir the pot better (Yeah!)  
No one can stop this little Trojan horse (No!)  
These days, everyone who throws shade at me, goes (Where?)  
Straight into the arms of Satan (Haha!)  
I'm more than a legend, like the Prince of Persia (Yes!)  
The Phenomenon, master of controversy (Yes!)  
Many say the kid is declining (No!)  
No, it was just that I was rising too fast (Haha!)  
Yes, it was that I was singing and traveling too quickly (Haha!)  
Since I was killing it too fast (Aha!)  
I, like I showed them the goat  
Quickly I proved, I wasn't playing (No!)  
That I'm ready for mine (How?)  
If there's money?, I accept any challenge (How?)  
If there's money?, I'm daring enough to get into trouble (What?)  
For my money, you could end up broken (That's right) (Prrra!)  
A tragedy could happen to you  
If there's money?, your life turns into a comedy (And what else?)  
Throw me back and you'll see, from the new school I'm the foreman  
First place (Haha!), first place and you last  
Last, I continue my life high class, Miami sold pass (Pa!)  
The women ride in the van, a couple of hitmen in the back (Hey!)  
Chill rookie, you know how I do it  
I shut them down, even when I take a dump  
Down the toilet and the cut is crazy  
Floating singers, through the path of the turd  
I hold my pressure, I don't get nervous  
They act like Carlitos, but here I'm the one who rolls  
We came afloat, we're no longer in the hole  
You all are too much movie, for too little roll (Prrra!)

**[Outro]**  
Evil is simply the tendency to cause harm  
An action done to the detriment of another  
It also becomes the main characteristic of a person  
Who always has bad intentions or purposes  
Bunch of fools (Haha!)
