**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Oscar Maydon & El Padrinito Toys]  
Record the board, babe, right away, no worries  
Your guy counts, let it be here  
And even though I have a ton of girls  
I don’t care, money is what matters  
A shady club, the place is underground  
Order whatever you want, we’re going to get wild  
An electro beat, music from hell  
Let it play at my funeral, that’s what I want  

[Chorus: Oscar Maydon & El Padrinito Toys]  
Whoever watches over me doesn’t sleep  
Neither Eleguá nor the homies  
The rich kids serve as a distraction  
I like the fashion  
I pull out the cash and they get scared  
The women who use me  
But I enjoy them all the more  
But I enjoy them all the more  

[Interlude: El Padrinito Toys & Oscar Maydon]  
And your buddy, El Padrinito Toys  
We’re on point, old man  
And pure Rancho Humilde, man  
And your buddy, Oscar Maydon  

[Verse 2: El Padrinito Toys & Oscar Maydon]  
I put on the necklaces  
Oh, what holy protection  
The godfather Leo already consulted me  
He said: Son, take on the world  
Because life goes by in a second  
I take a hit on the Can-Am  
San Felo, beaches, then we’ll go dune riding  
Exuberant style, let the speakers blast  
Right away, the girls go wild  

[Chorus: El Padrinito Toys & Oscar Maydon]  
Whoever watches over me doesn’t sleep  
Neither Eleguá nor the homies  
The rich kids serve as a distraction  
I like the fashion  
I pull out the cash and they get scared  
The women who use me  
But I enjoy them all the more  
But I enjoy them all the more
