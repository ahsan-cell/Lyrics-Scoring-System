**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's been a while since I felt this way  
All alone dancing, play me another song  
I can't take my eyes off you since the moment I saw you  
I'm imagining the taste of your lips  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A mistake that can be forgotten, ah-ah  

[Chorus]  
Let the night not end, let it last a little longer (Ooh-oh)  
I want a shot of your kisses to help me remember (Ooh, oh-oh)  
The bad decisions and the ones we’re about to make  
What happens between us, no one will ever talk about (Uh-uh, uh-uh)  

[Post-Chorus]  
The night, oh-oh  
And you're going to kill it, I love the drama (Oh-oh)  

[Verse 2]  
I know you have a bad reputation, but I also enjoy the drama  
Don't pretend, we've been through this before  
You know me, I know you, we saw everything with X-ray vision  
You know what happens when we're alone  

[Bridge]  
Today I dressed up to see you, and you’re the lucky one  
I don’t want tequila, I want that one, I don’t even know what he has  
Today I dressed up to see you, and you’re the lucky one  
I don’t want tequila, I want that one  

[Chorus]  
Let the night not end, let it last a little longer (Ooh-oh)  
I want a shot of your kisses to help me remember (Ooh, oh-oh)  
The bad decisions and the ones we’re about to make (Ooh-oh)  
What happens between us, no one will ever talk about (Uh-uh, uh-uh)  

[Outro]  
(The night) Ooh-oh  
(And you're going to kill it, I love the drama) Ooh, oh-oh  
Decisions, ooh (Uh-uh-uh)  
The bad decisions, oh-oh (Uuh, uh-uh)
