[Intro: Babo]  
Yo

[Verse 1: Babo]  
I bring the girls smoking weed  
And shaking their booties with this flow  
I'm feeling hot and saw in your story  
You're at the same party as me, you know  
You’re not alone, neither am I  
You’re a wild one, I’m a bad boy  
You’re the girl who reacts to me  
And dances to my songs on TikTok  
Come on, how good, let’s go for it  
I was spitting rhymes when I felt like it  
Dance for me, move it, drop it, record it, pose with that booty up  
Well worked, not fake  
I've seen it, touched it, and tasted it  
I've had her sleeping by my side  
That’s why I’m sure she’s heard me out  
Like a dog, I’ve sniffed her out  
Like in the pornos, I’ve done her right  
I’m the past she hasn’t moved on from  
The damn villain who’s messed with her the most  

[Pre-Chorus: Babo]  
And she’s all bitchy, bitchy  
Showing off her curves and her chest  
Dancing all bitchy, bitchy  
Taking molly with Fiji water  
And she’s all bitchy, bitchy  
Showing off her curves and her chest  
Dancing all bitchy, bitchy  
Taking molly with Fiji water  

[Chorus: Babo]  
All the girls, girls  
Are partying from party to party  
Shaking their booties, booties  
Smoking weed, weed  
All the girls, girls  
Are partying from party to party  
Shaking their booties, booties  
Smoking weed, weed  

[Verse 2: La Kelly]  
Hey Daddy, turn up my mini skirt  
I get really hot if you see me moving my booty, booty  
Hey Daddy, I know what you want  
Many girls shake it for you, but you want this girl, girl  
It’s clear you intend to get down with me  
And if it’s not at the big party, then no  
No worries, I saw your girl  
And you know I can get lit with the ladies too  
I unleash my wild side when the molly hits  
I get hornier if you film me for OnlyFans  
No one can resist when Kelly moves it  
My natural booty is trending again  
And those who can handle it, say hi to Karely  

[Pre-Chorus: Babo]  
And she’s all bitchy, bitchy  
Showing off her curves and her chest  
Dancing all bitchy, bitchy  
Taking molly with Fiji water  
And she’s all bitchy, bitchy  
Showing off her curves and her chest  
Dancing all bitchy, bitchy  
Taking molly with Fiji water  

[Chorus: Babo]  
All the girls, girls  
Are partying from party to party  
Shaking their booties, booties  
Smoking weed, weed  
All the girls, girls  
Are partying from party to party  
Shaking their booties, booties  
Smoking weed, weed  

[Verse 3: Babo]  
Her suitor doesn’t even amuse her  
It’s clear he’s not a bad boy  
She’s fiery and lives smiling  
While they throw her a good time  
Does she look happy? I don’t think so  
Is she content? I see she’s not  
That flirt needs a goal  
Fully complete in her heart  
I think the guy hasn’t even been with her  
Or he’s just boring because I see her  
And she hasn’t smiled for any reason  
Since we met when she arrived  
For nymphomaniacs, I’m a stallion  
For the ruffians, an old trickster  
Ah, for the ladies, a charmer  
But for you, I’m just a bald guy  
With your sweetie stuck in my mind  
What good luck to run into you again  
Honestly, I came to tell you  
I just want to see you smile  

[Pre-Chorus: Babo]  
And she’s all bitchy, bitchy  
Showing off her curves and her chest  
Dancing all bitchy, bitchy  
Taking molly with Fiji water  
And she’s all bitchy, bitchy  
Showing off her curves and her chest  
Dancing all bitchy, bitchy  
Taking molly with Fiji water  

[Chorus: Babo]  
All the girls, girls  
Are partying from party to party  
Shaking their booties, booties  
Smoking weed, weed  
All the girls, girls  
Are partying from party to party  
Shaking their booties, booties  
Smoking weed, weed
