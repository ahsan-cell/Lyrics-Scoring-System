**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Junior H & Peso Pluma]  
What a detail to message with death  
A Colt .45 that carries a picture  
Of the lord of the mountain, of drones and more  
Devil's horns alongside my security  
Old wolf in a rush to traffic dust  
God always watches over me and my little cap from Elegua*  

[Pre-Chorus: Junior H & Peso Pluma]  
In my blood, I carry the 701  
Lion's mane, 'cause I come from one  
Always connected, we’re not cowards  
Low profile, the kid is missed  
Though he’s gone, he’s never forgotten  
We’re warriors, we die as warriors  

[Chorus: Junior H]  
And with the corrido of the Blue Angel  
I ask God for forgiveness for my sins  
But that’s just how it is  

[Interlude: Junior H & Peso Pluma]  
Pure Doble P, old school  
Pure Junior H, old school  

[Verse 2: Peso Pluma & Junior H]  
Blue Rolls-Royce  
Like those buttons  
That for the final touch often jump in  
I fell in love with money, I want, want, want more  
Devil's horns and a squad for my security  
Old wolf in a rush to traffic dust  
God always watches over me and my little cap from Elegua  

[Pre-Chorus: Peso Pluma & Junior H]  
In my blood, I carry the 701  
Mane of a lion, 'cause I come from one  
Always connected, we’re not cowards  
Low profile, the kid is missed  
An RZR, the one that’s never forgotten  
We’re warriors, we die as warriors  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma]  
And with the corrido of the Blue Angel  
I ask my God for forgiveness for my sins  
But that’s just how it is  

[Outro: Peso Pluma]  
Ayayai!
