**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Natanael Cano & Gabito Ballesteros]  
I've been through it all, of course, I fought hard  
Only a couple know, I'm not the same as I was yesterday  
Mercedes AMG, G-Class 63  
What I once dreamed of, I've already bought it all  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]  
I'm great with the numbers, I jot everything down in my notebook  
I've got a blacklist ready, for anyone who crosses the line  
All the pretty girls, riding in my truck  
The radios keep playing, but I'm always on alert  

[Interlude: Natanael Cano & Peso Pluma]  
Goodbye!  
Yeah  
And well connected, buddy Gabito  
And raise the flag, old man  
With the Double P, yayay!  
Just like that, buddy Nata, just like that  
Buddy Gabito, goodbye!  
Pure Double P, old man, yay  

[Verse 2: Gabito Ballesteros, Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]  
A Jeeter to roll, I prefer the babies more  
Port of Mazatl√°n, overlooking the city  
In a private jet, I can land anywhere  
Popping champagne, there's cash to spend  
Moving the ice well, they'll see me everywhere  
In some Nike sneakers, I'm a hustler, and that's just how it is  

[Chorus: Gabito Ballesteros & Peso Pluma]  
I'm great with the numbers, I jot everything down in my notebook  
I've got a blacklist ready, for anyone who crosses the line  
All the pretty girls, riding in my truck  
The radios keep playing, but I'm always on alert
