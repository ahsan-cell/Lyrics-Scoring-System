**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Óscar Maydon & Junior H]  
Oh my!  
Compa Junior  
With this track, I feel like taking a shot  
Just don’t get down, compa Oscar, oh my  
Here it goes, girl  

[Verse 1: Junior H & Oscar Maydon]  
I bought you the prettiest flowers at the club  
I’ve got a '40 (a .40 caliber gun) in case a guy tries to mess with you  
The money I have, girl, is meant to be spent  
Not like those guys who keep begging around you  

[Chorus: Junior H & Oscar Maydon]  
Get in the truck, let’s go to the beach  
I don’t care if it’s night or early morning  
Don’t give me excuses, don’t leave me hanging  
We’re two people who connect on the same wavelength  
In one, I’ll call you, in two, I’ll be arriving  
In three, we’ll kiss, and in four, I’ll top up your balance  
So you can call me, I want your call  
To be together all weekend long  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  

[Interlude: Oscar Maydon & Junior H]  
Oh my!  
I love you, mamasita  
Just for a weekend, little one  
Haha  
This is how Junior H sounds, old friend  
Compa Luis  

[Verse 2: Oscar Maydon & Junior H]  
I live for moments, and I’m not playing around  
With my intentions, I swear I love you  
Pour me a drink while I light up a cigarette  
As it burns down, we’ll be loving each other  

[Chorus: Oscar Maydon & Junior H]  
Get in the truck, let’s go to the beach  
I don’t care if it’s night or early morning  
Don’t give me excuses, don’t leave me hanging  
We’re two people who connect on the same wavelength  
In one, I’ll call you, in two, I’ll be arriving  
In three, we’ll kiss, and in four, I’ll top up your balance  
So you can call me, I want your call  
To be together all weekend long  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  
I’m not going to beg  

[Outro: Oscar Maydon]  
Let that accordion play, compa Luis
