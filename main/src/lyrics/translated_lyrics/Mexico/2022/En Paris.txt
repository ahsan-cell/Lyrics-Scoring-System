**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
A girl dancing  
I’m throwing bills around  
In the Can-Am buzzing  
And we’re feeling good

**[Interlude]**  
(Ira jodidon!)  
(Compa Chachito)  
(Compa Panther)  
(Compa Chris)

**[Chorus]**  
A girl dancing  
I’m throwing bills around  
In the Can-Am buzzing  
And we’re feeling good

**[Verse 1]**  
In the business I’m in  
I’m happy for a while  
That’s why I’m buzzing  
And enjoying models  
A damn panther  
Surrounded by sheep  
Don’t come here with limits  
Long live the wildness  
I want everything in excess  
Women, cars, dogs  
Yachts and more models  
Sick thoughts

**[Interlude]**  
(Compa Chachito)  
(Just like that with my buddy Junior!)  
(What’s up)

**[Verse 2]**  
A Versace robe  
And a Bulgari bag  
If you call me daddy  
I’ll make love to you in Paris  
Shirts of talacas  
Skulls are my weapons  
Smells like rum with champagne  
Dom Pérignon I love  
If you like the simple  
Baby, you’re not for me  
I want you to want it all  
Get stuck in the mud  
For love, I’m no good  
Better serve up some coke  
I toast with my friends  
And let the corrido play on

**[Outro]**  
(Let the party never end, old man)  
(So everyone can get into the common vibe, folks)
