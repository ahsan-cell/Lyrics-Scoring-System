**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Adelaido “Payo” Solís]  
I write you messages  
Every night  
But I delete them  
To leave you on read  
That bad moment  
I’d rather save myself from it  

[Pre-Chorus: Carín León]  
My pride is so great  
And it weighs me down  
I won’t humiliate myself  
But still, I want you to know  

[Chorus: Adelaido “Payo” Solís & Carín León]  
You should be here, here where I love you  
But instead, you’re over there where I miss you  
I wish I could ask you, to come back, to come back  
You should be here, here where I love you  
But instead, you’re over there where I miss you  
I wish I could ask you to come back, to come back  
So that my body can have its soul returned  

[Bridge: Julián Leña Jr.]  
And this is  
Grupo Frontera  
And my friend Carín León  

[Pre-Chorus: Adelaido “Payo” Solís]  
My pride is so great  
And it weighs me down  
I won’t humiliate myself  
But still, I want you to know  

[Chorus: Carín León & Adelaido “Payo” Solís]  
You should be here, here where I love you  
But instead, you’re over there where I miss you  
I wish I could ask you to come back, to come back  
You should be here, here where I love you  
But instead, you’re over there where I miss you  
I wish I could ask you to come back, to come back  
So that my body can have its soul returned  
I wish I could ask you to come back, to come back  
So that my body can have its soul returned
