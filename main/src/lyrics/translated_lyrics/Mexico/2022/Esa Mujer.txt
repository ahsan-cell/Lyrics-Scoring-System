**Translated Lyrics:**

If you see something very suspicious, she can stir up a mess  
Her character isn’t very calm, but she’s quite special, I guess  
She’s a cat with long claws that can leave you in distress  

That woman is setting the rules  
That woman wants to take control  
That woman is ready for marriage  
Grab her before she’s gone, before she’s gone  

That woman is something essential  
She’s a gem waiting to be found  
That woman is ready for marriage  
Grab her before she’s gone, before she’s gone  

She doesn’t pretend to know it all, but she can teach you well  
But she’s more beautiful than you think, she keeps you under her spell  
How easy it is to fall for her captivating charm  
She wraps you up and makes you hers, till you’re disarmed  

That woman is setting the rules  
That woman wants to take control  
That woman is ready for marriage  
Grab her before she’s gone, before she’s gone  

That woman is something essential  
She’s a gem waiting to be found  
That woman is ready for marriage  
Grab her before she’s gone, before she’s gone  

Her power is immeasurable, she’s too much of a woman  
Love can be an art in its nakedness  
My girl...  

That woman is setting the rules  
That woman wants to take control  
That woman is ready for marriage  
Grab her before she’s gone, before she’s gone  

That woman is something essential  
She’s a gem waiting to be found  
That woman is ready for marriage  
Grab her before she’s gone, before she’s gone  

Before she’s gone... gone...
