**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]  
I wake up, take a shower, then I get to work  
It's poison, high quality, it lifts you up  
The phones never stop ringing  
If it's not some girl, it's because a client wants more  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]  
And the packages are well wrapped  
No worries, I can't fail  
I'm always ready to cross  
Powder, wheels, and also glass  
Here the little paper comes and goes  
The girls go wild  
We enjoy it, whether good or bad  
I won't complain about this life  

[Interlude: Natanael Cano]  
Yeah!  
And well loaded  
With the Double P  
The corridos tumbados*  
Just like that, old man  

[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & Peso Pluma]  
Dressed fine in Balenciaga, the corridos sounded great  
The girls danced really well, and I'm rocking Silver LV  
I feel like I'm flying now, bro  
And here we’re never going to complain  
Why look back?  
No problem, I’m going to keep pushing  

[Chorus: Natanael Cano & Peso Pluma]  
Well wrapped, the packages go  
No worries, I can't fail  
I'm always ready to cross  
Powder, wheels, and also glass  
And well wrapped, the packages go  
No worries, I can't fail  
I'm always ready to cross  
Powder, wheels, and also glass  

[Outro Instrumental]
