**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: ROSALÍA]**  
I need another kiss  
One of those you give me  
Being far from you is hell  
Being close to you is my peace  
And I love it every time you arrive  
And I hate it when you leave  
I’ll go with you to the end  
Don’t leave me alone, where are you going, where are you going?  

**[Post-Chorus: ROSALÍA & Rauw Alejandro]**  
Na-na-na, na-na-na  
Come here  
Na-na-na, na-na-na  
Where are you going? (Yeah)  

**[Verse 1: Rauw Alejandro]**  
Oh-oh, oh-oh  
If you dance for me, you give it all  
Oh-oh, oh-oh  
Now we’re alone and you take it all off  
My feelings don’t fit in this pen  
Hey, how do I tell you?  
You’re the infinite exponent, the equation, the sum  
The moon seems small for you (Yah!)  
And even if I’m far, you’re the closest person to me  
If my phone is about to die, I’ll only let you know  
If there was another life before, I drank from your waters  
I should have met you  

**[Pre-Chorus: ROSALÍA]**  
The best thing I have  
Is the love you give me  
It smells like tobacco and melon  
And like a Sunday in the city  
If you wait for me  
I can bend time  
I can tie up the sky  
And give it all to you  

**[Chorus: Rauw Alejandro, Rauw Alejandro & ROSALÍA]**  
I want you to give me another kiss  
One of those you give me  
Being far from you is hell  
Being close to you is my peace  
And I love it every time you arrive  
And I hate it when you leave  
I’ll go with you to the end  
Don’t leave me alone, where are you going, where are you going?  

**[Verse 2: ROSALÍA]**  
You smoke like they’re going to kick you out for smoking  
And you dance like I know a god would move while dancing  
And you kiss like you’ve always known how to kiss  
And no one had to teach you  

**[Pre-Chorus: ROSALÍA & Rauw Alejandro, Both]**  
The best thing I have  
Is the love you give me  
It smells like tobacco and melon  
And like a Sunday in the city  
And if you wait for me, eh  
I can bend time  
I can tie up the sky  
And give it all to you  

**[Chorus: ROSALÍA & Rauw Alejandro, Both]**  
I need another kiss  
One of those you give me  
Being far from you is hell  
Being close to you is my peace  
And I love it every time you arrive  
And I hate it when you leave  
I’ll go with you to the end  
Don’t leave me alone (Alone), where are you going, where are you going?  

**[Post-Chorus: ROSALÍA]**  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na
