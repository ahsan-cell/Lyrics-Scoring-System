**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
And all along the boulevard  
With my buddy Flaco rolling up his sleeves  
In some sandals, my cap tilted to the side  
For the Zapata, the Gordo's in charge  
Throwing lines with Manny and el Caña  
Ready for chaos, always connected  
And my RT in Acapulco  
And if there's trouble, I bury it  
We’re not here just to make noise  
I’m ready to throw down  
And a Glock that’s always with me  
Always ready for a scare  

[Interlude]  
And let the bundles keep coming  
Your buddy Chinito  
Straight from Apaseo el Alto  

[Verse 2]  
And my buddy Mario who’s never left me  
Sometimes we’re just hanging out  
And my buddy Power and also Mau  
They’ve got my back, never let me down  
And my buddy Sapo, if there’s trouble, he jumps in  
Always ready to throw punches  
And here, envy doesn’t exist, honestly  
And why tell them if it’s not worth it?  
I’m the Gordo, so you know who I am  
And on a bike, I’ll show up in fifteen  

[Outro]  
And this one’s heading straight to Acapulco  
Pure street mafia
