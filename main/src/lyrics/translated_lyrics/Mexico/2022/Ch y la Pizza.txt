**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Fuerza Regida & Natanael Cano]  
Iron, man  
Mark the section  
Oh!  
Well pulled, buddy Jesús  
For the CH and the pizza, buddy Nata  
Just so they can go and say, old man  
Of course, old man  
And pure street mafia  

[Verse 1: Natanael Cano & Fuerza Regida]  
It’s not a matter of cult, but I wear the chains  
Santería that almost no one has, there it goes  
In the States, we split the cheese for the CH and the pizza  
Pure tough guys with guts, it’s not just for show  

[Chorus: Natanael Cano & Fuerza Regida]  
I bring Ranch Roll sushi for the ladies  
And a fancy club, and those who can, can  
JGL, making green  
Long hair like I wear it  
Get ready because I carry the big horn  
Betrayals can’t stand, for the good ones are the saints  

[Interlude: Natanael Cano & Fuerza Regida]  
Oh my!  
Well pulled, old man  
And long live the CH, long live Sonora  
Another level!  
Long live the street mafia (Aha!)  

[Verse 2: Fuerza Regida & Natanael Cano]  
I’m a standout for the party and the chaos  
But if it’s time to work, boots on and let’s roll  
I carry pure tough folks blessed by their mothers  
All sponsored by someone who comes and goes  

[Chorus: Fuerza Regida & Natanael Cano]  
In tough times, you see people from the 19  
A fancy club, those who can, can  
JGL, making green  
The cap well placed, I carry it like a boss  
Get ready because I carry a big horn  
Betrayals can’t stand, for the good ones are the saints  

[Outro: Fuerza Regida & Natanael Cano]  
Of course, old man (Yeah!)
