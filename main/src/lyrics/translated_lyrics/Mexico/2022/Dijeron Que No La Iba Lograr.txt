**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Chino Pacas]  
And for those who said we wouldn't make it, haha

[Verse 1: Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
They said I wouldn’t succeed, and now everyone’s quiet  
So they can see what the kid has got  
And the little plant on this side is thriving  
I’m not backing down, not even thinking about it  
Because I’m doing great, and none of us are folding  
Everyone in the neighborhood is doing well  
Real tough, throwing down in LA  
And we’re rolling strong in APA, all over TJ in an RZR

[Interlude: Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
And cheers to Apaseo el Alto, Guanajuato  
Pure 413  
And that’s right, my buddy Chinito Pacas  
Pure Fuerza Regida, old man

[Verse 2: Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
The brand has a seal, it’s LDLC, with my brother Turo I never backed down  
That’s why now I’m at a hundred, we made it happen, no way to pull back  
And we’re going hard to place our bets  
I know Arturo will never fold  
And ready for trouble, ready to party  
With his gear on for anyone who passes by

[Outro: Fuerza Regida & Chino Pacas]  
Hell yeah, old man  
Grab your hair, brother  
Long live the mafia  
We’re from the streets  
Right now everyone’s quiet
