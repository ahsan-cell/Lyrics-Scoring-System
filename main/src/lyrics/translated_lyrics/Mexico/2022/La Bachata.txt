**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I blocked you on Insta, but from another account, I see your stories (Oh-oh-oh)  
I deleted your number; not sure why since I know it by heart  
You hurt me, and yet I miss you  
And even though I know one day I'll forget you  
I still haven't, it's complicated  
Everything we did, I like to remember  

[Chorus]  
I'm driving through the streets where you kissed me  
Listening to the songs you once dedicated to me  
I'd tell you to come back, but that's not something you ask for  
Better to ask God to watch over me  
Because I'm driving through the streets where you kissed me  
Listening to the songs you once dedicated to me  
I'd tell you to come back, but that's not something you ask for  
Better to ask God to watch over me, eh  

[Verse 2]  
To protect me from another who resembles you  
I don't want to fall like I did for you  
I hope you fall in love, that someone does to you what you did to me  
You taught me not to love just anyone  
And also how I donâ€™t want to be loved  
No-oh-oh, we were three in a two-person relationship  
I won't forgive you, ask God for forgiveness  
I said I forgot you, but the truth is that I-oh-oh  
I-oh-oh  

[Chorus]  
I'm driving through the streets where you kissed me  
Listening to the songs you once dedicated to me  
I'd tell you to come back, but that's not something you ask for  
Better to ask God to watch over me  
Because I'm driving through the streets where you kissed me  
Listening to the songs you once dedicated to me  
I'd tell you to come back, but that's not something you ask for  
Better to ask God to watch over me, eh  

[Outro]
