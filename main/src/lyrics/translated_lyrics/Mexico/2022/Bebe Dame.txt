**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Jesús Paz & Payo Solís]  
Iron  
Cheer up  
From the original cumbias, with my buddies Grupo Frontera  
And Fuerza Regida, my friend  
Iron, then  
Let’s go, compa Carlos  
Cheer up, cheer up (Say it!)

[Verse: Payo Solís]  
I've been thinking about us for a while  
If we can fix this situation  
What we have is a war in love  
I defend what my heart asks for

[Pre-Chorus: Jesús Paz]  
I want to have you every day  
You used to charm me with what you said  
Having you back is my fantasy

[Chorus: Jesús Paz & Payo Solís]  
Baby, what I ask of you, come, give me  
What I demand, I wish it wouldn’t be  
Another day passes without seeing you at dawn  
Baby, what I ask of you, come, give me  
What I demand, I wish it wouldn’t be  
Another day passes without seeing you at dawn  

[Post-Chorus: Payo Solís & Jesús Paz]  
I have a thousand plans  
Proposals for love  
You and I in solitude  
I wrote you a poem  
To win your heart  
I just want to love you

[Refrain: Payo Solís & Jesús Paz]  
I’m here waiting for you, just come, come, come  
I do it differently  
I’m here waiting for you, just come, come, come  
You don’t leave my mind  
I’m here waiting for you, just come, come, come  
I know how to love you  
Tell me yes  
Tell me yes, I’m going to have you

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus: Payo Solís]  
I want to have you every day  
You used to charm me with what you said  
Having you back is my fantasy

[Chorus: Payo Solís & Jesús Paz]  
Baby, what I ask of you, come, give me  
What I demand, I wish it wouldn’t be  
Another day passes without seeing you at dawn  
Baby, what I ask of you, come, give me  
What I demand, I wish it wouldn’t be  
Another day passes without seeing you at dawn  

[Post-Chorus: Jesús Paz & Payo Solís]  
I have a thousand plans  
Proposals for love  
You and I in solitude  
I wrote you a poem  
To win your heart  
I just want to love you

[Refrain: Jesús Paz & Payo Solís]  
I’m here waiting for you, just come, come, come  
I do it differently  
I’m here waiting for you, just come, come, come  
You don’t leave my mind  
I’m here waiting for you, just come, come, come  
I know how to love you  
Tell me yes  
Tell me yes, I’m going to have you
