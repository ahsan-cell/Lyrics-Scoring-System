**[Pre-Chorus: Peso Pluma & Yng Lvcas]**  
Let go, crazy girl, then soak it all in  
Get wet from my body, you know, hop in the Benz  
What’s up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz  
Stars on the ceiling, we’ve already taken off  
But you know tonight you’re all mine  
Come on, climb on top of me, send your location, I’ll pick you up  

**[Chorus: Yng Lvcas]**  
She wants me to play some music  
So she can dance down low, my baby  
We drank a couple of bottles  
And still, she remembers what we did yesterday  
She wants me to play some music  
So she can dance down low, my baby  
We drank a couple of bottles  
And still, she remembers what we did yesterday  

**[Verse 1: Yng Lvcas]**  
She hasn’t forgotten how we had fun  
We went to the club and danced close together  
Like dogs in heat, kisses and a few drinks  
She stayed by my side and said, “I think I’m in love”  
She smokes, she drinks  
She’s a little devil, small but spicy  
I love it when her pants brush against me  
She loves it too, you can see it on her face, she enjoys it  

**[Bridge: Peso Pluma]**  
She has a boyfriend but doesn’t behave  
She tells me, “Chill, the relationship is broken”  
Our bodies collide and crash  
Our lips meet, her leggings are tight  

**[Chorus: Yng Lvcas]**  
She wants me to play some music  
So she can dance down low, my baby  
We drank a couple of bottles  
And still, she remembers what we did yesterday  
She wants me to play some music  
So she can dance down low, my baby  
We drank a couple of bottles  
And still, she remembers what we did yesterday  

**[Verse 2: Yng Lvcas & Peso Pluma]**  
Yesterday, you were moving so well, so well  
The scent of Chanel lingered  
We’re at a thousand degrees Fahrenheit  
She’s hot and pretty  
You play her music and she gets excited on her own  
At the party, she never holds back  
A couple of friends, completing the crew  
But you, mama, you know, you drive me wild  
Crazy girl, come here, get close from behind  
It’s just you and me on a fleeting trip  
Interstellar, devouring you whole  
We’ll smoke some weed together  
In the room, on the rooftop, and in my bed  
Baby, I think they’re calling you, answer tomorrow  
Don’t let the flame die out  
In the AMG listening to "Wheels and Crystal"  
Burning the poison that has me flying, babe  
A kiss for Barbie, so she dances close  
Little slanted eyes like a puki from Taiwan, -án  
Like a puki from Taiwan  
Like a puki from Taiwan  
I’ll have that whenever I want, mommy, babe  

**[Pre-Chorus: Peso Pluma & Yng Lvcas]**  
Let go, crazy girl, then soak it all in (Dance down low, my baby)  
Get wet from my body, you know, hop in the Benz (Dance down low, my baby)  
What’s up? My baby in the Mercedes-Benz (Dance down low, my baby)  
Stars on the ceiling, we’ve already taken off (Eh)  

**[Chorus: Yng Lvcas]**  
Oh, she wants me to play some music  
So she can dance down low, my baby  
We drank a couple of bottles  
And still, she remembers what we did yesterday  
She wants me to play some music  
So she can dance down low, my baby  
We drank a couple of bottles  
And still, she remembers what we did yesterday  

**[Outro: Peso Pluma & Yng Lvcas]**  
Tonight is a night to be single  
She loves to dance and be close to you  
The young religion  
The double P  
Lil Yng  
It’s the remix
