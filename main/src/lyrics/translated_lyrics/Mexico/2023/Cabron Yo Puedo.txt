**Translated Lyrics:**

The consonant rhyme is easy, you just have to know how to find them  
But if we add the difficulty of not using plurals, participles, infinitives, or gerunds  
That's where the real complication comes in, and adding just one single ending, in this case, ENTO  
Gransan from Bilbao, new world record, 2200 words  

I introduce myself, I'm not the rapper of the moment  
But I leave the famous ones lying on the pavement  
I don’t have any of their Grammys, I’m not trying  
But when I rap, it’s a style I patented  
All with the same consonant rhyme, I’m sorry  
What’s hard for you is a damn fairy tale  
I grab the mic, I heat it up, I catch the beat and smash it  
I've been at it so long that I’m the town hall  
Three years later, watching their demise  
They know about rapping, not hip hop, I don’t invent  
They know how to rhyme, not every element  
They lack vocabulary because they’re a farce  
I can have an ego, I’m not lying  
I was part of the club, I’m a violent poet  
They want to flow but suffer from constipation  
I eat them up like an Advent calendar  
Never in jail, at home eating a mint  
While I write during confinement  
For me, their double tempo is way too slow  
Because I’m an MC, a rapper one hundred percent  
A bastard, yes, who writes brutally  
I have to admit I’m almost never content  
I leave anyone I face lying on the floor  
They do 3x4 and run out of breath  
I represent the real life of a worker  
Waking up early every day to make a living  
Making music while working is suffering  
You think a video a month is talent  
Writing lyrics locked up in a convent  
Military discipline of captain, sergeant  
They want to mess with me and with just one argument  
I blow apart their whole camp with a puff  
I’m the authority, I don’t accept demands  
It’s going to be hand-to-hand combat, bloody  
I’ve gone so long without eating, I’m so hungry  
I’ll run you over, even if you’re hefty  
I’ve always been the joker since my birth  
Sometimes I make mistakes and feel remorse  
But I no longer torture myself, I no longer torment  
Those who know me, know my behavior  
I’m one of those who sits down to write and doesn’t comment  
My commitment to rhyme is a vow  
I know I messed you up, I felt resentment  
Don’t get up when you’ve been thrown to the pavement  
This verse has almost no foundation  
For me, it’s just entertainment  
And still, I’m screwing the whole regulation  
While they spit out excrement from their mouths  
I’ve been around so long that I’m the Renaissance  
For this scratch, you have no polish left  
I skip your prayer and your commandment  
Let God come and see my resurgence  
The pen, the notebook, places I frequent  
I’ll show you the technique, I have the document  
Your style over any beat is sleepy  
You have no option for a reply, I’m sorry  
I’m still the same during isolation  
I do it a cappella and with accompaniment  
This for a newbie is like a treasure trove  
Like new weapons for a terrorist  
I don’t know for sure, but I sense it  
No matter the country, no matter the accent  
Because when I rap, the kicking starts  
They’re left dead, signs of strangulation  
It doesn’t go well for them, I hear their lament  
I’m like Eminem, dead from boredom  
And I don’t intend to have his recognition  
I know myself well, also my temperament  
My lyrics are fiber, their pencil, greasy  
There are things I say that are daring  
But I’ve always been like this, if not, I’d be exempt  
For weak MCs, I’m the superfood  
When I drop a hit, I provoke discontent  
Among all those slackers who don’t train  
They study me, observe me, follow me  
Because they know deep down I teach them a lesson  
They think they’re professionals, just rudiments  
I’m the copper in a coil, they’re filament  
Infected like a virus, my free is virulent  
Your organ suffering a tearing  
I adhere to the beat like fucking glue  
A love strike from Cupid, infatuation  
With a technique controlled by this prodigy  
I chase words, I make a corral  
Today I’m the tyrant and it’s your submission  
Your admiration for this flow I increase  
From today on, you suffer from infatuation  
I provoke hurricanes and on the ground, lands
