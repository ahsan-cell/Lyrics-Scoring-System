**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]  
Buddy, what do you think of that girl?  
The one dancing alone, I like her for myself  
Beautiful! She knows she's stunning  
Everyone's watching her as she dances  
I approach and lay on the charm  
We drink without hesitation, just temptation  
I said, "I'm going to win over your family, soon you'll be mine"  
She told me I'm crazy, but she likes it  
That no guy like me acts this way  

[Interlude: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]  
And here you go, girl  
And pure Doble P, old man  
Just like that, buddy Pedro  
All Eslabon Armado  
For the girls  
Cha-chau!  

[Verse 2: Peso Pluma & Pedro Tovar]  
I'm not a guy with money  
But when it comes to the heart, I deliver everything  
She grabbed me, holding my hand tight  
My buddy couldn't believe it, that it was me passing by  
Her body, I swear to God, was so perfect  
Her waist like a model  
From the start, her eyes captivated me  
She likes me, and I like her too
