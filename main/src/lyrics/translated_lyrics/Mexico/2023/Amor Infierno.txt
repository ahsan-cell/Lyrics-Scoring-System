**Coka$ian**

[Hook]  
Even a devil may cry, devil may cry, baby devil may cry, devil may cry  
Because I’m alone in my castle, shooting burning arrows into eternity  
Eternity!  
White eyes, marble, like a vampire  
No arrow from Cupid, never in love  
A thousand years sleepless, like a vampire  
My heart neglected, until I freeze

[Part 1]  
The memories are covered in dust  
No virgin has ever woken me from this nightmare  
A thousand years hidden away, just locked inside  
Everything I once knew - just a pile of dirt

I seek the inferno and walk through the flames  
My life is a tree, my soul is trapped  
Belial pulls my strings, too many useless tears have fallen on my path  
Out of anger and envy, too much blood has been shed  
My past - rotting earth  
Finding my peace was too tempting  
That’s why I’ve learned to die  
My blade rusty, like my heart  
Born in frost, I feel nothing anymore  
No one who knew me remains among the living  
They call (?), the demons beneath me  
All the stars have gone out  
Because the sea closed over us  
Finally dying seems tempting  
But I will never be one with God

The fight with my demons lasts longer than my silver blade  
In which my face reflects before I someday leap  
To taste love just once remains my last wish  
Yet I no longer hear your voice

[Hook]  
Even a devil may cry, devil may cry, baby devil may cry, devil may cry  
Because I’m alone in my castle, shooting burning arrows into eternity  
Eternity!  
White eyes, marble, like a vampire  
No arrow from Cupid, never in love  
A thousand years sleepless, like a vampire  
My heart neglected, until I freeze
