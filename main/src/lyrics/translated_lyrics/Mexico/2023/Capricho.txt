**Translated Lyrics:**

This is McDrive music - It’s all about ice cream and beef  
This is that "I want something to eat while driving by" song  
I want to stay seated like a bad student  
Rappers want to smoke, but I’m eating a bag  

[Part 1]  
When you see the giant M, scream and roll down your windows  
Forget the pedestrian zone  
Accelerate the car to 103, take the entrance  
Pump this track up, the voice says 'Hello,' then the order booms  
Fries small, medium, large, everything should be big today  
Cola small, medium, large, everything should be big today  
I want beef like really tough rappers  
Everything on the menu plus the specials  

[Hook]  

[Part 2]  
Throw your hands in the air - But don’t hurt yourselves  
Because maybe you don’t even have a convertible  
Throw your hands in the air - But don’t hurt yourselves  
Because maybe you don’t even have a bike  
You call it the yellow M, I call it the golden seagull  
You dine with knives and forks, only real snobs do that  
So here’s the rule: real food has to swim  
I raise my eyebrows like Ekko, and you know what I want  
My license plate leads the database  
I just drive through while you park on the shoulder  
Your car smells like air freshener, mine smells like McNuggets  
That’s how you easily turn a Golf into an S-Class  

[Bridge]  
Take my cheeseburger, another cheeseburger  
Stuff them in your cheeks but don’t spit  
Take even more cheeseburgers, a lot more cheeseburgers  
Stuff them in your cheeks and match the hook with  

[Hook] (x2)
