**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I don’t see you anymore, just get lost  
I went off with my friends, found another girl like you but better  
She gave it to me better and even screamed louder  
We went shopping, and I bought her everything I never bought you  
And I’m not looking for you anymore, I’ve kicked the habit  
I went with Briana, Juliana, and Tania, and with someone who’s nothing like you  

[Chorus]  
Party, party  
The girl says "Daddy, daddy"  
I don’t know you, babe, babe  
I forgot your name  
Party, party  
The girl says "Daddy, daddy"  
I don’t know you, babe, babe  
I forgot your name  

[Instrumental Interlude]  

[Verse 2]  
All for a horn, and now you’re out of luck  
You’re no longer in charge, and now because of your foolishness, it all slipped away, baby  
I’m still in my story with nothing but princesses  
I never rushed, the life of an artist, and for the sweethearts, prince  

[Chorus]  
Party, party  
The girl says "Daddy, daddy"  
I don’t know you, babe, babe  
I forgot your name  
Party, party  
The girl says "Daddy, daddy"  
I don’t know you, babe, babe  
I forgot your name  

[Outro]  
Cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, cha, hey  
Fuerza Regida  
Party, party  
The girl says "Daddy, daddy"  
I don’t know you, babe, babe  
I forgot your name
