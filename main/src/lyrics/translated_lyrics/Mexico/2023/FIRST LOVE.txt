**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse: Oscar Ortiz]  
Since that night you left me defeated  
I don’t know what you did, I haven’t healed  
It’s been months and I still haven’t forgotten you  
You hurt me, and you’ve accepted it  

[Pre-Chorus: Edgardo Nuñez]  
Here I go, foolishly remembering, never stopping  
Always the same, I hurt myself alone  
Now that you’re gone, how I’ve matured  
I know it’s too late, you’re not by my side  
How I wish I could have you by my side, woh-woh, woh-woh, woh  

[Chorus: Oscar Ortiz & Edgardo Nuñez]  
I wish I knew what you feel, let’s see  
Explain it to me just once  
What did I do to you for you to end this relationship?  
Only you, only you, only you  
I admit that I’ve cried  
I think of you, think of you, think of you  
Knowing that I wasn’t the bad one  
You left me, and I wasn’t the bad one  
On my birthday, how you’ve hurt me  
What were you thinking if I was never bad?  
You just left and left me defeated, woh-oh, woh-oh, woh-oh  

[Interlude: Oscar Ortiz & Edgardo Nuñez]  
Let’s take a shot, buddy Edgardo  
Yeah, for sure  
Let’s do it, buddy Oscar  

[Pre-Chorus: Oscar Ortiz]  
Here I go, foolishly remembering, never stopping  
Always the same, I hurt myself alone  
Now that you’re gone, how I’ve matured  
I know it’s too late, you’re not by my side  
How I wish I could have you by my side, woh-woh, woh-woh, woh  

[Chorus: Edgardo Nuñez & Oscar Ortiz]  
I wish I knew what you feel, let’s see  
Explain it to me just once  
What did I do to you for you to end this relationship?  
Only you, only you, only you  
I admit that I’ve cried  
I think of you, think of you, think of you  
Knowing that I wasn’t the bad one  
You left me, and I wasn’t the bad one  
On my birthday, how you’ve hurt me  
What were you thinking if I was never bad?  
You just left and left me defeated, woh-oh, woh-oh, woh-oh
