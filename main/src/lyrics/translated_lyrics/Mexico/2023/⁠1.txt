**[Verse]**  
Who would believe you  
Every time you say you don’t love me anymore?  
Do as you wish,  
But it’s clear that you’re dying of love.  
And I won’t buy it; we both know you haven’t forgotten me.  
And if it were true, then why the hell did you call me?  
Remember this well:  
Without you, I feel like a hundred.

**[Chorus]**  
From now on, I’m your unbeatable one,  
And to your friends, I’m the unnamable.  
The number one in your heart,  
And we both know I’m right.  
You drew the short straw because I won’t come back.  
From now on, I’m your irreplaceable,  
Look around and you’ll see you won’t find another.  
Because for you, I’m the only one that exists.  
Deny that I’ve been your greatest love.  
I know you won’t be able to,  
Deep down, I couldn’t either.

**[Instrumental Interlude]**  
**[Chorus]**  
From now on, I’m your unbeatable one,  
And to your friends, I’m the unnamable.  
The number one in your heart,  
And we both know I’m right.  
You drew the short straw because I won’t come back.  
From now on, I’m your irreplaceable,  
Look around and you’ll see you won’t find another.  
Because for you, I’m the only one that exists.  
Deny that I’ve been your greatest love.  
I know you won’t be able to,  
Deep down, yeah, I couldn’t either.
