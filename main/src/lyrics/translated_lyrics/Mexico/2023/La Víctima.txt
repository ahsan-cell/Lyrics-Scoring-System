**[Chorus]**  
I've thought it over  
Twice before you play me with "I don't know anymore"  
Don't play the victim, you clearly know what you did  
We made mistakes  
But this time I won't go back because you've crossed the line  

**[Verse 1]**  
And it was never enough for you to calm down with the insults and see  
The man who loved you, you didn't appreciate, and you left for money  
Now you want to find me  
But I can't anymore because I'm everywhere  
And AMG in my caravan with all the crew, I went to that private place  
I wanted to get drunk to stop thinking about you, and there you were  
In the arms of someone else  
And I thought you cared  
And again with your lies  

**[Interlude]**  
The victim  

**[Chorus]**  
I've thought it over  
Twice before you play me with "I don't know anymore"  
Don't play the victim, you clearly know what you did  
We made mistakes  
But this time I won't go back because you've crossed the line  

**[Verse 2]**  
And right away, grab your things, get lost  
I don't want to see you again  
Live that life you always wanted  
You're so ungrateful  
You broke my heart because I thought you cared  
And again with your lies
