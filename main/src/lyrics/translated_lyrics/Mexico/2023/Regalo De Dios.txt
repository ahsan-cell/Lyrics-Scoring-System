**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
When I’m in your arms, I forget everything  
I’m lucky to have you  
Here, waking up by my side  
I’m in debt because you came into my life  

[Chorus]  
As if you were made just for me  
And I didn’t ask for it, it just came to me  
And you’re worth double, yes, a gift from God  
Destined for me  

[Post-Chorus]  
I’ll be the one in charge of always taking care of you  
So that you lack nothing  
My only mission will be to make you very happy  
In good times and bad, I’ll be with you  
For whatever you need  
No matter what happens, I’ll be there  
The reward for me is seeing your lovely face smile  

[Interlude]  
Yayay!, little one  
And it’s Julión Álvarez and his Norteño Banda, listen  
Auh!  

[Chorus]  
As if you were made just for me  
And I didn’t ask for it, it just came to me  
And you’re worth double, yes, a gift from God  
Destined for me  

[Post-Chorus]  
I’ll be the one in charge of always taking care of you  
So that you lack nothing  
My only mission will be to make you very happy  
In good times and bad, I’ll be with you  
For whatever you need  
No matter what happens, I’ll be there  
The reward for me  
Is seeing your lovely face smile
