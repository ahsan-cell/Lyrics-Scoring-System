**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
And if she leaves, well, I wish her well  
'Cause I don't have time to waste  
She thinks she's the only woman  
But what does it matter? If she goes, then she goes  
What I throw away, I won't pick up again  
This will be the last time, girl, I wasn't born yesterday  

[Verse]  
If you think I'm here for your nonsense  
I'll tell you to your face, there's a line behind you  
This time it won't be just a tease  
Stay with your desires, just get out of here  
Everything has gone wrong  
You left realizing that sooner or later this was bound to happen  

[Chorus]  
So please, let me be  
If you see that I've already forgotten you  
I deleted the photos and the messages  
I don't want to know anything more about you  
What a heart of stone  
How sad that you never realized I always loved you  
Honestly, I wish you well  

[Interlude]  
(Heart of stone)  

[Chorus]  
And if she leaves, well, I wish her well  
'Cause I don't have time to waste  
She thinks she's the only woman  
But what does it matter? If she goes, then she goes  
What I throw away, I won't pick up again  
This will be the last time, girl, I wasn't born yesterday  

[Chorus]  
So please, let me be  
If you see that I've already forgotten you  
I deleted the photos and the messages  
I don't want to know anything more about you  
What a heart of stone  
How sad that you never realized I always loved you  
Honestly, I wish you well  

[Outro Instrumental]
