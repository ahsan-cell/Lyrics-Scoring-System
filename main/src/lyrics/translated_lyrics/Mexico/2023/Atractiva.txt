**[Hook]**  
Father, God, Lord, Creator, Allah  
Jehovah and Messiah, Omniscient and Christ  
Vs  
Devil, Satan, and Diabolo  
Lucifer, Antichrist, and Mephisto  

Players and opponents. The essential level of every narrative  
Every director and author writes down the rules  
You have faith? - No, you just have no good reason  
Welcome to the side of reason  

**[Verse 1]**  
You get caught up in it. You only see Christmas  
Only holidays, Pentecost, Easter, and All Saints' Day  
You get baptized, confirmed, and confirmed again  
You can’t even remember; it just kind of happened  
You were raised this way by your parents and others  
It’s just the societal standard  
Religion is global, and with so many believers, not everyone can be wrong, so what’s there to question? Sure. And by 16, you believe in God and Jesus anyway  
The girls dig how openly you talk about it  
You promise yourself support, even if just for emergencies  
And it looks cool, a little cross around your neck  
And you pray. Maybe once a year, maybe several times a day, and you talk as if someone is there  
Understand your mind, grasp logic, understand logical circles, find reasons, but be reasonable, child  

**[Verse 2]**  
You say your faith eludes my understanding, is unexplainable, and that God is as real as everything else for you  
You’ve felt Him and seen Him; He’s laid His hand over you many times, but of course, you can’t prove anything  
You have no knowledge; you just make claims based on personal stories that aren’t even particularly good  
And your so-called miracles I debunk with quick and  
Childlike investigations on Google  
Look, I appreciate freedom of speech  
I have religious friends too and don’t want to hurt anyone here  
But this topic has occupied me for a while  
And if I’m honest, I consider every line justified  
And I won’t shy away from mentioning anything in my texts, so maybe  
It would be better if you skip the next part  
Are you sensitive and irritable with sharp criticism?  
You reject every proof out of principle  
You’re not believers; you’re naive slaves of a ruler  
It doesn’t matter if it’s God, Allah, or Shiva  
Theistic religions offer nothing at all - for anyone  
Faith is not rational but emotional and instinctive  
That makes you stubborn, unteachable, and naive  
And you babble about quotes from the Quran and the Bible  
And still think you’re referring to facts  
Those are just barbaric passages and chapters full of war, immoral and even poorly written  
Literary pesticides. Those are not facts  
They are fables and legends, and nothing is proven  
This isn’t excessively exaggerated; just read  
Romans 1, Exodus 21, and Luke 12  
Leviticus 26, Isaiah 13  
1 Timothy 6, Numbers 35, and so on  
Nothing is open to interpretation  
Your God is alongside murderers and tyrants, just another fool, and might send me to eternal fire for these lines  
But that doesn’t make Him any less ridiculous  
And you celebrate Him? - Why?  
If you think about it, you won’t find a good reason  
And baseless claims are not far from ignorance, and living like that is a refusal of reason  

**[Verse 3]**  
Not believing that God exists  
Doesn’t mean claiming that God doesn’t exist - a little logic lesson, without showing off  
Atheism is a negation, not an antithesis. Vital, essential distrust. Look, just because I don’t believe in X doesn’t mean I believe in the opposite of X  
And I don’t believe in artificially created meaning; I don’t believe things just because they sound like what I want  
But who am I? I can see that you’ve long shared most of my views  
You know it. This isn’t about an anti-attitude - No  
But solely about taking responsibility  
For reality, for the future, for the little ones  
For yourself and human reason in general  
It’s easy. Anyone can do it alone  
Because we all have the information we need at hand down to the detail. And in this country and this time, it’s actually  
Ignorant and unforgivable to refuse the whole thing  
I’m sorry. Face it, you’re all alone but free  
You’re afraid, maybe. You’re
