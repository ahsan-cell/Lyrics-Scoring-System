**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Kany García]  
I wish I could be the same as always  
And I wish I could think that I haven't changed at all  
But it's a lie, you messed up my life  
And I got lost for so long  
I found myself and I won't let go  
Today I want to shout it to the four winds  

[Chorus: Carin Leon & Kany García]  
I thank you  
You did what was best for me  
Your love was a lie, but this one is honest  
And in the end, you didn't even deserve it  
I thank you  
You achieved what cowards achieve  
Living full of regret  
Oh, this love was too big for you  

[Verse 2: Carin Leon]  
I don't even plan to dedicate  
A single breakup song to you  
I’d rather add  
Lemon and salt to this heart  
And the wound faded away as I knew it would  

[Chorus: Kany García, Carin Leon & Both]  
I thank you  
You did what was best for me  
Your love was a lie, but this one is honest  
And in the end, you didn't even deserve it  
And I thank you  
You achieved what cowards achieve  
Living full of regret  
Oh, this love was too big for you  

[Verse 2: Carin Leon, Kany García & Carin Leon]  
And you who said I couldn't live without you  
Now look for any reason  
To keep talking about me  
Oh, love  
What a desire to break my heart  

[Pre-Chorus: Kany García, Carin Leon & Both]  
And I thank you  
You did what was best for me  
Your love was a lie, but this one is honest  
And in the end, you didn't even deserve it  

[Chorus: Carin Leon & Kany García]  
I thank you  
You achieved what cowards achieve  
Living full of regret  
Oh, this love was too big for you  

[Outro: Kany García & Carin Leon]  
Living full of regret  
Oh, this love was too big for you  
Oh, you didn’t care at all
