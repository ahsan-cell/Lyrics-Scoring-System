**[Verse]**  
They say life is short and soon it will pass me by  
But the hours stretch long when I try to start again  
Processing that I'm not myself cuts deep, but I have to endure  
This goodbye won't kill me, ah, but how it’s going to hurt (Where's my daddy?)  
Imagining and turning over what can no longer be  
I hate being the one in this story who leaves and won’t return (Why isn't my daddy here?)

**[Chorus]**  
I’ll be that puzzle missing pieces  
A mere clown with a face full of sadness  
A king without a queen, that's how you leave me  
You’ll be that thorn I can never pull out  
It didn’t work out, and admitting it makes me angry  
That I can only have you in dreams  
It's hard to forget you  
With the memory, I’ll have to settle

**[Instrumental Interlude]**

**[Chorus]**  
I’ll be that puzzle missing pieces  
A mere clown with a face full of sadness  
A king without a queen, that's how you leave me  
You’ll be that thorn I can never pull out  
It didn’t work out, and admitting it makes me angry  
That I can only have you in dreams  
It's hard to forget you  
With the memory, I’ll have to settle
