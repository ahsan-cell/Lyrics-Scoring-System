**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Calle 24, Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
Baby, you drive me crazy  
We didn’t wait for the hotel, right there in the Mercedes  
Looking into your eyes  
Make me yours again, for the last time  
You know I’m wild  
I ordered the stuff on my phone, didn’t take you to Chanel  
I wanted to tease a little  
Now I’ve taken away the craving  
Shots of Henny, baby  
It’s almost six  
And on your skin, I want to get it on  
And really enjoy you, babe  

[Chorus: Calle 24, Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
Baby, what’s up?  
What happened?  
What if we turn off our phones tonight?  
Baby  
So beautiful, and besides that, you’re a good girl  
What’s going on?  

[Interlude: Calle 24, Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
And this is how street love sounds, baby  
Hey, hey, hey  
Let the money keep coming, bro  
The real pressure  
The C, the 2, and the 4, old man  
Fuerza Regida, old man  
And as always, cousin  

[Verse 2: Fuerza Regida, Calle 24 & Chino Pacas]  
Beautiful, light up the joint  
Put on your makeup again  
Don’t let them know what this thug does to you  
Answer that guy, tell him everything’s fine  
Baby, delete the photos  
We took yesterday, naked in the motel  
With the red lights on  
Barbie, a porn model  
What eyes, what skin, what a vibe  
The devil made woman, for you I behave  
I know you completely  
Even better than that fool  

[Chorus: Fuerza Regida, Calle 24 & Chino Pacas]  
Baby, what’s up?  
What happened?  
What if we turn off our phones tonight?  
Baby  
So beautiful, and besides that, you’re a good girl  
What’s going on?  

[Outro: Chino Pacas & Fuerza Regida]  
What if we turn off our phones tonight?  
Baby  
What’s going on?
