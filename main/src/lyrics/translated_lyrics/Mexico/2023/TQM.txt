**[Verse 1]**  
From Psycho Bunny to Burberry, smoking pure cherry weed  
Super golden, like the catch of San Judas, the rich girls make me weak  
A little cap like those from the fish market, hiding my gaze  
They know little about me  
Hunting, I’m scoring goals, and at the club they call me "The Baby"  

**[Chorus]**  
They call me "TQM" when they see the BMW  
I’m slicing the cheese from JGL  
Always smelling good, Le Labo wants me  
Making money, Iván’s orders are coming in  

**[Interlude]**  
Hell yeah, old man  
And it’s all Fuerza Regida, old man  
Another level, old man  
As always, screw it  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’m already partying and it feels like a feast  
I want to wake up looking at this girl  
Little dog, be careful, don’t act foolish  
And this princess is asking for a kiss  
Five rings are for unexpected surprises to get me out of here  
Heading to the apartment, "Pepas" is playing  
I’m feeling like Travis, bring me Kylie  

**[Chorus]**  
They call me "TQM" when they see the BMW  
I’m slicing the cheese from JGL  
Always smelling good, Le Labo wants me  
Making money, Iván’s orders are coming in  

**[Outro]**  
Long live the mafia, old man  
Street Mob Records  
SM Company  
We’re still generating, cousin
