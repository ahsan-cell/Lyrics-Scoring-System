**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Neton Vega & Peso Pluma]  
Look, who would have thought?  
The kid has risen up high  
He’s overflowing with talent  
He’s escaped from many while riding in the patrol  
The desire to improve haunts me at night  
I’m still the same, just changed my plans and the buzz surrounds me  
And suddenly we’re off to party  
Because today I can do what I love  
The two-faced ones fall at my feet  
And the worst part is that there are plenty of them

[Chorus: Peso Pluma]  
I’d die if you’re not here  
Come over here, my girl, mama  
Come on, call me on my cell  
I want to caress you and run my fingers through your hair

[Interlude: Peso Pluma & Neton Vega]  
Just like that, buddy Neton, so you know, old man  
And this is how the Doble P sounds, old man  
Pull your hair back

[Verse 2: Peso Pluma]  
I’ve learned everything from the old man, standing firm with his flag  
Forbidden to say his name, he travels the world and takes off in his jet  
Feel the danger and draw the Glock  
I won’t say the name in case you wonder  
One of grape flavor, I’m about to light up  
He’s escaped from many while riding in the patrol  

[Chorus: Neton Vega]  
I’d die if you’re not here  
Come over here, my girl, mama  
Call me, hit me up on my cell  
I want to caress you and run my fingers through your hair
