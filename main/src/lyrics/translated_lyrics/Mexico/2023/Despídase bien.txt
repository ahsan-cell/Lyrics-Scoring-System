**[Verse 1]**  
Forgive me for being who I am  
It's just that you never unblocked me  
I left you a letter today  
Where you always parked  
I don't deserve your forgiveness  
Maybe this won't change anything  
On your side, it's over, but  
On my side, it’s not done yet  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I don’t know what hurt more  
Failing you or knowing you won’t return  
With you, I felt what I felt with no one else  
And it ended just like the others  

**[Chorus]**  
I wish I could love you  
But I just don’t know how to do it  
Maybe in another life  
I’ll have a heart that works  
To find you and make this turn out right  
I wish I could love you  
But I just don’t know how to do it  
And if that day was  
The goodbye  
Then come and say goodbye properly  

**[Verse 2]**  
So I don’t keep your memory  
If I go out with another girl  
I leave, but I always come back  
One returns to where they were happy  
I spend my time smoking weed  
To see if the smoke reaches my heart  
And once and for all, I forget about you  
And what we had  
The fridge is full, but we always ate it all  
The sex didn’t end until we fell asleep  
It’s false what they say out there  
That I never loved you  
And all the damage I did to you and to myself  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I don’t know what hurt more  
Failing you or knowing you won’t return  
With you, I felt what I felt with no one else  
And it ended just like the others  

**[Chorus]**  
I wish I could love you  
But I just don’t know how to do it  
Maybe in another life  
I’ll have a heart that works  
To find you and make this turn out right  
I wish I could love you  
But I just don’t know how to do it  
And if that day was  
The goodbye  
Then come and say goodbye properly  
(No, no, no, oh)  

**[Outro]**  
It seems  
My faithful heart  
Once and again  
Again and again  
I saw you stumble  
On the same stone, on the same stone  
And I know that’s just how you are
