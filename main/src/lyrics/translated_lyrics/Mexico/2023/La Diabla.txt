**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I can eat you up just the way you like  
If only you let yourself be loved  
When it’s hot, I’m coming for you  
Girl, I won’t bite, don’t be scared  
There’s no more time to waste  
You only live once  

[Chorus]  
I’m the bad influence and you liked that  
You’re a naughty girl, it shows, my love  
You’re a little devil, look at how you dance  
On a scale from one to ten, you’re a million  
If you come with me, it’s all Christian Dior  
Fendi, Balenciaga, I’ve got plenty of cash for you  
Whatever you want, my love  
My beautiful princess, I’ll bring down the moon for you  
And if you let me, you’ll see that no one will give you what I’m going to give you  

[Interlude]  
You’re a little devil  

[Chorus]  
I’m the bad influence and you liked that  
You’re a naughty girl, it shows, my love  
You’re a little devil, look at how you dance  
On a scale from one to ten, you’re a million  
If you come with me, it’s all Christian Dior  
Fendi, Balenciaga, I’ve got plenty of cash for you  
Whatever you want, my love  
My beautiful princess, I’ll bring down the moon for you  
And if you let me, you’ll see that no one will give you what I’m going to give you
