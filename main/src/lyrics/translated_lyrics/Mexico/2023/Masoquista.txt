**[Intro]**  
Low-low, low, low  
The one from—  
Low-low, low, low  
Haha  
Low, low  

**[Verse 1]**  
The girl is all in, she’s ready to clash, the real deal  
I seduced that TikToker with Keta  
Look, the baby’s in a hurry to get it on  
My Mexican girl, come on dude, I really like you  
I know you’re a little wild, babe, you’re a tease  
You kept all our story in your notebook  
I like mischievous girls like you, my restless girl  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
This Martian is envying your planet  
I’ve scored the kilos, I’ve got them stashed away  
You can take a lot, babe, you’re like an athlete  
Just stepping in and you’ll see how she tightens up  
And you’d see the piercings she has even on her chest  
In affection, you add to me, girl, you don’t subtract  
That horse keeps pulling my cart  
Because Bomber is eating like DZ (Little Witch)  

**[Chorus]**  
You undressing slowly  
You’d see the photo she posts on her OnlyFans  
You’re mine, you’re sweet  
Your face screams money  
You undressing slowly  
The crazy one still in love with her OG  
Oh, if you’re alone just call me  
If you’re hot, you can have me  

**[Verse 2]**  
Let’s keep a secret about that (sex)  
Come on, babe, hide the kiss  
You call me all night, seems like love from a prisoner  
Minnie Mouse is munching on that cheese  
Let’s record and release our second porno  
I didn’t hurt you, it was your surroundings that did (your surroundings)  
That boyfriend of yours is just for show  
You’re a masochist, you want it hard to the core  
For writing you a song, I always get caught up  
What I feel, I don’t hide  
She found out I’m with you, now she’s suffering from distress  
Let her ask me, babe, I’ll respond  

**[Chorus]**  
You undressing slowly  
You’d see the photo she posts on her OnlyFans  
You’re mine, you’re sweet  
Your face screams money  
You undressing slowly  
The crazy one still in love with her OG (Yeah-ah)  
Oh, if you’re alone just call me (Na-na-na-na)  
If you’re hot, you can have me  

**[Verse 3]**  
If you fell in love, babe, I don’t blame you  
You read hidden feelings  
I turned that demon around and she came for the cult  
I’m a dog, babe, I don’t work out  
Oh, tell her what happened in Cartagena  
That I made love to her in the sand  
Out of depression, she cut her vein  
And another sailor eats my— eh-eh  
When with my milk you get dirty  
We light up some herb and you get feisty  
Just imagine me having you on all fours  
Her face smashed against the showcase  
This little fire is asking for gasoline  
That little hole is asking for Vaseline  
That’s trouble with the cops, I thought it was flour  
Again she wants it, dancer  
Your face, Versace, I put feelings into it like El Tachi  
Tekashi sponsors you, and outside your house serenades like a mariachi  
Girl, if I end up in jail and I didn’t see you here  
Oh, babe, I didn’t see you here  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
This Martian is envying your planet  
I’ve scored the kilos, I’ve got them stashed away  
You can take a lot, babe, you’re like an athlete  
Just stepping in and you’ll see how she tightens up  
And you’d see the piercings she has even on her chest  
In affection, you add to me, girl, you don’t subtract  
That horse keeps pulling my cart  
Because Bomber is eating like DZ (Little Witch)  

**[Chorus]**  
You undressing slowly  
You’d see the photo she posts on her OnlyFans  
You’re mine, you’re sweet  
Your face screams money  
You undressing slowly  
The crazy one still in love with her OG (Mmm)  
Oh, if you’re alone just call me (Na, na)  
If you’re hot, you can have me  

**[Outro]**  
Na-ah-ah  
Ah, ah-ah  
The one from— the one from— the one from— mmm  
What does Keiden say? Haha  
And the best producer from Panama, Bombermusik  
JM, daddy,
