**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
With my cap tilted, eyes half-closed, I’m carrying a big load  
Crazy dude, that’s what they say I am  
The guys are feeling it, if the windows go down, there’s a cloud of smoke  
The scent of pure flowers fills the air  
I’ve got missed calls, my girl has called me several times  
She wants me to come back home  
And if she thinks she’s lost me, no worries, I’ve got her friend right here  
And she moves way better, way better  

[Chorus]  
I don’t have you here by my side, but I’m having a blast  
It’s been four days partying, locked up, I’m going wild  
Going wild, it’s not for love, this wildness  

[Interlude]  
Tito Double P  
This wildness, my dude  
Oh, mama  

[Verse 2]  
Pedal to the metal, speeding, I’ve got my Rolex shining bright  
And behind me comes a convoy (Convoy)  
The guys are feeling it, with the tips showing, you can see the armored ride  
And in the apartment, it’s a blowout  
It’s started, so get ready, the ladies will arrive heated up  
And here come two for Miguelón  
Don’t fall asleep, crew, because here come girls worth half a million  
On TikTok, the best of the best, the best of the best  

[Chorus]  
I don’t have you here by my side, but I’m having a blast  
It’s been four days partying, locked up, I’m going wild  
Going wild, it’s not for love, this wildness  

[Outro Instrumental]
