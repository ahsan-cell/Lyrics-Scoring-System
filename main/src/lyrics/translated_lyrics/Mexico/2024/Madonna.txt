**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Óscar Maydon & Natanael Cano]  
Yves Saint Laurent, and if it’s not Dior, don’t call it  
You love all the details, and that’s where I come in  
Your suitors, from businessmen to traffickers  
Those nobodies don’t scare me  
With me, you’ll be alright  

[Chorus: Óscar Maydon & Natanael Cano]  
And I don’t even know where to start  
You tamed my wild instinct  
How many Rolexes do I need to buy?  
Just a little kiss  
I send money to your parents  
I’d move the world just for you  
You’re Madonna in today’s world  
My blonde girl with a rockstar vibe  

[Interlude: Natanael Cano & Óscar Maydon]  
Yeah!  
Just so you know how much I love you, girl  
And your buddy Óscar Maydon!  

[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & Óscar Maydon]  
Birkin bag, I took a shot to buy it  
Don’t worry about the cash, you’re worth that and more  
Lady Gaga, won’t drink unless it’s with champagne  
The windows fog up quickly, you kiss me while driving  

[Chorus: Natanael Cano & Óscar Maydon]  
And I don’t even know where to start  
You tamed my wild instinct  
How many Rolexes do I need to buy?  
Just a little kiss  
I send money to your parents  
I’d move the world just for you  
You’re Madonna in today’s world  
My blonde girl with a rockstar vibe  

[Outro: Óscar Maydon]  
Uh!  
My blonde girl with a rockstar vibe  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)  
(Ah-ah-ah)
