**[Intro]**  
What's up?  
We're vibing  
Summer has begun  
Fire  

**[Chorus]**  
What could it have been?  
If I had met you before  
Surely, you'd be dancing this with me  
Not as friends  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
But as something more  
You make me feel dangerous when you're near  
For just a little kiss, I'd do anything  
Your girlfriend makes me jealous, and though she's beautiful  
Hey!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
No one will treat you like I do  
No one will kiss you like I do  
She's not as hot as I am  
She's shy, but I'm not  
With the desire I have,  
I dare to take both of you  
Today you're hanging out with her  
But, mmm, maybe not later  

**[Chorus]**  
What could it have been?  
If I had met you before  
Surely, you'd be dancing this with me  
Not as friends, hey!  
What could it have been?  
Oh, if I had met you before  
Surely, you'd be dancing this with me  
Not as friends, hey!  

**[Verse]**  
And I see you and don’t know how to act  
Baby, to win you over, I need the manual  
I'll wait for whatever, I won't give up  
I have faith that those little eyes will look at me one day  
I want to marry you  
My name sounds good with your last name  
I'm waiting for the first slip-up  
To introduce you as my husband  
I want to marry you  
My name sounds good with your last name  
I'm waiting for the first slip-up  
To introduce you as my husband  
You haven't understood that  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
No one will treat you like I do  
No one will kiss you like I do  
She's not as hot as I am  
She's shy, but I'm not  
With the desire I have,  
I dare to take both of you  
Today you're hanging out with her  
But (Mmm) maybe not later  

**[Chorus]**  
What could it have been?  
If I had met you before (Hey, how?)  
Surely, you'd be dancing this with me  
Not as friends, no, no, no  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
(What could it have been?)  
(If I had met you before)  
Chiqui-chá, chiqui-chá, chiqui-chá, chiqui-chá (Haha, ah)  
Uh-uh-uh-uh  
(What could it have been?)  
(If I had met you before)
