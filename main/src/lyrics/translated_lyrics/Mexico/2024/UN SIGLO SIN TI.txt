**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Chayanne & Luck Ra]  
A thousand and one stories I've made up  
To be here, here by your side  
And you don't realize that  
I no longer know what to do  
I know you think I haven't been sincere  
I know you think there's no remedy for me anymore  
But who would have told me  
That without you, I don't know how to live?  

[Pre-Chorus: Luck Ra]  
And now that you're not here  
I realize how much I miss you  

[Chorus: Chayanne & Luck Ra]  
If I've let you down, I ask for forgiveness in the only way I know  
By opening the doors of my heart for when you decide to return  
Because there will never be anyone who can fill the void you left in me  
You've changed my life, you've made me grow, I'm not the same as I was yesterday  

[Post-Chorus: Chayanne & Luck Ra]  
One day is a century without you  

[Interlude: Luck Ra]  
That's right!  
Quartet, old school  

[Verse 2: Luck Ra & Chayanne]  
A thousand and one stories I've made up  
To show you that I've changed  
What happened is in the past  
Let's rescue what united us  
We all learn from our mistakes  
I only ask you to forgive me now  
But who would have told me  
How hard it is to live?  

[Pre-Chorus: Chayanne]  
And now that you're not here  
I realize how much I miss you  

[Chorus: Luck Ra & Chayanne]  
If I've let you down, I ask for forgiveness in the only way I know  
By opening the doors of my heart for when you decide to return  
Because there will never be anyone who can fill the void you left in me  
You've changed my life, you've made me grow, I'm not the same as I was yesterday  

[Post-Chorus: Chayanne & Luck Ra]  
One day is a century without you
