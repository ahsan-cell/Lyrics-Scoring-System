**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Peso Pluma & Gabito Ballesteros]  
Red wine to heal the wounds  
And I can’t forget there were no tortillas  
This bad life has come to an end  
My mind is burning bright  
Peeling potatoes, but they’re not for soup  
I saw they didn’t do well on their own  
Many forgot that I lent a hand  
It’s not the same if I’m pulling with someone else  

[Pre-Chorus: Natanael Cano]  
Only I know about fragile wine  
I spent a long time parked  
I’m not the same as yesterday because today is like this  
Still, some call me chill  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma, Gabito Ballesteros & Natanael Cano]  
And little by little, the M starts to hit me  
And with a sip of water, I’m going to reactivate  
Let the techno play, I’m in festival mode  
And I love to enjoy  
Between the millionaire and Eladio, I’ll be listening  
I’m rolling 77 with Coco Chanel, my dad  
My hair long like Don Pablo Escobar  
And what stress? I’m relaxed  

[Interlude: Natanael Cano, Gabito Ballesteros & Peso Pluma]  
A-a-ay, buddy  
¡Uh!  
I’m relaxed  
Up with the Doble P, my old man  
Buddy, Gabito  
I’m rela-a-a-a-x  
Just like that, buddy Peso  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah  
Pure Doble P, old man  
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

[Verse 2: Gabito Ballesteros & Natanael Cano]  
And it doesn’t bother me that they’re throwing shade  
Green is life, and green is what we carry  
When have you seen the bosses crying?  
Here we are men, not clowns  
Plan A was to make money  
Plan B was how to waste it  
Plan C was with cocaine  
Jewels, women, and adrenaline  

[Pre-Chorus: Peso Pluma]  
Only I know about fragile wine  
For a long time, I was parked  
I’m not the same as yesterday because today is like this  
Still, some call me chill  

[Chorus: Natanael Cano, Gabito Ballesteros & Peso Pluma]  
And little by little, the M starts to hit me  
And with a sip of water, I’m going to activate  
Let the techno play, I’m in festival mode  
And I love to enjoy  
Between the millionaire and Eladio, I’ll be listening  
I’m rolling 77 with Coco Chanel, my dad  
My hair long like Don Pablo Escobar  
And what stress? I’m relaxed  

[Outro: Natanael Cano, Gabito Ballesteros & Peso Pluma]  
¡Eah!  
And pure Tumbados Corridos  
A-A-Ando rela-a-a-a-x  
To hell with it (¡Uh!)  
I’m rela-a-a-a-x  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
