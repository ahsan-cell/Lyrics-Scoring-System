**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Óscar Maydon & Junior H]  
You’re not my love, you’re my life  
Give me your attention, just one more time  
Is it the solution or is it the end?  
It depends on you, I’m here to add  
It’s just gossip, my love, can’t you see?  
Come on, please, everything’s normal, you’ll see  
I don’t know what happened, or who hurt you  
In the future, your husband is me  

[Chorus: Óscar Maydon & Junior H]  
I don’t even know why the hell you keep fighting  
When I spoil you with dogs, with beaches, with clubs  
I give you my time, my money, my essence, and my all  
I don’t even understand you anymore, honestly, I can’t take it  
I want to take you back to the moment we met  
I sent you a drink, then we became friends  
I wish I could travel to the past and kiss you hard  
So that in the future, there are no damn fights  

[Post-Chorus: Óscar Maydon]  
Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh  
Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh  
Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh  
Woh-oh  

[Interlude: Óscar Maydon & Junior H]  
Uh!  
And just like that, little one  
(Uh!, Uh!, Uh!)  
And your buddy Óscar Maydon  
Here it goes, buddy Óscar  
All Junior H  

[Verse 2: Junior H & Óscar Maydon]  
What things, my love, do I like about you?  
Your body is one, and seeing you smile too  
I’m not romantic, but if it’s for you  
I’ll play "THE SONG," the one by J Balvin  
I thought I had forgotten you  
But they played that damn song  
2033, everything is over  
But forever together, just us two  

[Chorus: Junior H & Óscar Maydon]  
I don’t even know why the hell you keep fighting  
When I spoil you with dogs, with beaches, with clubs  
I give you my time, my money, my essence, and my all  
I don’t even understand you anymore, honestly, I can’t take it  
I want to take you back to the moment we met  
I sent you a drink, then we became friends  
I wish I could travel to the past and kiss you hard  
So that in the future, there are no damn fights  

[Post-Chorus: Óscar Maydon]  
Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh  
Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh  
Woh-oh, woh-oh-oh-oh  
Woh-oh
