**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've already forgotten you  
I'm free once again  
I’m flying back to my life  
That’s far away and forbidden for you  
I've already forgotten you  
You’re so far from me now  
You succeeded in hurting me  
Wounding me and turning me into who knows what  

**[Chorus]**  
You caught me, you had me in your hands  
You showed me the inhumane and how unhappy you can be  
You pretended to be truly in love  
Even though you never loved me, I know it  
You told me I could never forget you  
That later I would beg you and ask you to "kiss me"  
I fought against the love I had for you, and it faded away  
And now I've already forgotten you  

**[Instrumental Interlude]**  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've already forgotten you  
You’re so far from me now  
You succeeded in hurting me  
Wounding me and turning me into who knows what  

**[Chorus]**  
You caught me, you had me in your hands  
You showed me the inhumane and how unhappy you can be  
You pretended to be truly in love  
Even though you never loved me, I know it  
You told me I could never forget you  
That later I would beg you and ask you to "kiss me"  
I fought against the love I had for you, and it faded away  
And now I've already forgotten you  

**[Outro]**  
And now I've already forgotten you
