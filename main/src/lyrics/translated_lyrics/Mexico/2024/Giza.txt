**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verse 1: Óscar Maydon & Natanael Cano]  
I light it up, spark the joint  
And in bed, she asks for more  
Her movements so sensual (Sensual)  
A goddess with me, a moon for all  
An ecstasy when you look at her  
A goddess for a mortal  

[Chorus: Óscar Maydon & Natanael Cano]  
I built you an altar, you're the tip of the Giza  
You're a gift of myrrh, do you understand?  
Just tell me what you intend  
Nights in a motel, I want to play cards and get close  
I want you to be my woman, do you understand?  
Just tell me what you intend  

[Interlude: Óscar Maydon & Natanael Cano]  
Uh!  
Just say what we should do, girl  
Eah!  
And well pulled together  
And your buddy Óscar Maydon  

[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & Óscar Maydon]  
With Persian or Babylonian eyes  
They just tempt me to sin, mixing fire with the sea  
Not even a fool dares to approach  
Because they’re afraid to spend  
That’s why she’s with me  

[Chorus: Natanael Cano & Óscar Maydon]  
I built you an altar, you're the tip of the Giza  
You're a gift of myrrh, do you understand?  
Just tell me what you intend  
Nights in a motel, I want to play cards and get close  
I want you to be my woman, do you understand?  
Just tell me what you intend
