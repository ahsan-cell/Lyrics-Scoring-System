**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
This is real gangsta love, love  
This is real gangsta love, love  
This is real gangsta love, love  
This is real gangsta love, love (Love)  
This is real—

**[Verse 1]**  
Baby, this is real gangsta love  
Just knowing you won’t leave is enough for me (Ah-ah)  
We left the neighborhood, chasing the plate, the money, and the pasta  
Time, time, it gets what it needs, but it doesn’t waste it  
Less for those who don’t have the drive (No)  
You prefer my style, old school, Blockbuster (Uh)  
I give one love like a rasta  
Baby, what do you want from me?  
I’m coming out of the dressing room (Uh-huh, I’ll be there)  
Heading towards your fantasy (Hahaha, shh), oh  
Baby, what do you want from me? (Haha)  
Tell me what you want to be  
Only real gangsta stuff, baby girl  

**[Chorus]**  
This is real gangsta love  
Whatever you want, I’ll give it to you, put it on, put it on  
This is real gangsta love  
Ra-pa-pa-pa-pa-pam-pam, a shot to the heart  
This is real gangsta love  
Yeah, yeah, jump, she comes from the hood, with sweetness, pom-pom  
This is real gangsta love  
And she doesn't need a gun, baby, let’s get it on  
This is real  

**[Verse 2]**  
Gangsta love  
Mommy, I give you my vandal heart  
Take it all, spend it  
What do you have for me?  
I have everything for you  
The girl from the Bronx caused the blackout (Oh, oh)  
She told her boyfriend their relationship was over (No)  
And he stayed quiet, ha, like Papa Doc  
She wants me to take her to the Galapagos Islands, ha, yeah  

**[Bridge]**  
This is real gangsta love  
Ga-Ga-Ga-Gangsta girl, gangsta gyal  
She moves like this, everything here is about to explode  
It’s not right, it’s not wrong  
Mommy, let’s make your story real  
Gangsta girl (Gangsta girl), gangsta gyal  
She moves like this, everything here is about to explode (Uh)  
It’s not right, it’s not wrong  

**[Chorus]**  
This is real gangsta love  
Whatever you want, I’ll give it to you, put it on, put it on  
This is real gangsta love  
Ra-pa-pa-pa-pa-pam-pam, a shot to the heart (Love)  
This is real gangsta love  
Yeah, yeah, jump, she comes from the hood, with sweetness, bombón  
This is real gangsta love  
She doesn't need a gun, baby, let’s get it on (Love, love)  
This is real gangsta love
