**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Tito Double P]  
One, two, three  
One, two, three  

[Verse 1: Peso Pluma & Tito Double P]  
A few drinks for the belly  
That little bird, honestly, just won’t come down  
I’m feeling stuck because you won’t tell me what’s up  
Two days angry, two days you haven’t spoken to me  
Another one of your antics  
I’m here with the guys and you’re always overreacting  
When you say "I love you," girl, I just don’t believe a thing  
Everything I had planned went straight to hell  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Tito Double P]  
Look at what I’ve become  
I love the stacks, I’m crazy for the money  
Baby, I warned you  
That when I’m alone, I’m a total mess  
It wasn’t me, it was you  
That made me addicted to this wild life  
Check out what I’ve got  
A ton of girls and not one fills me up  

[Interlude: Tito Double P & Peso Pluma]  
Oh, mama  
Tito Double P, ah  
This is how the damn Double P sounds, buddy Tito  
Oh-oh-oh  
Bye  

[Verse 2: Peso Pluma & Tito Double P]  
The high doesn’t even hit me anymore  
You answer half-heartedly, my girl, just tell me what’s going on  
I remembered the nights we had fun in your living room  
Well, I stopped by your house and said hi to your mom  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Tito Double P]  
Look at what I’ve become  
I love the stacks, I’m crazy for the money  
Baby, I warned you  
That when I’m alone, I’m a total mess  
It wasn’t me, it was you  
That made me addicted to this wild life  
Check out what I’ve got  
A ton of girls and not one fills me up
