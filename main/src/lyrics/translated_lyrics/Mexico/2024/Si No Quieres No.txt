**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Luis R Conriquez]  
Damn it, son of a bitch!

[Verse 1: Luis R Conriquez & Neton Vega]  
If the Guzmán send me, I’ll make a mess right away  
It’s not easy here; I’m on guard for the bosses  
Patience isn’t my thing, I pray to the devil and also to death  
Only a few know I like my beer warm  
I love fast cars; honestly, there’s no other like the Shelby  
At Archivaldo's command, we handle anyone who resists  
Without needing to fly away, my pilot and a Baby always in the clouds  
When I’m on the street, I carry gear and my buddy working up front  

[Chorus: Luis R Conriquez & Neton Vega]  
If you don’t want to, no, if you don’t want to, no  
Get your act together if I’m in the area  
Long hair and wearing a big watch  
Of fine diamonds, if you don’t want to, no  

[Interlude: Luis R Conriquez & Neton Vega]  
Come on, buddy Netón  
Damn it, son of a bitch!  
And if you don’t want to, no  
Pull your hair back  

[Verse 2: Neton Vega & Luis R Conriquez]  
With cold blood, nerves steady, smoking a hitman’s joint  
There you see me in the capital, always alert  
Riding in the armored cars so that the bullets don’t hit us  
Pure brave Comanches, they don’t think twice  
And just to mention, I’m always at a hundred  
A blonde and a dark one, don’t play too much or I’ll pull out the dragon  
If it’s not grape, let it be coconut  
But it better be washed, if you don’t want to, no  

[Chorus: Neton Vega & Luis R Conriquez]  
If you don’t want to, no, if you don’t want to, no  
They see us rushing because we’re out of control  
Long hair and in a big Chevy  
With tinted windows and inside a stash
