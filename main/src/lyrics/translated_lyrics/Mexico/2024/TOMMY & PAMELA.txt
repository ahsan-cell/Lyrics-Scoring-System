**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kenia Os]  
The Martians, baby

[Chorus: Peso Pluma]  
Baby, let me in  
In your little panties, I want you sensual  
So we can grind all night, come on, let’s dance  
Let the chains keep shining on us  
Bad reputation, good life  
Counting the cash  
In the garage, my Lambos don’t fit anymore  
The .40 diamond-studded  
I’ve got connections, I’m everywhere  
Like Pablo and Gustavo  
I’ve got stash spots with bills saved up  
The Barbies say it’s a heavy scene  
So much money, how do I manage?

[Verse 1: Kenia Os]  
Tonight we’re getting freaky, six plus nine, repeat  
And we end up grinding against the wall  
I’m the strawberry in your Martini, tonight I’m feeling greedy  
I’m only wearing Chanel sweat  
5 a.m. and I’m on top of you  
My Tiffany earrings are shining  
We park to do it in the back seat  
Tonight I’m ready for you (-you)  
5 a.m. and I’m on top of you  
My Tiffany earrings are shining  
We park to do it in the back seat  
Tonight I’m ready for you (For you)

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Kenia Os]  
We both know it’s wrong  
We’ll steal a moment to smoke  
Hidden away, she sees me  
She’s not the official one, and we don’t call each other “baby”  
We both know it’s wrong  
We’ll steal a moment to smoke  
Hidden away, she sees me  
She’s not the official one, and we don’t call each other “baby”

[Verse 2: Kenia Os]  
Quietly so no one sees us-eas-eas  
I’ll take away your stress, let your ex not find out  
So no one sees us-eas-eas  
Let’s film the sequel to Tommy and Pamela’s sex tape  
Quietly so no one sees us-eas-eas  
I’ll take away your stress, let your ex not find out  
So no one sees us-eas-eas  
Let’s film the sequel to Tommy and Pamela’s sex tape

[Chorus: Peso Pluma]  
Baby, let me in  
In your little panties, I want you sensual  
So we can grind all night, come on, let’s dance  
Let the chains keep shining on us  
Bad reputation, good life  
Counting the cash  
In the garage, my Lambos don’t fit anymore  
The .40 diamond-studded  
I’ve got connections, I’m everywhere  
Like Pablo and Gustavo  
I’ve got stash spots with bills saved up  
The Barbies say it’s a heavy scene  
So much money, how do I manage?

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Kenia Os, Kenia Os]  
We both know it’s wrong (We both know)  
We’ll steal a moment to smoke (To smoke, to smoke)  
Hidden away, she sees me (Eh, eh)  
She’s not the official one, and we don’t call each other “baby” (We don’t call each other baby)  
We both know it’s wrong (We both know)  
We’ll steal a moment to smoke (To smoke, to smoke)  
Hidden away, she sees me  
She’s not the official one, and we don’t call each other “baby”

[Outro: Kenia Os]  
The Double P, K Os  
The flag, baby  
Chris Jedi, ah, ah  
Gaby Music  
The Martians, baby
