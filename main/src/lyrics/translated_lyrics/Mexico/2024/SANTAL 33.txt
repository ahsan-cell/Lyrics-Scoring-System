**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Óscar Maydon & Peso Pluma]**  
Santal 33, Porsche Cayenne  
I’m wearing the Travis now  
Hello, mademoiselle, I’m all set  
It would be, but it drives me wild  

**[Verse 1: Óscar Maydon & Peso Pluma]**  
On the private jet, Rosé champagne  
My luxuries don’t surprise her  
And like Mbappé at twenty-three  
I also celebrated with the glasses  

**[Refrain: Óscar Maydon & Peso Pluma]**  
Give me more of that madness that always makes me feel alive  
In bed, you awaken my animal instinct  
Never satisfied, she always asks for more  
More and more  
I hold the record for sinning always with you  
And you know well that we’re not friends  
We’re here because we both wanted to  
Indulge me tonight  
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  

**[Interlude: Peso Pluma & Óscar Maydon]**  
Old man, pure Doble P, screw it, just so they know  
At home, we have more, buddy Peso  
And his buddy Óscar Maydon  

**[Verse 2: Óscar Maydon & Peso Pluma]**  
Containers full of flavors  
Flowers come to me, and I also get memories of loves  
Heartbreakers  
My weapons scare her  
I can see it on your face, relax, baby  
When I’m with you, I don’t like to use them  
You kill it all by yourself  

**[Chorus: Óscar Maydon & Peso Pluma]**  
Santal 33, Porsche Cayenne  
I’m wearing the Travis now  
Hello, mademoiselle, I’m all set  
It would be, but it drives me wild  

**[Refrain: Óscar Maydon & Peso Pluma]**  
Give me more of that madness that always makes me feel alive  
In bed, you awaken my animal instinct  
Never satisfied, she always asks for more  
More and more  
I hold the record for sinning always with you  
And you know well that we’re not friends  
We’re here because we both wanted to  
Seduce me tonight  
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
