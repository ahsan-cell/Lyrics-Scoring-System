**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Neton Vega & Tito Double P]  
I’m yours, until I die  
With that booty you have, tell me, who wouldn’t want you?  
Hey, yeah, you, this nigga’s for you  
With that melon you’re carrying, you’re definitely going viral on YouTube  
Call whenever you want, at whatever time you choose  
You don’t need a reason, it’s just a matter of wanting to  
How well she moves it, how well she moves it  
They’re not fake, they grew on the girl  
I’m yours, even if you don’t believe it  
If I call you, don’t say I’m taking her with bitches  
I love you, I-I love you  
You’re single, so beautiful, not everyone is like you  
You-you-you-you  
Calm down, it’ll happen soon  
Turning around, I’m rolling one up  
I’ll do whatever it takes, for you I’ll do anything  
You have no competition  

[Chorus: Neton Vega & Tito Double P]  
Oh, oh, pretty girl, you’re the one, you’re my downfall  
Oh, oh, pretty girl, you’re my drug and you’re my downfall  

[Interlude: Tito Double P]  
Tito Double P  
Oh, mama!  

[Verse 2: Tito Double P & Neton Vega]  
Rolling around, I light a blunt  
I control the rhythm and bring the flow  
With Neton, the show is lit  
Come on, girl, if you don’t want to, that’s fine  
The Nike shoes, they’re Air Force 1  
So you can move it, back and forth  
Side to side, I can’t stop looking at it  
That little butt has me completely hooked  
I have what you want  
If several girls are looking for me  
There are connections and there’s cash  
To enjoy the pleasures  
Say “what a badass track this is”  
It’s pretty wild, that’s why I carry a gun  
My eyes are red  
I’m chill right now, the party hasn’t blown up yet  

[Chorus: Tito Double P & Neton Vega]  
Oh, oh, pretty girl, you’re the one, you’re my downfall  
Oh, oh, pretty girl, you’re my drug and you’re my downfall  

[Interlude: Neton Vega]  
Tito Double P  

[Verse 3: Tito Double P & Neton Vega]  
I have what you want  
If several girls are looking for me  
There are connections and there’s cash  
To enjoy the pleasures  
Come on, I know you want it  
For me to take you in the Mercedes  
Tell the guy you have, tell him you don’t want him anymore  
Rolling around, I light a blunt  
I control the rhythm and bring the flow  
With Nickon, the show is lit  
Come on, girl, if you don’t want to, that’s fine  
You-you-you-you  
Calm down, it’ll happen soon  
Turning around, I’m rolling one up  
I’ll do whatever it takes, for you I’ll do anything  
No worries, no competition  

[Chorus: Tito Double P & Neton Vega]  
Oh, oh, pretty girl, you’re the one, you’re my downfall  
Oh, oh, pretty girl, you’re the one, you’re my downfall
