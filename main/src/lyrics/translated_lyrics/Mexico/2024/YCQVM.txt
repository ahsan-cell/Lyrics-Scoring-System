**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Natanael Cano & Brandon Dugay]  
I think it’s all gone to hell, you don’t even reply to my messages  
I’ve had a few drinks and I’m thinking about how to forget you  
Baby, give me another chance, tonight you and I are going to go for it  
I’ll make you touch the sky when we do it hard, that’s how it goes  
Get on top of me, I’ll let you pull my chains  
You like diamonds like a thug, what’s the game you’re playing?  
There’s no more resentment, come to the Presi, it’s reserved  
Pop the bottle and the girl gets all happy

[Chorus: Natanael Cano & Brandon Dugay]  
Answer the phone, tell me yes or no  
Let’s light it up right now, you and I  
I’m already better, my life has changed  
The tables have turned, I’ve got plenty of options

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & Brandon Dugay]  
I’m rocking white and pink, it’s got me feeling good, all lit up  
Behind me, the red and blue lights flash, I won’t stop  
Don’t say I can’t, I’ll pop off whenever I want  
The horn sounds nice when the cheese is already on the plate  
With a killer flow, my neck’s frozen solid  
And things heat up when you and I get tangled up  
I think it’s all gone to hell, you don’t reply to any messages  
I’ve had a few drinks and I’m thinking about how to forget you  

[Chorus: Natanael Cano & Brandon Dugay]  
Answer the phone, tell me yes or no  
Let’s light it up right now, you and I  
I’m already better, my life has changed  
The tables have turned, I’ve got plenty of options

[Instrumental Outro]
