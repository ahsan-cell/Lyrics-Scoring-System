**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
Today I thought about going to find you, but no  
Calling you, but no  
Another night, another hotel  
More than three hits have come  
I don’t even know who the crazy girl is  
My Cartier made her fall for me  
Yeah, she's really fine, but no  
Got a nice body, but no  

**[Verse 1]**  
Colombian girls, all tens, my friend  
Chanel, Prada, baby, you light me up, you tease me  
If you want, I’ll get you a Jeep and a house  
Green skins, I love this craziness  

**[Refrain]**  
Baby, it’s that I got lost in your eyes  
Since that night, baby, you’ve got me so crazy  
Whiskey and tequila, and don’t forget the coconut one  
Baby, I’ll touch you, satisfy my craving  

**[Chorus]**  
Today I thought about going to find you, but no  
Calling you, but no  
Another night, another hotel  
More than three hits have come  
I don’t even know who the crazy girl is  
My Cartier made her fall for me  
Yeah, she's really fine, but no  
Got a nice body, but no  

**[Verse 2]**  
You, my little doll, a real expert  
For the party, a master, a pro  
Precious, allergic to latex  
How she moves it, how she moves it (Hard)  
You, my little doll, a real expert  
For the party, a master, a pro  
Precious, allergic to latex  
How she moves it, how she moves it  

**[Refrain]**  
Baby, it’s that I got lost in your eyes  
Since that night, baby, you’ve got me so crazy  
Whiskey and tequila, and don’t forget the coconut one  
Baby, I’ll touch you, satisfy my craving  

**[Outro]**  
You, my little doll, how she moves it, how she moves it
