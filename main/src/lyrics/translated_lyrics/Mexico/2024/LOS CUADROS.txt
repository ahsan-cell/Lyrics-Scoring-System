**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Tito Double P & Peso Pluma]  
When I started, things went really well, now they see me spend  
At a hundred, I broke it down, now from ten, they go ten by ten  
Sit down because I'm going to share some tales that happened to me  
And there are stories to tell, no lies with a blunt of Gelato*  

[Chorus: Peso Pluma]  
They go, they leave  
The paintings, notebooks sail away  
And behind them, sailors on the open sea  

[Interlude: Tito Double P]  
Oh, mama  
Pure Doble P, cousin  

[Verse 2: Peso Pluma & Tito Double P]  
I’ll take good care, just in case the devil's lurking around  
Always two or three by his side, watching over the kid  
I supply the clients each month, they make me count, guaranteed hustle  
A cigarette for the stress sounds good if I’m feeling idle  

[Chorus: Tito Double P]  
They go, they leave  
The paintings, notebooks sail away  
And behind them, sailors on the open sea  

*Gelato refers to a specific strain of cannabis known for its flavor and potency.
