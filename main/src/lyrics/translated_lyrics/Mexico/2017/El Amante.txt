**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I’m already tired, I don’t want to be your lover  
I tell you from my side, I can’t take it anymore  
I can’t stand seeing the other one claim he owns you  
It kills my pride, he doesn’t even know how to talk to you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I made this for him  
When he hears it, I want to be there to see  
When he finds out and knows that I’m the one who has you  
Maybe it sounds a bit wrong, I know, and it doesn’t suit me  
It’s all because of you  

[Chorus]  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours  
I know you feel like you’re mine  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That with him, you feel cold  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours (Oh)  
I know you feel like you’re mine (Ah)  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That he’s a piece of trash  

[Post-Chorus]  
I’ll warm you up, babe, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up, babe, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up more, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up, babe, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up, babe  

[Verse 1]  
Just one thing I’ll ask you  
If you’re cold, who gives you warmth?  
I’m the owner of your fantasies  
No one does it like I do  
If you look pretty, he doesn’t say anything  
And I like you even without makeup  
You always tell me he treats you badly  
And that has to end  

[Bridge]  
Tell me what you’re going to do  
Baby, I have this feeling  
If you want to suffer with him, that’s up to you  
Will you be happy with him? I won’t answer you  
I know you’ll call me when you miss your skin (Your skin)  

[Chorus]  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours  
I know you feel like you’re mine  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That with him, you feel cold  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours (Oh)  
I know you feel like you’re mine (Ah)  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That he’s a piece of trash  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I made this for him  
When he hears it, I want to be there to see  
When he finds out and knows that I’m the one who has you  
Maybe it sounds a bit wrong, I know, and it doesn’t suit me  
It’s all because of you  

[Chorus]  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours  
I know you feel like you’re mine  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That with him, you feel cold  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours (Oh)  
I know you feel like you’re mine (Ah)  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That he’s a piece of trash  

[Post-Chorus]  
I’ll warm you up, babe, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up, babe, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up more, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up, babe, babe, babe  
I’ll warm you up, babe  

[Outro]  
Baby, I feel like I’m yours  
I know you feel like you’re mine (Oh-oh)  
Tell your little boyfriend  
That he’s a piece of trash  
N-I-C-K (Oh)  
Nicky, Nicky, Nicky Jam (Oh)  
Saga WhiteBlack (Oh-oh)

I don’t want to be your lover anymore
