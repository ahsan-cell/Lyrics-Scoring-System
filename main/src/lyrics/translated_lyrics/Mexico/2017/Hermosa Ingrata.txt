**Translated Lyrics:**

Once again, you won't fool me, my love  
This time, I won’t give you my heart  
It’s enough that you played with me  
I was the one to blame for wanting your love  

If I had known just a little  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved with you  
Down that little path  

If I had known just a little  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved with you  
Down that little path  

And you are a beautiful ingrate  
This game of yours isn’t worth it  
From today on, I don’t need you, need you  

And you are a liar  
You’ve turned into something else  
Beautiful but dangerous  
And this is no way to love  

Here I am, while this track plays  
I tell you, love, to those who go, nothing is kept  

It’s enough that you played with me  
I was the one to blame for wanting your love  

If I had known just a little  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved with you  
Down that little path  

If I had known just a little  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved  
I wouldn’t have gotten involved with you  
Down that little path  

And you are a beautiful ingrate  
This game of yours isn’t worth it  
From today on, I don’t need you, need you  

And you are a liar  
You’ve turned into something else  
Beautiful but dangerous  
And this is no way to love  

Here I am, while this track plays  
I tell you, love, to those who go, nothing is kept  

Here I am, while this track plays  
I tell you, love, to those who go, nothing is kept  

And you are a beautiful ingrate  
This game of yours isn’t worth it  
From today on, I don’t need you, need you  

And you are a liar  
You’ve turned into something else  
Beautiful but dangerous  
And this is no way to love  

You are a beautiful ingrate.
