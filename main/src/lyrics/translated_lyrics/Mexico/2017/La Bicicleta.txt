**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Carlos Vives]  
I’m not going to do anything  
Digging through the wounds of the past  
I won’t lose  
I don’t want to be a guy from another place  

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira and Carlos Vives]  
In your way, uncomplicated  
On a bike that takes you everywhere  
A desperate vallenato*  

[Chorus: Carlos Vives & Shakira]  
A little letter that I keep where I wrote to you  
That I dream of you and love you so much  
For a while now, my heart has been beating for you, beating for you  
The one I keep where I wrote to you  
That I dream of you and love you so much  
For a while now, my heart has been beating for you, beating for you  

[Verse 2: Shakira]  
I can be happy  
Walking relaxed among the people  
I want you like this  
And I like you because you’re different  

[Pre-Chorus 2: Carlos Vives]  
In my way, messy  
On a bike that takes me everywhere  
A desperate vallenato  

[Chorus: Carlos Vives & Shakira]  
A little letter that I keep where I wrote to you  
That I dream of you and love you so much  
For a while now, my heart has been beating for you, beating for you  
The one I keep where I wrote to you  
That I dream of you and love you so much  
For a while now, my heart has been beating for you, beating for you  

[Bridge: Carlos Vives & Shakira]  
She’s the favorite, the one who sings in the area  
She moves her hips like a boat on the waves  
She has bare feet like a child who adores  
And her long hair is a sun that tempts you  
She likes to be called the girl, the lola  
She likes to be watched when she dances alone  
She prefers the house where time doesn’t pass  
She likes Barranquilla, she likes Barcelona  
Take me, take me on your bike  
Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike  
I want us to explore that area together  
From Santa Marta to La Arenosa  
Take me, take me on your bike  
So we can play ball and flip-flops over there  
Because if you ever show Piqué the Tayrona**  
He won’t want to leave for Barcelona afterwards  

[Pre-Chorus: Carlos Vives & Shakira]  
In my way, uncomplicated  
On a bike that takes me everywhere  
A desperate vallenato  

[Chorus: Carlos Vives & Shakira]  
A little letter that I keep where I wrote to you  
That I dream of you and love you so much  
For a while now, my heart has been beating for you, beating for you  
The one I keep where I wrote to you  
That I dream of you and love you so much  
For a while now, my heart has been beating for you, beating for you  

[Outro: Shakira]  
Take me, take me on your bike  
Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike  
Because if you ever show Piqué the Tayrona  
He won’t want to leave for Barcelona afterwards  
Take me, take me on your bike  
Listen to me, Carlos, take me on your bike  
Because if you show my Piqué the Tayrona  
He won’t want to leave for Barcelona afterwards
