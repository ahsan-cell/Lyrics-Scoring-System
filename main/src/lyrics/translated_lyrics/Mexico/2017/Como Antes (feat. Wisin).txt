**[Intro: Yandel]**  
Wisin & Yandel!

**[Chorus 1: Yandel]**  
Find me if you want to move your body,  
Relax, it’s the moment, I’ve got you trapped.  
If you’re alone, I’m going to give you,  
Find me if you want to move your body,  
Relax, it’s the moment, I’ve got you trapped.  
If you’re alone, I’m going to give you.

**[Refrain 1: Yandel]**  
Girl, I want to know if you’ll give me  
Just one more night  
To satisfy my craving for your body,  
I miss you.

**[Chorus 2: Yandel]**  
Why do you fight me?  
Why do you ignore me?  
If I was the one who made you a woman.  
You denied me a kiss because I’m a rapper,  
And I don’t understand why.  
Why do you fight me?  
Why do you ignore me?  
If I was the one who made you a woman.  
You denied me a kiss because I’m a rapper,  
And I don’t understand why.

**[Chorus 3: Yandel]**  
I’m tired of calling you (Eoh, eoh)  
I’m tired of begging you.  
I’m tired of waiting for you (Waiting for you; eoh)  
I’m tired of begging you (Eoh).

**[Verse 1: Yandel]**  
Go on, leave with that man (Eoh)  
If he responds, let him take his chance (Eoh)  
Why are you hiding?  
If they already told me you and he are messing around (Eoh).

**[Bridge: Wisin]**  
Cowgirl, the fight has begun (Yo')  
Cowgirl, buckle up your belt.  
Cowgirl, this stallion doesn’t play around.  
Cowgirl, I’m going to make you feel it (Yo'-yo')  
Are you coming with me? Let’s go.

**[Chorus 4: Yandel]**  
People are talking, saying I’m out here smoking,  
The bad herb, the one that takes you away.

**[Interlude: Yandel & Wisin]**  
Hahaha  
Damn, this is good.  
Hey.

**[Verse 2: Wisin]**  
Now I’m into smoking creepy,  
Take a sip from this phillip.  
In the club, smoking real trippy,  
Chilling with girls who are crazy for the fun.

**[Chorus 5: Yandel]**  
Something happened between you and me,  
I don’t know what happened,  
I just know that I feel something.  
Look at me, don’t worry,  
I’m not lying to you.  
Something happened between you and me,  
I don’t know what happened,  
I just know that I feel something.  
Look at me, don’t worry,  
I’m not lying to you.

**[Chorus 6: Yandel]**  
Alone, she finds herself alone,  
Waiting for the hour when night falls.  
Escape, come on, dance.

**[Verse 3: Wisin]**  
It all starts when the father opens the drawer,  
Noticing his daughter is flirty.  
And among the "smart ones" and the combs,  
They find an autograph on a napkin.

**[Interlude: Yandel & Wisin]**  
Jomy!  
This is for respect.  
You know.  
Hahaha  
Blah.

**[Chorus 7: Yandel]**  
The shooters are activated, lero'-lero'  
Oh,  
Ladies, don’t start a fire, lero'-lero'  
I don’t start fires.  
The shooters are activated, lero'-lero'  
Oh,  
Ladies, don’t start a fire, lero'-lero'  
I don’t start fires.

**[Verse 4: Wisin]**  
Hear the dembow, and jump the beat,  
Chubby ones, dance to shake the butter.  
The skinny ones with doll-like grace look like they’re from the block, ready to grind.  
Move forward, tell them to show some respect.  
Come on Wisin, I’m feeling restless.  
Real hard, shake it well.  
Touch me, I’m feeling restless.
