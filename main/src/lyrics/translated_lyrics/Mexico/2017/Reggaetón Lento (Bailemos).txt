**Translated Lyrics:**

How good she looks  
Her figure drives me crazy  
That short little dress fits her well  
Combined with her coffee-colored lipstick  
How good she looks  
Her waist hypnotizes me  
When she dances, even the gods want to see her  
I won’t waste any more time, I’ll get closer  

**[Chorus: Everyone]**  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  

**[Verse 2: Erick & Zadbiel]**  
Let me dance with you to this song  
Among all the women, your beauty stands out  
I love your confidence, you move with skill  
Move it, move it, move it  
So fine, Latina, you’re full of life  
Raise both hands, let’s go up  
Where are the single ladies and those who aren’t, too?  
Don’t be shy, move it, move it, move it  

**[Chorus: Everyone]**  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  

**[Post-Chorus: Everyone]**  
Dance with me  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  

**[Bridge: Richard]**  
I know you like it when I take you to the floor  
I know you like this slow reggaeton  
This ain't stopping baby till I say so  
Come get - come get some more  

**[Verse 3: Zadbiel & Joel]**  
It’s impossible to delay the hours  
Every minute with you is a dream  
I wish I could be your confidant  
Why don’t you dare if we do it now?  
Don’t be shy  
It’s just you and me alone  

**[Chorus: Everyone]**  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  

**[Chorus: Everyone]**  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  
I just looked at her and liked her  
I moved in and invited her: “Let’s dance, eh?”  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  

**[Post-Chorus: Everyone]**  
Move it, move it  
Dance it, dance it  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  
Move it, move it  
Dance it, dance it  
The night is perfect for a slow reggaeton  
One of those that hasn’t been danced in a while  
Who are we?  
CNCO!  

**[Outro: Erick]**  
How good she looks  
Her figure drives me crazy  
That short little dress fits her well  
Combined with her coffee-colored lipstick  
How good she looks
