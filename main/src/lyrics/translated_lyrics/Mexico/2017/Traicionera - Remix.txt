**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Sebastián Yatra)  
You tell me it’s not true that you’re dying for me  
(El remix, el Princi)  
If it’s true that you don’t like me, don’t come close like that  
(Yatra, Yatra)  
They told me you love it, that they’d die for you  
(Cali & El Dandee, yo)  
Looking for someone to fall in love, just to make them suffer  

[Coro]  
Traitor, I don’t care what you want from me  
Liar, you just want me to die of love  
Traitor, in my life you were just a passing phase  
Liar, I don’t care if you die of love  

[Post-Coro]  
Oh, eh, eh, eh, oh, eh, eh, eh  
Liar, I don’t care if you die of love  

[Verso: Cosculluela]  
And betrayal is paid with betrayal, baby  
That doesn’t change anything from here (El Princi)  
It transmits a feeling that incites you  
Girl, accept reality, the truth is to be admitted  
The candles melt, that hiding place  
You and I together again, the story repeats itself in reverse  
I look in the mirror and talk to myself  
There’s no one else like you in this whole universe  
But I’m invincible, still feeling terrible  
And another guy who matches me in this impossible world  
Excuse me, I’m just having fun  
My heart is broken, I was paid back with betrayal (El Princi)  
Excuse me, I’m just having fun (Yatra, Yatra)  
My heart is broken (El Mueka)  
I was paid back with betrayal  

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra]  
Traitor, I don’t care what you want from me  
Liar, you just want me to die of love  
Traitor, in my life you were just a passing phase  
Liar, I don’t care if you die of love  

[Post-Coro: Sebastián Yatra, Cali & El Dandee]  
Oh, eh, eh, eh, oh, eh, eh, eh  
Liar, I don’t care if you die of love (Cali y El Dandee)  

[Verso 2: Cali & El Dandee]  
You enchanted me with how you dance  
You put me under a spell and then you leave alone  
You lent me an illusion, my heart is overwhelmed  
And then you laugh at me  
Why? Why do you treat me like this?  
Why did you come to kill me inside?  
I don’t want to feel what I feel anymore  
You will always be the first, and even though I love you, just go away  

[Coro: Sebastián Yatra, Cali & El Dandee]  
Traitor, I don’t care what you want from me  
Liar, you just want me to die of love  
Traitor, in my life you were just a passing phase  
Liar, I don’t care if you die of love  

[Post-Coro]  
Oh, eh, eh, eh, oh, eh, eh, eh  
Liar, I don’t care if you die of love  

[Outro: Sebastián Yatra, Cosculluela, Cali & El Dandee]  
Sebastián Yatra  
And the Princi  
El Mueka  
Cali & El Dandee, yo  
Cali & El Dandee  
Sebastián Yatra  
Baby  
Yatra, Yatra
