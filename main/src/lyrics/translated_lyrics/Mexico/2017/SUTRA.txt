**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Sebastián Yatra]  
Oh no, no, no  
Yatra, Yatra  

[Verse 1: Sebastián Yatra]  
She goes with me  
But I’m not her friend  
For a long time, I could have been something more  
And even though her heart has a lock  
No one knows, but I have the key  
For a long time, I’ve learned how to make her fall in love  

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra]  
What she likes is for me to sing in her ear at night  
To look at her and say "I love you" once again  
She asks me to give my heart only to her  
I tell her she has me dreaming once again  

What she likes is that (once again, once again)  
She asks me to (once again, once again)  

[Verse 2: Dalmata]  
What she likes is for me to give her ram pam pa pa pam  
Because she says I give her what others don’t  
She says that when I’m around, her sadness disappears  
But when I’m not there, she feels so alone again  
Like Eve in paradise without Adam  
Spending cold nights, days without sun  
Because I’m the one who gives her warmth (brrr) when she’s cold  
And I never fall asleep (I give her affection and love first)  
I pamper her, spoil her, and make her happy  
I tell her "baby, I love you," and she says "I love you, daddy"  
She’s a fan of how I sing, I’m a fan of how she dances  
And she shakes her hips like they’re made of plastic  

[Bridge: Dalmata]  
Oh, wow, she has me hooked  
She makes my heart race with so much love  
Because she’s my superstar, I’m her leading man  
(I’m her leading man)  

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra]  
What she likes is for me to sing in her ear at night  
To look at her and say "I love you" once again  
She asks me to give my heart only to her  
I tell her she has me dreaming once again  

What she likes is that (once again, once again)  
She asks me to (once again, once again)  
Yatra, Yatra  

[Verse 3: Sebastián Yatra]  
She likes how I sing to her  
And I like her face  
And she complains that I’m not a saint  
But still, she calls me  
Because she doesn’t want to be alone  
I won’t leave her alone  
And it scares me to be falling in love  
But you love who you love  

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra]  
What she likes is for me to sing in her ear at night  
To look at her and say "I love you" once again  
She asks me to give my heart only to her  
I tell her she has me dreaming once again  

[Outro: Sebastián Yatra, Dalmata]  
What she likes is that  
Oh, wow, she has me hooked  
Oh, wow, she has me hooked  
Oh, wow, she has me hooked  
Oh, wow (once again, once again)  
(Once again, once again)  
Yatra, Yatra  
(Once again, once again)
