**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Yandel]  
(Eh, eh, eh)  
Ladies and gentlemen, "The Captain" Yandel (Eh, eh)  
CNCO  

[Verse 1: Yandel, Zabdiel De Jesús]  
It's me, the one who can't stop calling you  
Because I haven't been able to forget you  
Since that day I saw you  
It's me, the one who only lives dreaming  
That you’re also falling for me  

[Pre-Chorus: Joel Pimentel]  
And there's something in you that captivates me  
Baby, you drive me crazy, crazy  
I’m enchanted by you, it shows  
And if you and I are already here  

[Chorus: CNCO]  
Hey DJ, play the music you like  
One to make you move and shine  
And dance with me, just with me, hey!  
Hey DJ, play the music you like  
One to make you move and shine  
And dance with me, just with me, hey!  

[Post-Chorus: Christopher Veléz & CNCO]  
And this is how we start falling in love  
And your body is seducing me  
Let the DJ play it again (Hey!)  
To dance with you once more (Hey!)  
And this is how we start falling in love  
And your body is seducing me  
Let the DJ play it again (Hey!)  
To dance with you once agai-ain (Hey!)  

[Verse 2: Yandel]  
(Yandel!)  
She lets herself be felt inside the club  
Hey, DJ, play the song again  
Everyone wants her, but she stays with me  
Dancing until the sun comes up  
Since I saw her, she got into my head  
She’s looking for someone to love her and let the tide take me  
She likes it and doesn’t want me to know  
But your gaze doesn’t deceive me  
And your waist has me on the edge of madness  
DJ, play it again, with this song I found her  

[Chorus: CNCO]  
Hey DJ, play the music you like  
One to make you move and shine  
And dance with me, just with me, hey!  
Hey DJ, play the music you like  
One to make you move and shine  
And dance with me, just with me, hey!  

[Post-Chorus: Christopher Veléz, Yandel & CNCO]  
And this is how we start falling in love  
And your body is seducing me  
Let the DJ play it again (Hey!)  
To dance with you once more (Hey!)  
And this is how we start falling in love  
And your body is seducing me  
Let the DJ play it again (Hey!)  
To dance with you once agai-ain (Hey!)  

[Chorus: CNCO]  
Hey DJ, play the music you like  
One to make you move and shine  
And dance with me, just with me, hey!  
Hey DJ, play the music you like  
One to make you move and shine  
And dance with me, just with me, hey!
