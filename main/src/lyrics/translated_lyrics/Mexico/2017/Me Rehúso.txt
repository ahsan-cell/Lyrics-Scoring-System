**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon girl  
For all those loves that  
Were forced to be apart  
Ba-Ba-Babylon girl, Ba-Ba-Babylon girl  
This song is for you  

[Verse 1]  
Tell me how I explain to my destiny that you’re no longer there  
Tell me how I’ll manage to break free from this frenzy  
This madness I feel for you  
With this chemistry you create in me  
And I can’t anymore, girl, I can’t anymore, girl  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Baby, forgive me if I gave you hope, I didn’t mean to (Oh-uh)  
I know that in love when it’s real, it comes back, comes back (Comes back, comes back)  
But how can I forget your skin?  
And how can I forget you, woman? (Uh-uh-uh)  
I can’t anymore, girl, I can’t anymore, girl  

[Chorus]  
Baby, no (Baby, no)  
I refuse to give you a last kiss, so keep it (Keep it)  
So that next time I can give it to you while doing it (While doing it)  
Doing it like this, this, this  
Just the way you like it, baby  

[Verse 2]  
Without looking back, without seeking anyone else  
I just want to be with you, woah (Woah)  
If I don’t have you here with me, I don’t want to be your friend  
Because you are my path, woah  
And I just want to be by your side  
Baby, please understand  
Just give me your hand and trust me  
If you get lost, just follow my voice  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And give it time (Time), mommy, time (Time)  
That you, that I  
We are meant to be together  
And give it time (Give it time), baby, time  
That you and I, that you and I  
We are meant to be together  

[Chorus]  
Baby, no (Baby, no)  
I refuse to give you a last kiss, so keep it (Keep it)  
So that next time I can give it to you while doing it (While doing it)  
Doing it like this, this, this (This, this)  
Just the way you like it, baby (Woah, woah)  
Baby, no  
I refuse to give you a last kiss, so keep it (Keep it)  
So that next time I can give it to you while doing it  
Doing it like this, this, this  
Just the way you like it, baby  

[Bridge]  
Like this, like this  
Just the way you like it, baby  

[Instrumental Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Baby, no (Baby, no)  
I refuse to give you a last kiss, so keep it (Keep it)  
So that next time I can give it to you while doing it (Uh-uh)  
Doing it like this, this, this (Uh-uh-uh)  
Just the way you like it, baby  
And baby, no (Baby, no)  
I refuse to give you a last kiss, so keep it (Keep it)  
So that next time I can give it to you while doing it  
Doing it like this, this  
Just the way you like it, baby
