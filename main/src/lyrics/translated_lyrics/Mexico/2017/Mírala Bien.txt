**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Yandel]**  
Look at her closely (Eh-eh)  
She’s the one who shakes the ground  
And she doesn’t care with whom (Eh-eh)  
You let her hair down  
And you pull it too (Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh; hard)  
But look at her closely (But look at her closely)  
But look at her closely (But look at her closely)  
She’s the one who shakes the ground  
And she doesn’t care with whom  

**[Post-Chorus: Yandel & Wisin]**  
Dancing, with whom?  
Flirting, with whom?  
Grooving, with whom? (Hey, my friend, if I were you; hah)  

**[Verse 1: Wisin]**  
Look at her closely, that girl hypnotizes you (Hah)  
She enchants you (Hah), when she hits the club (Buh)  
Her pants match her shirt (Hah)  
Fake nails (Buh), and her hair is curled  
Sometimes she wants me to kiss her (How?)  
That’s when Wisin shines  
I’ve been going hard for 6 months  
Tell her, Yandel knows what drives her crazy  

**[Refrain: Yandel]**  
Let them touch her  
Let them kiss her  
Let them grind on her  
She won’t care  
Let them touch her  
Let them kiss her  
Let them grind on her  
She’ll easily walk away  

**[Chorus: Yandel]**  
Look at her closely (Eh-eh)  
She’s the one who shakes the ground  
And she doesn’t care with whom (Eh-eh)  
You let her hair down  
And you pull it too (Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)  
But look at her closely (But look at her closely)  
But look at her closely (But look at her closely)  
She’s the one who shakes the ground  
And she doesn’t care with whom  

**[Post-Chorus: Yandel & Wisin]**  
Dancing, with whom?  
Flirting, with whom?  
Grooving, with whom? (Hey, my friend)  

**[Verse 2: Wisin]**  
That girl is a treasure, I adore her  
Her boyfriend messed up and turned into a bull  
Sevú, she’s with W  
I do what you never did, buh (Wah-yah!)  
Like a karate master  
The old fox who could be your match  
Baby, I’m going far, I never leave her (Hah)  
Save her skin  

**[Refrain: Yandel]**  
Let them touch her  
Let them kiss her  
Let them grind on her  
She won’t care  
Let them touch her  
Let them kiss her  
Let them grind on her  
She’ll easily walk away  

**[Outro: Wisin]**  
Let them touch her  
Let them kiss her  
Let them grind on her  
She doesn’t care what they do to her  
She just wants to quench her thirst, hahahaha  
W with Yandel  
"The duo of history," brocky  
Don’t play around, you’re making a fool of yourself  
Did you hear?  
Buh  
Cayey  
Agustín, tell him  
Berto, tell them who we are  
There’s no league, no break  
At the top are those who are there  
Don’t kid yourself, papi, you’re not climbing higher than that
