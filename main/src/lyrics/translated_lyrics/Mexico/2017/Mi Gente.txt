**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: J Balvin]  
If the rhythm makes you move your head  
We’re starting just like that  
My music doesn’t discriminate against anyone  
So let’s break it down  
All my people are moving  
Look at how the rhythm has them  
I make music that entertains  
The world wants us, wants us  
It wants me  
All my people are moving  
Look at how the rhythm has them  
I make music that entertains  
My music has them dancing hard  
And this is how we dance  

[Chorus: Instrumental]  

[Verse 2: Willy William]  
We’re breaking the club  
The party doesn’t stop, it’s just beginning  
It’s like this, it’s like that  
My darling, la-la-la-la-la  
France, Colombia  
I like it (Freeze)  
J Balvin, Willy William  
They like it (Freeze)  
The DJs don’t lie, my people love it  
And it went global (Freeze)  
We don’t slow down, we never stop  
It’s another hit and bam!  

[Pre-Chorus: J Balvin, Willy William]  
And where are my people?  
But move your head  
And where are my people?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah  
One, two, three, let’s go!  
(Ay, say yes)  

[Chorus: Instrumental]  

[Verse 3: J Balvin]  
Corner to corner, we’re not leaving here  
The world is big, but I have it in my hands  
I’m really good, yes, okay, here we go  
And with time, we keep rising  
We’re still breaking it down here  
This party has no end  
Bottles up, yes  
I have them dancing, breaking it down, and I’m still here  
We’re still breaking it down here  
This party has no end  
Bottles up, yes  
I have them dancing, breaking it down  

[Pre-Chorus: J Balvin, Willy William]  
And where are my people?  
But move your head  
And where are my people?  
Say yeah, yeah, yeah  
One, two, three, let’s go!  
(Ay, say yes)  

[Chorus: Instrumental]  

[Outro: J Balvin]  
Worldwide  
Willy William  
J Balvin, man  
Uh-huh  
Uh-huh  
Uh-huh  
Uh-huh
