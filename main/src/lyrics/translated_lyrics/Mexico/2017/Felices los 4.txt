**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Maluma, baby

[Verse 1]  
As soon as the sun rises, you run away  
I know you’ll think this is hurting me  
I’m not thinking about what you’re doing  
If we’re strangers and this is how we love (Mm-mm-mm)

[Pre-Chorus]  
If you stay with me  
Or if you go with someone else  
I don’t care at all because I know you’ll come back  
If you stay with me  
Or if you go with someone else  
I don’t care at all because I know you’ll come back

[Chorus]  
And if you spend time with another  
Let’s be happy, let’s be happy, the four of us happy  
We’ll make the room bigger  
And if you spend time with another  
Let’s be happy, let’s be happy, the four of us happy  
I accept your deal

[Post-Chorus]  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time (Alright, alright, baby)

[Verse 2]  
And we’ll do it another time  
What we have doesn’t depend on a pact  
Enjoy and just feel the impact  
The boom boom that burns you, that mermaid body  
Don’t worry, I don’t believe in contracts (And neither do you)

[Refrain]  
And whenever she leaves, she comes back to me (And the four of us happy)  
It doesn’t matter what they say, we like it this way (We’ll make the room bigger, baby)  
And whenever she leaves, she comes back to me (And the four of us happy)  
It doesn’t matter what they say  
We’re made for each other

[Chorus]  
And if you spend time with another  
Let’s be happy, let’s be happy, the four of us happy  
We’ll make the room bigger  
And if you spend time with another  
Let’s be happy, let’s be happy, the four of us happy  
I accept your deal

[Post-Chorus]  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time

[Pre-Chorus]  
If you stay with me  
Or if you go with someone else  
I don’t care at all because I know you’ll come back  
If you stay with me  
Or if you go with someone else  
I don’t care at all because I know you’ll come back

[Chorus]  
And if you spend time with another  
Let’s be happy, let’s be happy, the four of us happy  
We’ll make the room bigger  
And if you spend time with another  
Let’s be happy, let’s be happy, the four of us happy  
I accept your deal

[Post-Chorus]  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time  
And we’ll do it another time
