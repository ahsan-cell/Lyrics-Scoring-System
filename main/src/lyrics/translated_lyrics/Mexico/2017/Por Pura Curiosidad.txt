**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Because of that mouth I want to bite  
I can't sleep, I can't sleep  
Because of your eyes and your curves, woman  
I'm lovesick, I don't know what to do  

[Pre-Chorus]  
That black dress you wear  
Has me analyzing you from north to south  
I'm driving down the road, following your hips  
All through the night  

[Chorus]  
Out of pure curiosity, when the lights went out  
I leaned in to give you a kiss, and you liked it  
Out of pure curiosity, that's how it happened  
And here I am looking for a place for two  

[Post-Chorus]  
With this downpour  
Let the rain fall, I'm burning up  
With this downpour  
Let the rain fall, my darling  

[Verse 2]  
I was feeling bored  
And now with you, everything's fun  
I no longer ask what day it is  
I don't even look at the clock  

[Pre-Chorus]  
That black dress you wear  
Has me analyzing you from north to south  
I'm driving down the road, following your hips  
All through the night  

The way you dance drives me wild  
With that movement and that attitude  
It makes me restless, it makes me restless  

[Chorus]  
Out of pure curiosity, when the lights went out  
I leaned in to give you a kiss, and you liked it  
Out of pure curiosity, that's how it happened  
And here I am looking for a place for two  

[Post-Chorus]  
With this downpour  
Let the rain fall, I'm burning up  
With this downpour  
Let the rain fall, my darling  

[Chorus]  
Out of pure curiosity, when the lights went out  
I leaned in to give you a kiss, and you liked it  
Out of pure curiosity, that's how it happened  
And here I am looking for a place for two  

[Post-Chorus]  
With this downpour (I was feeling bored)  
With this downpour (And now with you, everything's fun)  
With this downpour  
Let the rain fall, my darling
