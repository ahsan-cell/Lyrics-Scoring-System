**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Five in the morning, you call me (whoo!)  
Just to see who's in my bed (nah!)  
I don't have time for your drama  
Don't call me at five in the morning  

[Verse 1]  
Because for sure I'm out partying with my sister  
You want to call me only when you feel like it (when you feel like it)  
I want to dance tonight  
I'm going to enjoy myself without regrets  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You get jealous if you see me with someone else  
I do what I want, I just enjoy myself  
You get jealous if I dance with another  
I'm not one of them, and neither are you  

[Chorus]  
I know you're jealous and I see you  
And you look at me, I move my body (hey)  
You get jealous if I dance with another  
I do what I want, I just enjoy myself  
You might also like  
I make it go rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom (I make it)  
You want rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom  
I make it go rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom (I make it)  
You want rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom  
(You want rom-pom-pom-pom)  

[Verse 2]  
I don't need you to pay for my drinks  
You're intense, you're doing too much  
You have money but I work too (I work)  
I don't ask if I want it, I just do it  
I know you want to feel my skin  
I'm not that type, you know it well  
I've told you more than once (once)  
That I'm not going to fall  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You get jealous if you see me with someone else  
I do what I want, I just enjoy myself  
You get jealous if I dance with another  
I'm not one of them, and neither are you  

[Chorus]  
I know you're jealous and I see you (I know you're jealous; and I see you)  
And you look at me, I move my body (and you look at me; hey)  
You get jealous if I dance with another (oh, oh)  
I do what I want, I just enjoy myself  

[Bridge]  
(Pay for my drinks  
I feel too much  
I work too  
I don't ask if I want it, I just do it)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You get jealous if you see me with someone else  
I do what I want, I just enjoy myself  
You get jealous if I dance with another  
I'm not one of them, and neither are you  

[Chorus]  
I know you're jealous and I see you (I know you're jealous; and I see you)  
And you look at me, I move my body (and you look at me; hey)  
You get jealous if I dance with another (oh, oh)  
I do what I want, I just enjoy myself  

I make it go rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom (I make it)  
You want rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom  
(I know what you want)  
I make it go rom-pom-pom, pom-pom-pom-pom (I make it)  
(You want rom-pom-pom-pom)  

[Outro]  
Five in the morning, you call me  
Just to see who's in my bed  
I don't have time for your drama  
Don't call me at five in the morning
