**[Intro]**  
O-O-Ovy On The Drums  

**[Verse 1]**  
Come closer, leave the doubt behind  
The night is cold, but with me, you’ll be fine  
Detach yourself from bitterness  
And let me take you to your rightful height  
From your craziness, from your ideas  
From your culture and your science  
Will I reach it? I don’t know, but tonight—  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You can’t escape me  
Tonight, I won’t hold back my words  
I’ve always dreamed of having this evening  
And there’s something I need to tell you  
You can’t escape me  
Tonight, I won’t hold back my words  
I’ve always dreamed of having this evening  
And there’s something I need to tell you  

**[Chorus]**  
Like Adam and Eve, let’s have our sin  
Like two thieves: a well-kept secret  
A path and a secured destiny  
Where these fugitives are loved  
And like Adam and Eve, let’s have our sin  
Like two thieves: a well-kept secret  
A path and a secured destiny  
Where these fugitives are loved (Hey)  

**[Verse 2]**  
You live with someone else, and I’m half alone  
They don’t want me, he doesn’t value you  
He doesn’t greet you or say "Hello"  
And no one talks to me at any hour  
You live on one corner, and I live on the other  
And I watch you all day, waiting for the right moment  
To get closer; I want to feel you, I want to see you, babe  
To talk to you; I want to tell you, I want to explain, babe  
That I’m not someone interesting, just another coward  
Who did enough to get close today, babe, babe  
I can’t take it anymore, you have to listen  
To what I came to offer, hey  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You can’t escape me (No)  
Tonight, I won’t hold back my words (Yeah)  
I’ve always dreamed of having this evening  
And there’s something I need to tell you (Wuh!)  

**[Chorus]**  
Like Adam and Eve, let’s have our sin  
Like two thieves: a well-kept secret  
A path and a secured destiny (Woh-oh, yeah-eh)  
Where these fugitives are loved  
And like Adam and Eve, let’s have our sin (Woh)  
Like two thieves: a well-kept secret (Yeah)  
A path and a secured destiny (Woh-oh, yeah-eh)  
Where these fugitives are loved  

**[Bridge]**  
Like Adam and Eve (Hey)  
Like Adam and Eve (Ah)  
Like Adam and Eve  
Like Adam and Eve  

**[Verse 1]**  
A-A-A-A-A-Come closer, leave the doubt behind  
The night is cold, but with me, you’ll be fine  
Detach yourself from bitterness  
And let me take you to your rightful height  
From your craziness, from your ideas  
From your culture and your science  
Will I reach it? I don’t know, but tonight—  

**[Interlude]**  
Ah…  
I know I’m quite annoying, but I want to tell you that...  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You can’t escape me (No)  
Tonight, I won’t hold back my words (Yeah)  
I’ve always dreamed of having this evening (-la, -la, -la, -la, -la)  
And there’s something I need to tell you (Wuh!)  
That you can’t escape me (No)  
Tonight, I won’t hold back my words (Yeah)  
I’ve always dreamed of having this evening (Woh-oh, yeah-eh)  
And there’s something I need to tell you (Yeah)  

**[Outro]**  
¡Shiuf!  
Ovy On The Drums, On The Drums, On The Drums (Woh)  
Paulo Londra, hey (Yeah)  
Big Leagues  
The Mayors, ah  
The Kristoman, hey (Woh)  
Leones Con Flow (Yeah)  
Oh, oh; oh, oh (Woh-oh; yeah-eh)  
Yeah-eh-eh (Yeah-eh)  
Like Adam and Eve, hey (Simple; yeah-eh-eh)  
Like Adam and Eve, ah (Yeah-eh-eh)  
Like Adam and Eve  
Like Adam and Eve (Yeah-eh-eh)
