**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Juan]  
I can't stand another second without seeing you  
Answer me now, this is life or death  
You know me well, I’ve never been this strong  

[Pre-Chorus: David]  
You left our love in the past  
This relationship hanging in suspense  
Tell me if it was worth it  
Tell me if it was worth it  

[Chorus: Juan, David]  
More than a thousand years will pass and I won't forget you  
Don't ask me for it, I won't be your friend  
Being with you is my destiny  

More than a thousand years will pass and I won't forget you  
Don't ask me for it, I won't be your friend  
I won't accept the suspense  

Come on  

[Verse 2: Pablo]  
Giving you so much was my weakness  
And your kisses are now my need  
Now only loneliness keeps me company  
With you, I feel like I'm losing my dignity, yeah  
I’m yours, even if I don’t have you, I feel like I’m yours  
And still, I keep asking myself  
If I wasn’t enough for you (for you)  
I wasn’t enough for you  

I’m yours, even if I don’t have you, I feel like I’m yours  
And still, I keep asking myself  
If I wasn’t enough for you, uuuuh  

[Chorus: Juan, David]  
More than a thousand years will pass and I won't forget you  
Don't ask me for it, I won't be your friend  
Being with you is my destiny  

More than a thousand years will pass and I won't forget you  
Don't ask me for it, I won't be your friend  
I won't accept the suspense  

[Bridge: Juan]  
You left our love in the past  
Our relationship hanging in suspense  
Tell me if it was worth it, tell me if it was worth it (come on, come on)  
I can't stand another second without seeing you  
Answer me now, this is life or death  
You know me well, I’ve never been this strong, ah  

[Chorus: Juan, David]  
More than a thousand years will pass and I won't forget you  
Don't ask me for it, I won't be your friend  
Being with you is my destiny  

More than a thousand years will pass and I won't forget you  
Don't ask me for it, I won't be your friend  
I won't accept the suspense  

[Outro: Juan]  
Come on, come on  
Come on, come on
