**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
-Now  
Are we breaking it down or not, guys? (Uh)  
And if the people ask  
J Balvin, man  
And if the people ask  
Let’s go, let’s go  

[Chorus]  
And if the people ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
I won’t deny it (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
If the women ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
Then I’m gonna give it to them (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
And if the people ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
I won’t deny it (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
If the women ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
Then I’m gonna give it to them (Reggaeton, reggaeton; hey)  
(She asks, she asks; let’s go)  

[Verse 1]  
DJ, play it, speed it up  
Everyone down low and without fear, shake that booty  
Don’t kill my vibe right now, just enjoy it  
Add some flavor, baby, like Tego says (El Abayarde)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You already know who they are  
I stand out from the crowd  
God bless reggaeton, amen  
Down low, that’s how I am  
Yankee inspires me for this  
I drop hard like rum  
Skirt with my pants, dancing reggaeton  

[Chorus]  
(Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
I won’t deny it (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
If the women ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
Then I’m gonna give it to them (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
And if the people ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
I won’t deny it (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
If the women ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
Then I’m gonna give it to them (Reggaeton, reggaeton; hey)  

[Verse 2]  
Reggaeton makes it freaky  
It sticks like Kiki  
Like Yaviah with the "Wiki Wiki" (Sou!)  
Living life crazy like Ricky  
Don’t be picky  
'Cause I’ve seen you smoking krippy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You already know who they are  
I stand out from the crowd  
God bless reggaeton, amen (Amen)  
Down low, that’s how I am  
Yankee inspires me for this  
I drop hard like rum (Rum, rum; Hey)  

[Chorus]  
And if the people ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
I won’t deny it (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
If the women ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
Then I’m gonna give it to them (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
And if the people ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
I won’t deny it (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
If the women ask (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  
Then I’m gonna give it to them (Reggaeton, reggaeton)  

[Outro]  
The business, partner  
(J Balvin, man) J Balvin, man  
Sky breaking it down (Sky)  
Tainy (Tainy)  
Did you see?, did you see?
