**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]  
Strangers  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yes, yes  

[Pre-Chorus: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]  
We’re just two strangers  
Eager to kiss  
Eager for whatever happens to happen  
We’re just two (We’re just two)  
Strangers  
Afraid of falling in love  
Afraid of whatever happens to happen  

[Chorus: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo]  
Let’s have a good time  
If you want, we can fall in love later  
Let’s have a good time  
Step by step, so we don’t mess it up  
Let’s have a good time (Yeah)  
If you want, we can fall in love later  
Let’s have a good time  
Step by step, so we don’t mess it up  

[Verse 1: Camilo]  
Hey, hey, listen to me well  
You’re exactly what I’m looking for in a woman  
I’ve had my eye on you since I arrived  
I feel like you’re mine, I don’t know why  
Oh, I know it’s a lie  
To say I’m the man of your life  
When yesterday you didn’t know me  
And didn’t know that you wanted me  

[Chorus: Camilo, Mau y Ricky]  
Let’s have a good time  
And if you want, we can fall in love later  
Let’s have a good time  
Step by step, so we don’t mess it up  
Let’s have a good time (For a while)  
If you want, we can fall in love later (Fall in love later)  
Let’s have a good time  
Step by step, so we don’t mess it up  
And let’s dance slowly  

[Verse 2: Manuel Turizo]  
I don’t know how to explain what I see in you  
I love how you’re moving  
Your body against my body, babe  
I don’t understand it  
Tell me if you were hiding from me  
You so beautiful and I’m just getting to know you  
Let’s dance without caring who’s watching  
Today I want to have you with me, with me  
I want to enjoy myself with you, with you  
Today I want to have you with me, with me  
And watch the sunrise with you, with you  

[Pre-Chorus: Mau y Ricky, Camilo, Mau y Ricky & Manuel Turizo]  
We’re just two strangers  
Eager to kiss (Afraid of falling in love)  
Eager for whatever happens to happen  
We’re just two  
Strangers (Two strangers)  
Afraid of falling in love (Eager to kiss)  
Afraid of whatever happens to happen  

[Chorus: Mau y Ricky, Manuel Turizo & Camilo]  
Let’s have a good time  
If you want, we can fall in love later (Oh)  
Let’s have a good time  
Step by step, so we don’t mess it up  
Oh, let’s have a good time (Yeah)  
And if you want, we can fall in love later  
Let’s have a good time  
Step by step, so we don’t mess it up  

[Outro]  
(Mau y Ricky)
