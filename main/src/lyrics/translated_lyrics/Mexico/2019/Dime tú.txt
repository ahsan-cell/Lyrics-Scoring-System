**[Intro]**  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, oh  

**[Chorus]**  
I've crowned myself king of your lips  
This crazy skill that’s taught me to live, eh, eh  
Torn inside, shouting to the winds for you  
I've prepared for this moment, uh-wouh  
And to conquer that breath forever, yeih  
I’ll act like a time that has kept you for me  

**[Refrain]**  
And tell me,  
Tell me who you will kiss, woh  
When the sun falls from the sky  
And glides through your hair, baby, tell me  
And tell me, tell me who you will kiss  
I choose you  

**[Bridge]**  
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay  
Because I, because I, because I...  

**[Verse 1]**  
Let your body (Uh, oh) reveal little by little  
That little move that doesn’t (Oh, no) let my mind rest  
And don’t tell me no (No, no), I see it in your eyes  
Those desires that I, oh, that I provoke in you  

**[Chorus]**  
And
