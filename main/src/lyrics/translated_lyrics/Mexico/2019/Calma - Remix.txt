**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Pedro Capó & Farruko]  
Laramercy gang  
Welcome to paradise  
¡Farru!  
Four hugs and a coffee  
I just woke up  
And looking at you, I remembered  
That I've found everything  
Your hand in my hand  
We escaped from it all  
Together watching the sun set  
(Let them enjoy the paradise)

[Chorus: Pedro Capó]  
Let’s go to the beach, to heal your soul  
Close the screen, open a Medalla (a local beer)  
All the Caribbean Sea, watching your waist  
You flirt, you’re a party seeker, and I like it

[Post-Chorus: Pedro Capó]  
Slow and happy, facing the wind  
Slow and happy, facing the wind

[Verse 1: Farruko]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ¡Farru!  
And take advantage that the sun is hot, let’s enjoy the vibe  
Let’s dive into the water so you can feel how good it is  
And let’s go tropical, along the coast to bar hop  
From bar to bar, we stop for a cold Medalla  
To quench our thirst  
A little Bob Marley and some sangria  
So you can loosen up, little by little  
Because to have fun, you don’t need to leave Puerto Rico  
And go slow, take a shot of Coquito (a coconut drink)  
And as Fonsi says, let’s do it slowly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
So you can loosen up, little by little  
Because to have fun, you don’t need to leave Puerto Rico (Laramercy gang)

[Chorus: Pedro Capó & Farruko]  
Let’s go to the beach, to heal your soul  
Close the screen, open a Medalla  
All the Caribbean Sea, watching your waist  
You flirt, you’re a party seeker  
Let’s go to the beach, to heal your soul  
Close the screen, open a Medalla  
All the Caribbean Sea, watching your waist  
You flirt, baby, you’re stunning and I like it

[Post-Chorus: Pedro Capó & Farruko]  
Slow and happy, facing the wind  
Slow and happy, facing the wind

[Verse 2: Farruko]  
Farru, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
And go slow, hit it hard  
I put on reggaeton so you can turn off that body  
Go all the way down, that move is fire  
The only witness we have here is the wind  
And go, move your waist, kill me with your beauty  
Look how she shows off because she knows she’s stunning

[Bridge: Pedro Capó & Farruko]  
Calm down, my love, take it easy  
Nothing is needed  
If we’re together walking  
Calm down, my love, take it easy  
Nothing is needed  
If we’re dancing together

[Chorus: Pedro Capó & Farruko]  
Let’s go to the beach, to heal your soul  
Close the screen, open a Medalla  
All the Caribbean Sea, watching your waist  
You flirt, you’re a party seeker  
Let’s go to the beach, to heal your soul  
Close the screen, open a Medalla  
All the Caribbean Sea, watching your waist  
You flirt, baby, you’re stunning and I like it
