**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Yandel & Wisin]  
Wisin and Yandel!  
Back with the King  

[Verse 1: Romeo Santos, Wisin & Yandel]  
I found one of your hairs on my bed  
I kept thinking about where you are now  
I was waiting for you a couple of hours ago  
(Almost always everything comes to light; For hours)  
I have a feeling that you’re not alone  
You haven’t even sent me a "Hello"  
You keep wrapping me up  

[Pre-Chorus: Yandel]  
With the same story  
When I see you, I forget everything  
I don’t want to talk, I’d rather play it cool  
Taking off your clothes little by little  

[Chorus: Romeo Santos & Yandel]  
Howling like a she-wolf (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
Who could possibly not forgive you?  
If my bed misses you?  
Anyone would fall in love (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
If they spend a night with you  
And you do what you do with me (Yandel!)  

[Verse 2: Yandel]  
Explain to me, if you’re with me and you’re with him (Him)  
Then I’ll find another girl too (Oh, oh, uh-uh-uh)  
And we’ll just have a good time, decide already  
Because I know you like how I do it (Eh-eh, eh)  
Who are you fooling? Don’t say no (Eh-eh)  
For some reason, we always end up both eating each other, baby  

[Bridge: Romeo Santos]  
What luck I have with my bad memory  
I only remember the glory  
Of when we make love  

[Pre-Chorus: Yandel & Wisin]  
With the same story  
When I see you, I forget everything  
I don’t want to talk, I’d rather play it cool  
Taking off your clothes little by little (Yeah!)  

[Chorus: Romeo Santos, Yandel & Wisin]  
Howling like a she-wolf (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
Who could possibly not forgive you?  
If my bed misses you  
Anyone would fall in love (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
If they spend a night with you  
And you do what you do with me  
(Baby, you won’t catch me as a fool again; W!)  

[Verse 3: Wisin]  
Baby, I was waiting for you, and you’re rolling around in another bed  
Knowing that with him you feel nothing at all  
I’m the one who takes you to the clouds (Yeah), the one who lifts you up (Yeah)  
The one who warms you with kisses and you flow quickly (Light it up!)  
I’m the man who presses you against the wall (Pah, pah, tra)  
The one who relieves your stress  
You tremble when you see me (What?)  
It’s that I already know what’s going on, why do you disguise it?  
Tell that fool how I did it on the terrace  
And I reveal (Hard!), I put a blindfold over your eyes (Tra, tra, tra)  
You had velvet lingerie (Hard!)  
I still find your hair on my sheets  
I know you can’t get over it when I bite your neck ("The King")  

[Verse 4: Romeo Santos, Yandel & Wisin]  
If he knew that you divide us on the calendar  
A she-wolf without an owner has no schedule  
You’ve become a necessary evil  
And he believes your story  
Whatever you tell him, he believes it like a child (Uh-huh)  
And I enjoy your skin, living in the moment  

[Chorus: Yandel & Wisin]  
Howling like a she-wolf (Yandel!; auh, uh-uh, uh-uh; yeah!)  
Who could possibly not forgive you?  
If my bed misses you  
Anyone would fall in love (Auh, uh-uh, uh-uh)  
If they spend a night with you  
And you do what you do with me  

[Outro: Romeo Santos, Wisin & Yandel]  
Howling like a she-wolf  
Surely at this moment you’re wondering how they do it  
Ladies and gentlemen, it’s the Champions League  
W, Yandel  
The King, Romeo  
Anyone would fall in love  
Chris Jeday  
Gaby Music (Eh-eh)  
The Champions of the People  
W with Yandel (Eh, eh, eh)  
Hahaha
