**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I don't need you to give me explanations  
If I already know the reasons  
I've lost so much in matters of love  
That it doesn't surprise me to lose again  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Cursed luck  
Loving who you shouldn't  
The mind is strong  
But the heart doesn't understand  

[Chorus]  
Nothing new  
Giving it all and losing in the attempt  
Always being left at the worst moment  
For me, that's already normal, I know how it will end  
Nothing new  
Resigning myself to say goodbye and start from scratch  
Condemned to keep living in memories  
If they tell you I'm not well, don't be alarmed  
Because for me, it's nothing new  

[Instrumental Interlude]  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Cursed luck  
Loving who you shouldn't  
The mind is strong  
But the heart doesn't understand  

[Chorus]  
Nothing new  
Giving it all and losing in the attempt  
Always being left at the worst moment  
For me, that's already normal, I know how it will end  
Nothing new  
Resigning myself to say goodbye and start from scratch  
Condemned to keep living in memories  
If they tell you I'm not well, don't be alarmed  
Because for me, it's nothing new
