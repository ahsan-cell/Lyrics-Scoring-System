**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Prince Royce]  
(Oh-oh, yeah; oh-oh, uh, uh; yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Prince Royce & Anuel AA]  
From the moment I saw you, I knew you were for me  
Now look at you here, your heart beats for me (For me)  
But I didn’t know how to value you, baby, I did you wrong  
You have me here, talking to myself in the mirror (-ror)  
Wondering why I feel you so far away (Far away)  
Look at what was built from a simple desire  
But if everything died for you...  
(Anuel)

[Chorus: Anuel AA & Prince Royce]  
Let me in like before (Eh)  
When you and I were lovers (Uah, uah)  
Baby, I’m not here to miss you (Oh-oh-oh)  
This has taken an interesting turn  
Let me in like before  
When you and I were lovers  
Baby, I’m not here to miss you  
This has taken an interesting turn

[Verse 1: Anuel AA & Prince Royce]  
My bubalú  
I miss biting you all over and your blue hair (Blue)  
I spend time alone in the Ferrari thinking of you while the engine's in the trunk  
Come back (Come back)  
Without you, even the angels cry  
That’s why the clouds rain  
Sometimes you don’t know what you have until you lose it  
You even killed Cupid (-pido)  
There were so many promises that I haven’t kept (Haven’t kept)  
Baby, I miss your moans and I won’t stop your happiness  
But you’ve already made your life and I hate your husband (Brr)  
And I wish times were like before (Before)  
But like Ozuna, I was a fake, eh  
And I failed you and disappointed you (Eh), uah  
And I spread the love between us

[Chorus: Prince Royce, Anuel AA & Becky G]  
Let me in like before  
When you and I were lovers  
Baby, I’m not here to miss you  
This has taken an interesting turn  
Let me in like before  
When you and I were lovers (Uah)  
Baby, I’m not here to miss you (Oh-oh-oh; yeah)  
This has taken an interesting turn

[Verse 2: Becky G & Prince Royce]  
I’m the same as always, she’s just a trend (Trend)  
Tell her I’m the one who can steal you if she wants (Steal)  
When you touch her, baby, you think of me  
Dare to deny it  
Let’s do it like before (Yah)  
I’ll wait for you in my room  
I want you to make me lose control  
Obviously, without seeking love (Woah)  
A carnal desire, even if the heart doesn’t approve  
And I lie if I say I don’t think  
About our first encounter  
Everything that led to just one kiss  
How to forget that it ended body to body?

[Chorus: Prince Royce & Becky G]  
Let me in like before  
When you and I were lovers  
Baby, I’m not here to miss you (No-no)  
This has taken an interesting turn  
You want to love me like before (Yeah)  
When you and I were lovers  
Baby, I’m not here to miss you  
This has taken an interesting turn (¡Ska'!)

[Outro: Anuel AA, Becky G & Prince Royce]  
Hear This Music, did you hear, baby?  
Uah, uah (Yeah, yeah)  
Hey, tell me, Luian  
The Untouchables, the Illuminati  
Luian  
Hey, tell me, Mambo Kingz  
The kings with the gods, did you hear, baby?  
(Mambo Kingz)  
¡Brr!  
Anuel  
Hey, tell me, Prince Royce  
The Illuminati  
Royce  
(Real until death, did you hear, baby?)  
Becky-Becky-Becky G  
Hey, tell me, Hydro (Hydro)  
Hey, tell me, Jowny (Jowny)  
Hear This Music  
¡Brr!
