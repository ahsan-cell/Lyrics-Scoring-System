**Translated Lyrics:**

Because loving you has brought me trouble  
Through the glass, I can still see your face  
The desire to see you doesn’t fade away  

I’m in such a hurry to go find you  
Then I regret it, anger takes over me  
It was the biggest disappointment I’ve ever had  
What you did to me is the worst I’ve lived through  

Tell me, bartender, you know about heartaches  
How many drinks will it take to forget her?  
She traded me for some coins  
Now she wants to come back, better if she doesn’t return  

Because I don’t want to know about her life anymore  
Remembering her kisses only hurts me  
Through the glass, I still see her  
Because like a fool, I still love her  
I still love her  

Tell me, bartender, you know about heartaches  
How many drinks will it take to forget her?  
She traded me for some coins  
Now she wants to come back, better if she doesn’t return  

Because I don’t want to know about her life anymore  
Remembering her kisses only hurts me  
Through the glass, I still see her  
Because like a fool, I still love her  
I still love her
