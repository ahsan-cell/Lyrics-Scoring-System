**[Intro: Paulo Londra & Becky G]**  
And when I saw you, I knew you weren't meant for me (Paulo)  
You probably had someone you weren't going to let go (Becky G), hey  
But when I saw you, I swear I made up my mind  
To get closer and tell you that  

**[Chorus: Becky G, Paulo Londra & Both]**  
When I kissed you, yeah  
I felt like I touched the sky, woah, oh-oh  
And I wasn't wrong, no-no-no, no-no-no (Ah, ah)  
Because I would do it again, oh, again, oh, again  
And when I kissed you, yeah, eh, eh  
I felt like I touched the sky, woah, oh  
And I wasn't wrong, no-no-no, no-no-no  
Because I would do it again, again, and again  
Yeah, yeah-yeah  

**[Verse 1: Becky G]**  
It all started walking down the street  
You squeezed my hand, yeah, eh-eh (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I felt that something special, that something I talked so much about (Something special)  
And I didn't think it would happen  
It all ended in a kiss, and kissing you was a pleasure (Yeah, eh, eh)  
I just wanted to get to know you, I liked you  
I don't know why I always want to kiss you  
Maybe, perhaps, I was born to love you (I was born to love you)  
I was born to love you  
I want to kiss you again, because (Yeah)  

**[Chorus: Paulo Londra, Becky G & Both]**  
When I kissed you, yeah, eh  
I felt like I touched the sky, oh-oh  
And I wasn't wrong, no-no-no, no-no-no  
Because I would do it again, again, and again  
And when I kissed you, yeah, eh  
I felt like I touched the sky, woah, oh, oh (Oh)  
And I wasn't wrong, no-no-no, no-no-no  
Because I would do it again, oh, again, oh, again, yeah  
(Leone' with Flow, wuh; yeah)  

**[Verse 2: Paulo Londra]**  
Forever alone but then I saw you  
And the world changed, I don't think about anything else (Oh!)  
I feel an emotion and dancing with you  
Is the only thing that matters to me now (Wuh!)  
Come with me, leave the fear (What?, hey)  
Just a moment to dance (Yeah)  
Oh my God, what talent, those moves drive me crazy  
Just a little longer, I ask you please (Yeah)  
Don't go, my hope will fade (Oh!)  
You're the only one who can calm my heart, yeah, eh (Wuh!)  
You know well that I'm only focused on you (Only on you)  
And that I can't forget—  

**[Chorus: Becky G, Paulo Londra & Both]**  
When I kissed you, yeah, eh  
I felt like I touched the sky, woah, oh-oh (No-no-no-no-no-no-no-no)  
And I wasn't wrong, no-no-no, no-no-no (No; no)  
Because I would do it again, and again, and again (Again, -o-o)  
And when I kissed you, yeah, eh, eh (Eh)  
I felt like I touched the sky, woah, oh  
And I wasn't wrong, no-no-no, no-no-no (No-no-no)  
Because I would do it again, and again, and again  
Yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
