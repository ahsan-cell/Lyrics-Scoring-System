**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Sky  
Na, na, na  
No need to talk, we already feel the connection (Connection)  
When you arrived, you caught all the attention (Ouh, oh-uoh)  
The night will last forever if we give her what she wants  
This is how I wanted to see you, dancing with me, moving in your own way  

[Chorus]  
She says she dances alone, talks about not being controlled  
With me, she ignores all that, dancing, the hours slip away  
She says she dances alone, talks about not being controlled  
With me, she ignores all that, yeah, but she doesn’t ignore me  

[Verse 1]  
Waiting for you to cooperate  
To try a little of your powers  
Don’t take too long, this is the moment  
Let me feel all your movements  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So we keep going while the music keeps playing  
I look at your face and see you smiling  
They’re watching us, you like everything we’re doing  
I want this night to pass slowly  
So we keep going while the music keeps playing  
I look at your face and see you smiling  
They’re watching us, you like everything we’re doing  
I want this night to pass slowly  

[Chorus]  
She says she dances alone, talks about not being controlled  
With me, she ignores all that, dancing, the hours slip away  
She says she dances alone, talks about not being controlled  
With me, she ignores all that, yeah, but she doesn’t ignore me  

[Bridge]  
She’s the only one who arrives and shines like a star  
I’ve never seen a woman so beautiful  
Be careful with her, don’t let yourself crash, she  
She’s the only one who arrives and shines like a star  
I’ve never seen a woman so beautiful  
Be careful with her, don’t let yourself crash, ah-ah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
So we keep going while the music keeps playing  
I look at your face and see you smiling  
They’re watching us, you like everything we’re doing  
I want this night to pass slowly  
So we keep going while the music keeps playing  
I look at your face and see you smiling  
They’re watching us, you like everything we’re doing  
I want this night to pass slowly  

[Chorus]  
She says she dances alone, talks about not being controlled  
With me, she ignores all that, dancing, the hours slip away  
She says she dances alone, talks about not being controlled  
With me, she ignores all that, yeah, but she doesn’t ignore me
