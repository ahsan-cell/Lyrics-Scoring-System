**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
We bring the crew all fired up in the Toyota  
We're all bald and always smoking weed  
Now come on, don’t act like an idiot  
Now come on, call your crew  

I have some brothers who can take down your place  
It wasn’t me, I don’t know who’s around, what a mess  
A bunch like you who acts tough  
This is one hundred percent Mexico, just check out the old man  

**[Verse 1]**  
With a diamond chain that matches his bracelet  
He always carries the praise, the old man’s a million  
His people were there, all wearing their hats  
Smoking marijuana, pure kush in his joint  

Not even a roach left, the handle’s filled with gold  
With the most beautiful girls, they always watch the old man  
And he pulls out the big beers and calls the crew  
No games here, they know who’s in charge, because...  

**[Chorus]**  
We bring the crew all fired up in the Toyota  
We're all bald and always smoking weed  
Now come on, don’t act like an idiot  
Now come on, call your crew  
I have some brothers who can take down your place  
It wasn’t me, I don’t know who’s around, what a mess  
A bunch like you who acts tough  
This is one hundred percent Mexico, just check out the old man  

**[Verse 2]**  
The party doesn’t end, you can hear the gunshots  
And some are fired at the old man’s command  
The crew doesn’t stop, bags of the finest stuff  
Faces all numb, the bad vibes never arrive  

The old man’s from a family and mafia like in Sicily  
Versace always on his buckle, haters full of envy  
He doesn’t believe in the Bible with whores and cocaine  

I like to roam the mountains, grew up among the bushes  
I learned to count my money just by counting sacks  
I like to dodge the nets set by the federals  

**[Chorus & Outro]**  
Not even a roach left, the handle’s filled with gold  
With the most beautiful girls, they always watch the old man  
And he pulls out the big beers and calls the crew  
No games here, they know who’s in charge, because...  

We bring the crew all fired up in the Toyota  
We're all bald and always smoking weed  
Now come on, don’t act like an idiot  
Now come on, call your crew  
I have some brothers who can take down your place  
It wasn’t me, I don’t know who’s around, what a mess  
A bunch like you who acts tough  
This is one hundred percent Mexico, just check out the old man.
