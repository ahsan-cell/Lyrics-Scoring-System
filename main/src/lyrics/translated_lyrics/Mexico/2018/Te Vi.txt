**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Micro TDH & El Llane]  
(Uh!)  
TDH  
Piso 21 (Oh, no)  
Micro TDH (No, no, no; no, no, no)  
Piso 21 (No, no, no)  
Ovy On The Drums, On The Drums (Oh, no)  
O-O-Ovy On The Drums  

[Verse 1: Micro TDH]  
I don’t know what it is about your gaze  
Maybe it’s the way you dance  
When we kiss  
We feel like we’re into each other  
And when I have you in my arms  
Time flies by, oh, oh  

[Chorus: DIM & El Llane]  
And when I saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you (Saw you, saw you)  
I fell in love right away, it was instant (-stant)  
And now that you’re here, here, here  
I want to make sure you have a good time, the best of times  
And when I saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you (No)  
I fell in love right away (Yeah)  
It was instant  
Now that you’re here, here, here, baby  
I want to make sure you have a good time, the best of times, whoa  

[Verse 2: Pablito, Micro TDH, Both]  
We shared a few kisses and nothing happened  
I just wanted to know if you liked it  
When you laughed, I loved it  
And I was like crazy, lost in your gaze  
That kiss we shared at night while you danced  
Those are things I didn’t expect  
I felt like you liked me (Hey!)  

[Pre-Chorus: Micro TDH]  
You have the formula and the vibe, eh  
Give me a little spin and start to dance, eh  
I like you so much, that if you leave  
I get nervous and start to shake (Uh)  
I’m not interested anymore, babe, in the others  
Move that body and come closer to me, to me (To me; hey!)  

[Chorus: Micro TDH & El Llane]  
And when I saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you (Oh, no)  
I fell in love right away, it was instant  
And now that you’re here, here, here (Oh, no)  
I want to make sure you have a good time, the best of times  
And when I saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you (No)  
I fell in love right away (Yeah)  
It was instant  
Now that you’re here, here, here, baby  
I want to make sure you have a good time, the best of times, whoa  

[Verse 3: DIM & Micro TDH]  
I don’t know what it is about your gaze  
Maybe it’s the way you dance  
When we kiss, we feel like we’re into each other  
And when I have you in my arms, time flies by (Brrr, Yeah-eh)  
(Hey)  

[Pre-Chorus: Micro TDH]  
You have the formula and the vibe, eh  
Give me a little spin and start to dance, eh  
I like you so much, that if you leave  
I get nervous and start to shake  
I’m not interested anymore, babe, in the others  
Move that body and come closer to me, to me  

[Chorus: DIM & El Llane]  
And when I saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you  
I fell in love right away, it was instant  
And now that you’re here, here, here  
I want to make sure you have a good time, the best of times  
And when I saw you, saw you, saw you, saw you (No)  
I fell in love right away (Yeah)  
It was instant  
Now that you’re here, here, here, baby  
I want to make sure you have a good time, the best of times (Whoa)
