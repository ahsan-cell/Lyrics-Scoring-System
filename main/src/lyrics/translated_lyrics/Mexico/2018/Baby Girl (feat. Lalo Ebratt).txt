**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Mario Bautista & Lalo Ebratt]  
It's just that with your skin, you wrap me up (Prr, prr)  
You wrap me like a serpent (Skrrt)  
Poison that doesn't kill me  
Poison that makes me strong (Prr, prr)  

[Pre-Chorus: Lalo Ebratt]  
Oh, baby  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me  
I get goosebumps when you touch me  
Poison my lips  
Oh, come on  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me (Prr, prr)  
You know you drive me crazy, crazy  

[Chorus: Mario Bautista]  
Bite me again and again, again and again  
I want to taste you too, yeah  
Come on, take away my stress  
Be whatever you want to be  
Be a Barbie girl  

[Verse 1: Lalo Ebratt]  
Through your sea, you have me sailing (Prr)  
I named my boat after you (Skrrt, skrrt)  
I was waiting for you  
You know where and when (You know, it baby)  
And tell me what you want with me  
Like I want with you (Haha)  
I don’t know why I like you so much  
I don’t know why I like you so much (Prr, prr)  

[Verse 2: Lalo Ebratt]  
All the girls are giving it away heavy (Pshh, pshh)  
All the scooters are penny boards, haha  
Red looks good on you (So good)  
Tell your friends to spend more than a hundred (Yeah, damn)  
I kissed a girl, I liked it (So good)  
You look great, Versace  
I kissed a girl, I liked it (Another one)  
I kissed a girl  

[Chorus: Mario Bautista & Lalo Ebratt]  
Bite me again and again  
Again and again  
I want to taste you too (Alright), yeah  
Come on, take away my stress  
Be whatever you want to be  
Be a Barbie girl  

[Bridge: Lalo Ebratt]  
It's just that with your skin, you wrap me up (Tell me, baby)  
You wrap me like a serpent (Alright)  
Poison that doesn't kill me (Uh-oh, that doesn't kill me)  
Poison that makes me strong (So strong, babe, hehe)  

[Pre-Chorus: Mario Bautista & Lalo Ebratt]  
Oh, baby  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me (Kiss me)  
I get goosebumps when you touch me  
Poison my lips (He's lit)  
Oh, come on  
Kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me (Haha)  
You know I drive you crazy (Prr, prr), crazy, crazy  

[Verse 3: Lalo Ebratt]  
Mario B, she says she's into me  
Her friends talk bad about me, come on  
She says she's into me, Mario B  
Tell her, ma' G, ma'  
L-A-L-O, ma' (Haha)  
A lot of trips, MB (Haha)  

[Chorus: Mario Bautista & Lalo Ebratt]  
Bite me again and again (Skrrt)  
Again and again (Skrrt)  
I want to taste you too  
Come on, take away my stress  
Be whatever you want to be  
Be a Barbie girl  

[Outro: Lalo Ebratt]  
Sorry for the delay, we got lost in time  
To another universe, in the 2030s and beyond  
TrapicalMinds  
Mario, hehe  
We're taking over the whole party and all the baby girls, haha  
That's right, mami
