**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Romeo Santos & Anuel AA]  
Check, check (Remix)  
I'm gonna show you why I'm the king of this game  
Uah  
(KOB, Real Until Death, baby)

[Verse 1: Romeo Santos]  
When a woman decides to be bad and doesn’t want a master  
Probably a man deceived her in life, without feelings  
Party, she buried the past in the grave  
The bad girl is alive, the good one is deceased  
Now, to hell with the envy of all  
Every fool that approaches her, she ignores  
So quiet she used to be, the little girl  
Now she’s fire  
I see her hunting with twenty bottles  
I sense trouble  
I’m attentive to her desires  
If she asks me like R. Kelly, I’ll- (Nasty)  
I don’t like little girls  
I only do what excites her  
He failed her-ó-ó and betrayed her-ó-ó  
Now she’s going to take revenge in my bed

[Chorus: Anuel AA]  
She wants to drink, she wants to dance  
Her boyfriend left her, and she wants to forget  
She gave herself to him, and he let her down  
And that’s why she’s going out to party (to party)  
She wants to drink, she wants to dance  
Her boyfriend left her, and she wants to forget  
She gave herself to him, and he let her down  
And that’s why she’s going out to party

[Verse 2: Anuel AA, Anuel AA & Romeo Santos]  
In the Phantom, I’m coming to get you  
Baby, you’ll never forget me (Baby)  
I need you to teach me how to love (to love)  
Baby girl, I’m going to devour you  
Baby girl, your body and you excite me (uah)  
Inside, you need me  
You will always be my little devil  
My crazy girl, so wet  
Your body and you excite me  
Inside, you need me  
You will always be my little devil  
My crazy girl, so beautiful

[Chorus: Romeo Santos]  
She wants to drink, she wants to dance  
Her boyfriend left her, and she wants to forget  
She gave herself to him, and he let her down  
And that’s why she’s going out to party  
She wants to drink, she wants to dance  
Her boyfriend left her, and she wants to forget  
She gave herself to him, and he let her down  
And that’s why she’s going out to party

[Verse 3: Anuel AA]  
She was looking at me from afar  
Dancing on a thread of Romeo (uah)  
She never listened to the advice  
In her eyes, I always see my reflections  
He failed her-ó-ó and betrayed her-ó-ó  
She got drunk-ó and escaped with me-ó-ó  
Twenty bottles, pink champagne  
The baby girl desired me (uah)  
A little devil, she devoured me (uah)  
And I buried myself inside her skin (uah)  
Oh my God, how good, baby (baby)  
Her body takes over me (over me)  
Shaking in an orgasm for me (for me)  
Real Until Death, baby

[Chorus: Anuel AA & Romeo Santos]  
She wants to drink, she wants to dance (dance)  
Her boyfriend left her, and she wants to forget  
She gave herself to him, and he let her down  
And that’s why she’s going out to party  
She wants to drink, she wants to dance  
Her boyfriend left her, and she wants to forget  
She gave herself to him, and he let her down  
And that’s why she’s going out to party

[Outro: Anuel AA & Romeo Santos]  
Uah-uah, eh  
Hey, tell me, Romeo  
The Untouchables, The Illuminati  
The most badass remix  
I’m with the king, you hear me, baby?  
Baby  
Real Until Death
