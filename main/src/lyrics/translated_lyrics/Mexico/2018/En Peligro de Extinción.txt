**[Verse 1]**  
I'm leaving, but I'm taking everything I offered you  
If I ever said I loved you  
I won't say it again  
The hours in the early morning  
When you couldn't sleep  
Who was the one that kept you company  
The one who was always there?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
If you had asked me  
I swear I would have run to the ends of the earth  
To give you my hand  
But there's the catch  
I wasn't reciprocated  

**[Chorus]**  
You missed out on a huge heart  
That in these times is endangered  
One of those that serenades but with its own voice  
You missed out on a February 14th  
That starts in January and renews the New Year  
You missed out on what you won't find  
Anywhere else  

**[Instrumental Interlude]**  
Addictive  

**[Chorus]**  
You missed out on a huge heart  
That in these times is endangered  
One of those that serenades but with its own voice  
You missed out on a February 14th  
That starts in January and renews the New Year  
You missed out on what you won't find  
Anywhere else  
You missed out on what you won't find  
Anywhere else
