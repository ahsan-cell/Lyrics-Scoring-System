**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yatra, Yatra  
Okay, yes, yes  
Mau and Ricky  

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]  
It's been a while since they saw her, but today she went out to drink  
Because she no longer has a boyfriend  
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I’ll respond  
Because I don’t have a girlfriend (And now she’s all mine)  
It's been a while since they saw her, but today she went out to drink  
Because she no longer has a boyfriend (And now she’s all mine)  
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I’ll respond  
Because I don’t have a girlfriend (And now she’s all mine)  

[Verse 1: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]  
The last time I saw her  
She was with some guy around  
What a strange thing, now she’s all over me  
What’s happening? What’s happening?  
I don’t know, I know  
But it seems like she wants to get back at him, him  

[Pre-Chorus: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]  
If your boyfriend breaks up with you, I have the best medicine  
If your boyfriend breaks up with you, mix rum with tequila (Oh)  

[Chorus: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]  
It's been a while since they saw her, but today she went out to drink  
Because she no longer has a boyfriend (Because she no longer has a boyfriend)  
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I’ll respond  
Because I don’t have a girlfriend (And now she’s all mine)  
It's been a while since they saw her, but today she went out to drink  
Because she no longer has a boyfriend (Because she no longer has a boyfriend)  
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I’ll respond  
Because I don’t have a girlfriend (And now she’s all mine)  

[Post-Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Because I have what her boyfriend didn’t  

[Verse 2: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
In just two minutes, she’s on top of me  
She wants me to make her mine tonight  
To grab her and take her to the corner  
And I know I have what Yatra didn’t  
She’s stuck to me, stuck to me, no one took her away  
She’s stuck to me, stuck to me, I think she’s fallen for me  
She’s stuck to me, stuck to me, never let go  
She’s stuck to me, stuck to me  

[Pre-Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
If your boyfriend (If your boyfriend) breaks up with you (Breaks up with you)  
I have the best medicine  
If your boyfriend (If your boyfriend) breaks up with you (Breaks up with you)  
Mix rum with tequila  

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
It's been a while since they saw her, but today she went out to drink  
Because she no longer has a boyfriend (And now she’s all mine)  
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I’ll respond  
Because I don’t have a girlfriend  

[Post-Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Because I have what her boyfriend didn’t  

[Bridge: Sebastián Yatra, Mau and Ricky]  
With her killer voice, she tells me:  
“Yatra, let’s go, my house is empty”  
This isn’t over  
We started in the living room and ended up in the pool  

[Pre-Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
If your boyfriend (If your boyfriend) breaks up with you (Breaks up with you)  
I have the best medicine  
If your boyfriend (If your boyfriend) breaks up with you (Breaks up with you)  
Mix rum with tequila  

[Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
It's been a while since they saw her, but today she went out to drink  
Because she no longer has a boyfriend  
She knows how I am, if she calls me, I’ll respond  
Because I don’t have a girlfriend (And now she’s all mine)  

[Post-Chorus: Mau and Ricky, Sebastián Yatra]  
Oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh (
