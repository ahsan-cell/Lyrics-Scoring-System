**Translated Lyrics:**

[Bridge: Jesús, Maluma]  
I lend you my eyes, so you can see how beautiful you are (mmh, mmh)  
I lend you my hands, to touch the clouds if you want (oh, oh)  
I lend you my fingers so you can remember  
Everything we did that Friday night  
I lend you my kisses, and you give them back to me  
That way I have an excuse to see you again  

[Pre-Chorus: Jesús]  
I’m not asking you to fall in love  
Let’s be eternal just for tonight  
I’m not asking you to be my girlfriend  
If as friends we already give each other everything  

[Chorus: Maluma, Maluma & Jesús, Jesús]  
Friends with benefits  
And all your heartaches  
You let go of them with me like no one else has done  
Friends with benefits  
Let it be our secret  
That only the walls bear witness to what we have  

[Verse 1: Maluma, Jesús]  
(Hey, hey, listen to how we met, haha, come on)  
It was eight fifteen in the square of San Juan  
You were walking with a couple of friends  
You played coy, like you didn’t want to  
You shot me a mysterious glance, yeah  
Kill me, with that little mouth intoxicate me (intoxicate me)  
Come, seduce me with your body  
Let’s take off our clothes, because you look sexier naked  
To me, you’re my lady  
I’m your Maluma, baby (hahaha)  
Friends with benefits, enjoy yourself (haha, muah)  

[Bridge: Jesús]  
I-I-I lend you my fingers so you can remember  
Everything we did that Friday night  
I lend you my kisses, and you give them back to me  
That way I have an excuse to see you again  

[Pre-Chorus: Jesús]  
I’m not asking you to fall in love  
Let’s be eternal just for tonight  
I’m not asking you to be my girlfriend  
If as friends we already give each other everything  

[Chorus: Maluma, Maluma & Jesús, Jesús]  
Friends with benefits  
And all your heartaches  
You let go of them with me like no one else has done  
Friends with benefits  
Let it be our secret  
That only the walls bear witness to what we have  

[Outro: Jesús, Maluma]  
Uh-uh-uh-uh (woh-oh)  
Uh-uh-uh-uh (yeh-eh)  
Let’s kiss and let it be our secret  
Uh-uh-uh-uh (woh-oh)  
Uh-uh-uh-uh (yeh-eh)  
Even though everyone already suspects what we have  
(Says, says)  
Uh-uh-uh-uh  
(Maluma, baby)  
Uh-uh-uh-uh  
(Tell me, Reik)  
Even though everyone already suspects what we have  
(Colombia, Mexico, worldwide, baby)
