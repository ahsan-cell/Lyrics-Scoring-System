**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Ozuna]  
(Hehe, woah-oh; Au-Aura, haha)  
It’s not going to be that easy (Easy, easy)  
Even if you dodge me, still  
I’m after you, I’m after you (You, yeah!)  
You have everything I want for me  

[Pre-Chorus: Manuel Turizo]  
And you all alone out there  
I’m going to keep following you  
I know that good things take time, lady  

[Chorus: Ozuna & Manuel Turizo]  
It’s just that I only like you  
I don’t care about the others  
It’s a crazy feeling I have  
That no matter how hard I try, it won’t go away  
I only like you  
I don’t care about the others  
It’s a crazy feeling I have  
That no matter how hard I try, it won’t go away  

[Verse 1: Ozuna]  
I only like you, I can’t hide it  
The music I make only makes me think of you (Whoa, oh!)  
Unique, a rose; I want to steal her (Baby)  
Simple, beautiful; she doesn’t need to wear makeup  
Her style kills me, she dances hard and goes for it  
She doesn’t commit to anyone, especially if you promise her  
She has what I want (Whoa); she calls me, I’ll be there (Yeah, eh)  
I can’t hide it, I dance with you and I give in  
Her style kills me, she dances hard and goes for it  
She doesn’t commit to anyone, especially if you promise her  
She has what I want (Whoa); she calls me, I’ll be there (Yeah, eh)  
I can’t hide it, I dance with you and I give in  

[Chorus: Ozuna & Manuel Turizo]  
It’s just that I only like you (Only you)  
I don’t care about the others (Others)  
It’s a crazy feeling I have  
That no matter how hard I try, it won’t go away  
It’s just that I only like you (Only you)  
I don’t care about the others (Others)  
It’s a crazy feeling I have  
That no matter how hard I try, it won’t go away  

[Verse 2: Manuel Turizo]  
Because when I have you close  
A crazy feeling hits me that doesn’t go away  
You’re my favorite on my list  
You’re the only one this man needs  
Lady, what I want  
Is worth more than money  
I’d travel the whole world  
If it’s for you, there are no buts  
I feel like I’m desperate for you  
When I don’t have you, babe  

[Chorus: Ozuna & Manuel Turizo]  
It’s just that I only like you  
I don’t care about the others  
It’s a crazy feeling I have  
That no matter how hard I try, it won’t go away  
I only like you  
I don’t care about the others  
It’s a crazy feeling I have  
That no matter how hard I try, it won’t go away
