**[Verse]**  
I'm going to answer all your questions right now  
To make it clear what really went down  
The night you left, things happened  
The same things your friend already told you  
And you know what?  

**[Chorus]**  
They didn't tell you wrong, I won't deny  
Yes, we kissed, we gave in  
But that’s as far as it went  
Just a few kisses, two or three caresses  
Desire took over, I wanted her to be mine  
There was some flirting, but what was I supposed to do?  
They didn't tell you wrong, I was with someone else  
What does it matter if it wasn't during your time?  
What do you have to say?  
If it wasn't many, just one person  
If I was drunk, it was your fault  
And in the end, one is none  

**[Interlude]**  
And one is none, my queen
