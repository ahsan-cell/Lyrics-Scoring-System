**Translated Lyrics:**

I can't stop thinking  
About your angelic face  
You drive me crazy all day long  
I love your pretty eyes  
It's not a lie  

Your smile enchants  
The body you carry, your scent drives me wild  
I want to steal everything  
So we can be together, just us  
To give love  

I'm a romantic man  
You'd see how I am  
For you, I'll be whatever you want, my love  
Ask me for anything, and I'll make it happen  

I'm coming to you, and honestly, I feel better  
When I look at you, it seems like an angel came down  
Everything is more perfect when you're with me  

I want to be the man  
Who gives you everything, so you lack nothing  
Take you to explore  
Travel the world with you, I know that  
You're the only woman I want to see  
Every morning, let’s have coffee  
And watch the moon at sunset  

When we go out for a night stroll  
I feel a vibe  
Music playing just the way I like  
If you cry, I'll give you my shoulder  
I know you feel the same  

Watching movies together  
In bed, or maybe you want  
To kiss me all over  
My body and cover my eyes  
While you play  

I can tell you I love you a thousand times  
I would never get tired of having you  
You are my joy, thank you for being my woman  

I know when you're frustrated  
And when you're sad  
Baby, I'll fix that  
Don't worry  
You know very well that for you, I’d give everything  

I want to be the man  
Who gives you everything, so you lack nothing  
Take you to explore  
Travel the world with you, I know that  
You're the only woman I want to see  
Every morning, let’s have coffee  
And watch the moon at sunset
