**Translated Lyrics:**

Feel the destiny in your palms  
The power in the word  
Fear dressed in calm  
Jesus walks on water  
The expression on the face  
The coldness in the gaze  
The faith that moves mountains  
The spirit is a sacred weapon  

They want to talk to me about jewels, about grams of gold  
That I haven't even looked at  
They want to talk to me about planes and transports  
That I've never boarded  
Talk to me about clothes, they don’t repeat outfits, with egos inflated  
They want to show off, I have to say  
That I never repeat the flows I've already rapped  
To the grave, no one has taken  
Any cent I've earned  
Nor any accessory I've bought  
That can pull you out of a winning mess  

Virtues aren’t counted  
They’re not pressured by the breeze  
The spirit becomes visible  
Without tricks, like a smile  

(Chorus)  
They have the hype that I don’t have  
They have the girl that I don’t have  
They have what I don’t have  
But they don’t have this that I do, nigga  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at...  

They have the hype that I don’t have  
They have the girl that I don’t have  
They have what I don’t have  
But they don’t have this that I do, nigga  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at...  

(Verse 2)  
A man is made of spirit  
Not different women  
A man is made of spirit  
Not mansions for rent  
A man is made of spirit  
Not shining diamonds  
Duels face to face  
Knowing how to handle the current  
You can’t manage a situation of arguments  
With what you’ve bought  
You can’t win balance when trust  
Rests on total chaos  
Putting your worth in the weight of material goods  
That you hold most dear  
The hand of man builds the gods that he himself  
With all his faith has revered  

Against those I’ve conversed with  
They can’t bend my stance once  
Passion and words I defend with faith  
At the right moment knowing how to respond  
Intelligent movements  
Knowing how to wait for the next  
Who says they fear nothing, lies  
The merit is not to stop  

(Bridge)  
How many have tried  
To make me feel threatened  
I have my pulse racing  
But in a lit-up mode  

To those who have tried  
To make me feel threatened  
From here, a big shout out  
There’s no way, man  

(Chorus)  
They have the hype that I don’t have  
They have the girl that I don’t have  
They have what I don’t have  
But they don’t have this that I do, nigga  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at...  

They have the hype that I don’t have  
They have the girl that I don’t have  
They have what I don’t have  
But they don’t have this that I do, nigga  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at all  
No, no, not at...
