**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I love you, my life, there’s no one else  
Who fills this soul, you make me dream  
Your presence drives me wild, your body fascinates  
Let me be your guard, I’ll never let you go  

[Verse 2]  
Your eyes work magic, your kisses calm me  
I still feel butterflies just from talking  
I don’t want just a few days, I want eternity  
To be yours alone, what do you say, beautiful?  

[Chorus]  
I want to love you and caress you, give you the moon  
Show you the world, sing you a whole romance  
You deserve everything and more, to me, you’re special  

[Verse 3]  
I speak and you smile, nothing looks bad on you  
You call me, and I’m right there with you  
You define perfection, and that’s no lie  
From our first date, I knew it was you  

[Chorus]  
I want to love you and caress you, give you the moon  
Show you the world, sing you a whole romance  
You deserve everything and more, to me, you’re special
