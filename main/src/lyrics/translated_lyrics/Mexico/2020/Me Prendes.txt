**[Verse 1]**  
I wish I could have you here so close  
To bite your lips, I know you’re enchanted by me  
And we need to stop playing, my girl  
Better to light up a joint  
Honestly, you ignite me when you get near  
I can’t explain it  
What I bring is something more than just a special love  
You drive me crazy all day long  

**[Chorus]**  
You look so good in that dress  
Every time I see you, I’m left amazed  
You turn around, beautiful skin like silk  
Gorgeous girl, let me show off all your beauty  
You are everything I’ve ever wanted  
I ask for no one else, for you I’m in a frenzy  
If there’s any problem, it’s easy to fix  
In bed, we’ll solve it, let’s settle our differences  

**[Verse 2]**  
Light the candles, close the curtains  
We’ll drink some bottles, it’s all a mess  
Between smoke and drinks, I rise up  
Let’s lose ourselves together for a while  
Here, there are no lessons, no rules exist  
With two, if it’s not bad, I know what I’m talking about  
I’m out of my mind, you’ve done something to me  
Like a spell, I’m at your command
