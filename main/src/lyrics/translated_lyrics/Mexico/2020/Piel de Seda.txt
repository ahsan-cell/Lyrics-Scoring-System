**Translated Lyrics:**

At night I watch her  
In a black dress  
With heels so high, they make her walk so beautifully  
Her smile so tender  
Her little pearl-like eyes  
And the moonlight reflects on her silky skin  
On her silky skin  

And as I take her hand  
I kiss her sweet lips  
I get lost in her gaze, no words can explain it  
Her smile so tender  
Her little pearl-like eyes  
And the moonlight reflects on her silky skin  
On her silky skin  

Have you ever seen  
The sun nestle with the waves of the sea?  
The night has come  
I begin this dream and I donâ€™t plan to wake up  

Oh no, oh no no  
No oh no
