**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
A big joint full of weed, maybe it'll get me feeling right  
Oh-oh  
A little bag of washed stuff to get me high tonight  
The cooler instead of beer, little bottles for the thirst  
And the recipe for the strawberries that just don’t mix well  
In races, they’re like horses, I always love to bet  
The truck with a good sound, the windows are gonna shake  
The pretty girls want to join in, they asked me for a smoke  
They want to chill out and relax

[Chorus]  
I want to get high  
With booze and beer, live music playing  
I want to party  
I want to smoke  
Red eyes, it seems like we’ll be floating in the clouds  
We’re about to take off

[Interlude]  
A promise is a debt, my friend Abram

[Verse 2]  
It’s the weekend and it’s going great, as it seems  
A big hit so we can roll to the party  
Abram Vasquez is coming, bringing his accordion to liven things up  
It’s the weekend and it looks like it’s going fantastic  
Through the back door, hanging out with my buddies  
I’m feeling high and our buddy with the lyre is gonna play for us  

[Chorus]  
I want to get high  
With booze and beer, live music playing  
I want to party  
I want to smoke  
Red eyes, it seems like we’ll be floating in the clouds  
We’re about to take off
