**[Intro]**  
Bad reputation, bad reputation, bad reputation  
Good life  

**[Chorus]**  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  

**[Verse 1]**  
Many said that this rap thing was pointless  
That I was just a thug, a gangbanger, and a stoner  
That I wouldn’t make money because I’m all tattooed  
That I’m always drunk, that I’m always high  
Many said I was good for nothing  
That I only served to mess around  
Always rapping on the corner about what was happening  
With a beer in hand and my head shaved  
Mistaken, everyone was mistaken  
Let them say what they want, but they were wrong  
Now those people look at me in awe  
And when I see them face to face, they all look down  
That guy hangs out with crazies and whores  
That he’s involved in many troubles and disputes  
I hate how they ask questions  
To hell with all those sons of bitches  

**[Chorus]**  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  

**[Verse 2]**  
That people like me never succeed  
That I messed up my life by tattooing my neck and hands  
Brothers, that’s why we are where we are  
It’s the brain, it doesn’t matter how we look  
My rap is sounding everywhere  
The tracks I drop hit hard  
They thought I’d never get out of the hood  
And today I live among doctors, engineers, and lawyers  
Everyone was tripping, they were really tripping  
Let them say what they want, they were tripping  
Now they see me and get mad  
Enjoying life while they’re stuck in their dead-end jobs  
Better not comment if you don’t know the deal (Deal)  
I’m traveling the world with my flow (Flow)  
When they see me, envious, they say wow (Wow)  
And I’m making money, money, money, mo', mo', mo'  

**[Chorus]**  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  

**[Verse 3]**  
Today I’m enjoying time with my crew  
At the airport, everyone asks for my autograph  
After the concert, it’s all about the beautiful ladies  
And I’m like Pikachu, just having fun  
Today my song is topping several charts  
And the whole crowd is amazed by the beats  
On YouTube, the videos have tons of views  
You can see my face on posters and magazines  
Let’s be realistic, they judged me wrong  
They thought I couldn’t do it, but I did, man  
I carry the best material and an international flow  
And honestly, I’m doing just fine  

**[Chorus]**  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doubted me is now regretting it  
Dude, it was awesome  
They said I wouldn't make it, but yeah, I did  
I made it big, the fire's lit  
And everyone who doub
