**Translated Lyrics:**

I make a call to the plug, he drops by in no time  
A shot of poison, a quick hit, and I roll a joint  
Songs from the legends, also dust-filled corridos  
Ladies from various nationalities, all at my whim  

This isn’t just another corrido from hard times  
Here there’s cash and plenty of work to fly around the world  
I’m grateful for my friends and partners  
We should enjoy life since it’s borrowed and fleeting  

You can hear the speakers of my truck through the streets  
Also, the revs when there’s a fair ahead  
Some wild girls because I want to celebrate  
F***ing with the fish scales got me high and I love it  

I hold my hand up in the air, throwing the H  
Light a red Marlboro, take a drink, and roll a blunt  
713 is the code for my cell to unlock it  
I call my buddy to take another trip  

You’ll find me in Houston, Texas, that’s where I reside  
Swanging and banging in the trucks with the corridos  
Tinted windows, crocodile seats  
Fish scales, chrome rims, all polished and clean
