**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
This is a true Hollywood beat

[Chorus: Ovi]  
At twelve years old, I started hustling (Yeah)  
I was out on the streets, already living wild  
And I come from the hood (Yah!), and that was necessary (Yah!)  
So today, fame and cash don’t lack in my pocket  
New cars and the girls calling (Yah!)  
And I keep winning

[Verse 1: Ovi & RobGz]  
Yeah, uh  
No need to worry, the turn has been crowned  
Thanks to my mother for always praying to God (Yah!)  
And to that fake friend who bit the hand that fed him  
I wish him my blessings (Yeah)  
And here I stand firm, ready for action (With the same ones, with my people)  
I fear nothing, respect and money before life (Come on, tell me, Nata)

[Chorus: Natanael Cano]  
At twelve years old, I started rolling  
I come from the hood, I became a millionaire  
Now I drive a Lambo, and I’m not a thug  
At nineteen, I dove headfirst into work, into business  
We’ve got the zeros and the accounts filling up  
And I’m not slacking (I’m not slacking)

[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & RobGz]  
I don’t forget my people, I’ve made it clear, that’s it  
My buddy Dan Sánchez from Sonora and some others around  
Long live my land where the whole crew was founded  
We’re laid back, we’re hustling  
Number one, winning on the Billboard charts  
Dude, who are you? I come from the hood (Haha)

[Verse 3: RobGz]  
In the streets since I was a kid  
Hustling at the Lizard with all my brothers (Pew)  
Weighing out the grams (-ing out the grams)  
That’s how we started (That’s how we started; haha)  
I was struggling, now I’m a platinum artist (Haha)  
And the same people who talk about me (They keep talking)  
Are now riding my wave (They’re riding my wave)  
I’ve lost friends because of the fuckin’ money  
That keeps coming into my bank account (Keeps coming)  
They call me "Wells Fargo" (They call me "Wells Fargo")  
I bought an AP, I have five chains  
60 million views on YouTube and the Mercedes is paid off (It’s paid off)  
I keep winning (I keep winning)  
If I die one day, I don’t want a funeral  
Call the brothers, dress in black, and we’ll show up anywhere (Haha)  
And we’ll empty the clips (Hahaha)

[Outro: RobGz, Natanael Cano & Ovi]  
Come on, tell me, damn it (Yah)  
Tell me, RobGz (Nata)  
Ovi  
Come on, tell me, Ovi (Tell me, yo!)  
First Order Music  
Real until death  
And pure corridos tumbados, old school  
Come on, tell me, Holly  
Haha!
