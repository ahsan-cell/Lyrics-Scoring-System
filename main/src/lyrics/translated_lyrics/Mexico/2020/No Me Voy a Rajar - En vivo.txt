**[Intro]**  
I’m not backing down, from the corridos we bring to all of you  
Shout out to everyone out there enjoying drinks tonight  
It goes something like this  

**[Verse 1]**  
Culiacán, that’s where I belong, it’s my hometown  
Little by little I’m climbing, progressing in life, always standing strong with my brother  
With a wax joint in hand, I relax, focused on my work, lighting a blunt to smoke  
No need to talk or criticize, better to hustle  
To achieve our goals, to open a thousand doors and move forward in life  
I’m not backing down, there have been ups and downs, and right now I’ve got stacks of cash to spend  

**[Interlude]**  
And it goes  

**[Verse 2]**  
My crew is always solid and they’re on point  
Keeping an eye on the territory, watching over my people, for them, all my respect  
Here I’m in control, what I say goes, buddy, pass me another round to keep the action going  
I always dress in designer clothes, sometimes Dolce & Gabbana, maybe Balenciaga sneakers or perhaps a Louis Vuitton look  
I thank God for what He has given me  
Because my hard work has paid off, the old man is saying goodbye
