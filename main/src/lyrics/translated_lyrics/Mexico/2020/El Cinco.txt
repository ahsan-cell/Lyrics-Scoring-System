**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
For anyone who wants to know,  
We’re the ones fighting the fence.  
With so much war around here,  
The streets of Tijuana feel like hell.  
I’m about work, not conflict,  
But if they come for me, I’ll defend myself.  
Working hard for the gringos,  
And I keep all my clients happy.

[Chorus]  
And to introduce myself, I have to tell you,  
That a long time ago, I also suffered hunger.  
I preferred the streets instead of studying,  
I liked the thrill that they can tell me about.  
I’ve lived through it all, even as a kid,  
But well-seasoned, I had my reasons.  
The need was greater than the fear,  
I’ve never cared about getting into trouble.  
By code, I’m the Owl of Tijuana,  
Always watching over my territory.

This is how it sounds from your friend Luis R Conriquez, old man!

[Verse 2]  
In the Zeta, they’ve already burned me,  
But they haven’t proven anything against me.  
They think that just because I work,  
I have the instinct for killing.  
From La Tía to San Diego,  
You’ll see me in the thrill.  
Sending greetings to Five, Two, and Eleven,  
Not forgetting the old man.

[Chorus]  
And to introduce myself, I have to tell you,  
That a long time ago, I also suffered hunger.  
I preferred the streets instead of studying,  
I liked the thrill that they can tell me about.  
I’ve lived through it all, even as a kid,  
But well-seasoned, I had my reasons.  
The need was greater than the fear,  
I’ve never cared about getting into trouble.  
By code, I’m the Owl of Tijuana,  
Always watching over my territory.  
Iron!
