**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
With your kisses, you make me feel good  
I simply love the way you are  
When you walk, you could kill any man  
And with you, I truly fell in love  
You drive me crazy, thinking about you all day  
I’d dare to take you out, maybe  
Write you songs, shout your name  
I feel like I finally have someone  
To live life with, to explore constantly  
To discover romantic places too  
Take you to the moon or bring you down wherever  
You want, girl, you know I’ll fight for you  
I’ll be the man who gives you what you desire  
I know very well just by seeing you that you love me too  

[Chorus]  
When I'm with you, my torment fades away  
You calm me down with your sweet words  
There you are when I need you  
You complete my life like a book  
You’ve made no mistakes; I see you as perfect  
And if one day we argue  
I know our love won’t be torn apart  
No matter what happens, you’ll be with me  

[Interlude Instrumental]  

[Verse 2]  
Nothing is better than caressing you  
Every night, exploring your beautiful skin  
Always stunning, with or without makeup  
Your casual outfit, you don’t pretend  
That’s why I fell in love the first time  
I knew it would be different with you  
I hope what we have never ends  

[Chorus]  
My skin tingles when you get close  
Your lovely smile captivates me  
You whisper sweet nothings in my ear  
You bite your lips and hypnotize me  
Close the curtains, light some candles  
What I want right now, you want too  
This song is for you, my girl  
A thousand thanks for having me in your life
