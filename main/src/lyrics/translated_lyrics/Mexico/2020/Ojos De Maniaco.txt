**[Verse 1]**  
A black cure opening the way  
In a rough manner, with a cunning gaze  
Cruising through the streets of the Californias  
Heating up pipes, my mind well lit  
I hear the horns booming  
The windows vibrate with corridos that inspire  
I work hard, that's why I enjoy my luxuries  
It's not magic, it’s about being tough  

**[Chorus]**  
I also have to sweat for a taco  
Nothing I have has been given for free, here we go  
Working, battling to earn it all  
If you see me with manic eyes  
Don’t worry, you know I’m making moves, and off we go  
We’ll keep climbing but without looking down  

**[Interlude]**  
Pure Legado 7, old friend  
Here we are still climbing  
My buddy Junior H, right, my friend?  

**[Verse 2]**  
A black cure opening the way  
Good because I like it, I’m out here enjoying  
Cruising through the streets of the Californias  
With some girls, the party begins  
Roll a joint and light it up hot  
To set the mood, relax the mind  
The speedometer marks over a hundred  
No control, in this I run with the wind  

**[Chorus]**  
I also have to sweat for a taco  
Nothing I have is given for free, here we go  
Working, battling to earn it all  
If you see me with manic eyes  
Don’t worry, you know I’m making moves, there we go  
I’ll keep climbing but without looking down
