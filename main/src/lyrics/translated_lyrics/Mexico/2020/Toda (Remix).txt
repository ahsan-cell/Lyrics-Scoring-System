**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Alex Rose & Rauw Alejandro]  
D-Note Is On The Beat  
(Wo-oh)  
The Beatllionaire  
(Mmm; Baby)  
(Wo-oh; ¡yeah!)

[Verse 1: Alex Rose & Lenny Tavárez]  
I already know you, I see it on your face  
Don’t hold back, with me you can be bad  
I’ll be yours for tonight  
You’ll let go before I unbuckle the seatbelt (¡Woh!)  
Tell me what positions you want (¡Hey!)  
I know you have a boyfriend, but you prefer me  
I’ll be yours for tonight (¡Wuh!)

[Chorus: Lenny Tavárez]  
Get ready, baby, because today I want to devour you whole  
He does it halfway, I kiss you all over  
Stay with me and I’ll ditch them all  
Like no one else, you outshine them all  
That’s why, baby, I want to devour you whole  
He does it halfway, I kiss you all over  
Stay with me and I’ll ditch them all  
He leaves you dry, I’ll make you wet all over, I’ll make you wet all over, baby

[Verse 2: Alex Rose]  
Everyone wants you because there’s no one like you  
And for you, I’d even pull down the moon (¡Hey!)  
There are many women  
Life is only one  
Just say yes so I can give it to you right away (Ah)  
Baby girl, just let me know (Just let me know)  
To roll down the windows  
Light up and take off my shirt (¡Woh!)  
I want you to be my submissive (Submissive)  
If you want, take your time, relax, I’m not in a hurry  
Because the night is young  
And your guy doesn’t even notice  
That jerk is fake, he doesn’t have what he pretends, yeah  
You’re too much for him (¡Woh!)  
That’s what they say

[Verse 3: Lenny Tavárez]  
(Lenny Tavárez, baby, eh-eh)  
I don’t know if we love each other (We love each other)  
You’re with him, but it’s been a while since we’ve seen each other (¡Wuh!)  
Whenever we’re alone, we get wild and eat each other up (Ah-ah)  
With me, your inhibitions go to the extreme  
And that jerk with that act (Brrra)  
You don’t go out with him anymore, you feel ridiculous (Ridiculous)  
You prefer to stay home alone so you can call me  
And I’m ready to pick you up when you need me (Hehe)  
Send me a Snapchat of that (-that)  
A selfie blowing me kisses (-kisses)  
I’m on my way to bring you the goods (The goods)  
When I crossed the line, I didn’t make a mistake  
If they find out, say I provoked you

[Chorus: Alex Rose & Lyanno]  
Because today I want to devour you whole  
He does it halfway, I kiss you all over  
Stay with me and I’ll ditch them all  
Like no one else, you outshine them all  
That’s why, baby, I want to devour you whole  
He does it halfway, I kiss you all over  
Stay with me and I’ll ditch them all  
You tell me, baby girl, and we’ll go all out (Sh-sh)  
To devour you whole, yeah

[Verse 4: Lyanno]  
Ly-Ly-Ly  
With you, I have fantasies since high school  
Handcuffs and whips, you know what’s up  
Even smoking Kush to get you high  
And in bed, telling your boyfriend: "Bye"  
Clueless, clueless as hell  
Always using protection  
And to top it off, he plays all my songs  
To leave him, I gave you sixty-nine thousand reasons  
Your heart beats for me, more than twelve hearts  
And we do it slow  
When we kiss, time stops  
Without words, we enjoy the moment  
And we repeat the story

[Chorus: Lyanno]  
Baby, because I want to mistreat you all over  
He does it halfway, I kiss you all over  
Stay with me and I’ll ditch them all  
Like no one else, you outshine them all (You outshine them all)

[Verse 5: Rauw Alejandro]  
(Yeah, Ra-Rauw)  
You were made for me  
I knew it that night I had you  
Appreciating all your nakedness  
When my tongue ran all over your skin  
I was made for you
