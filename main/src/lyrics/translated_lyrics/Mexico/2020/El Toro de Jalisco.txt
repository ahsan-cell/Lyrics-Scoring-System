**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
In the lands of Jalisco  
They see him quite often there  
A good drink of whiskey  
It's because he's been up all night  

[Instrumental Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
In the lands of Jalisco  
They see him quite often there  
A good drink of whiskey  
It's because he's been up all night  

[Verse 1]  
With guitars and norte√±o tunes  
They always see us happy  
That school was taught by the old man  
How I appreciate that gesture  

[Verse 2]  
A wild beast came from the hills  
It's neither a panther nor a coyote  
This bull is already well-known  
That's how they refer to the man  

[Interlude]  
Here we come, fully loaded  
Pure Maximo Grado and Clave 520, cousin  
To the front, with R Records  

[Verse 3]  
I'm armed, never too trusting  
Wherever we go, we secure it  
Ready for any altercation  
Many know I'm not one to back down  

[Verse 4]  
And I greet my buddy Ruso  
That old man is very clever  
I always remember the guayabo*  
Since we were kids, he hasn't backed out  

[Verse 5]  
Now I take my leave, my crew  
Too much ink, the pages won't suffice  
This story is quite long  
See you later, my crew  

(*Guayabo refers to a type of fruit, but in this context, it may symbolize a person or a memory associated with childhood.)
