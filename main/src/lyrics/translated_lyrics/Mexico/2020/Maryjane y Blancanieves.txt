**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Let’s get right to it, buddy  
I’ve got a cigarette of the kind you like  
Listening to green corridos to light it up  
Talking about the times when there was no cash  

[Verse 2]  
I’ve invited some friends, they say they’ll be here soon  
They love to chill with the scent of grass  
With a little heat, Mary Jane takes flight  
And with a bit of whiskey, Snow White gets wild  

[Chorus]  
Because with smoke, the mind relaxes  
And with the girls, we’re having a good time, calm and steady  
Just chatting, and we’re only laughing  
Oh, we’ll remember another day like this  
Rolling another blunt is our buddy Gio  
He rolls good stuff, loves to be high  
A little red seal to keep it smooth  
Oh, we’ll keep going until we see the sun  

[Interlude]  
And bring it out to make it smell, you sly old man  
Eah  

[Chorus]  
Because with smoke, the mind relaxes  
And with the girls, we’re having a good time, calm and steady  
Just chatting, and we’re only laughing  
Oh, we’ll remember another day like this  
Rolling another blunt is our buddy Gio  
He rolls good stuff, loves to be high  
A little red seal to keep it smooth  
We’ll keep going until we see the sun
