**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
We left home chasing a dream when no one was watching us from above  
We have dreams and goals that no one in the world would see  
Because we are like this, because this is what we were meant to live  
Because we were born this way, we simply live life, I am happy  

[Verse 1]  
I don’t care what they say, I’m always on top  
Cannabis sativa, the one that controls me  
The one I carry with me, the one that brings me down  
The one that always lifts me up  
The time that passes, I burn it in my mind  
Thinking of things I would do to you  
I would devour you if you were mine  
But it doesn’t matter, you didn’t deserve it  
Tell me, what are you going to do?  
If tomorrow you want to come back  
You know well that I’m not okay  
Not for stories, wasting time  
Remember, I’m always on top  
Working day and night  
With the whole crew, they see me  
Celebrating with bottles and girls  

[Refrain]  
Just tell me if you want to be with me or if I should just go (Ah, ah)  
Your kisses say you really want me but your words don’t  

[Chorus]  
We left home chasing a dream when no one was watching us from above  
We have dreams and goals that no one in the world would see  
Because we are like this, because this is what we were meant to live  
Because we were born this way, we simply live life, I am happy  

[Interlude]  
And this isn’t the same old story, you know?  
¡Nata!  
And here we are, Rancho Humilde, old-timers  
Ah, ah, ah, hahaha  
Tell me, Krizous  

[Verse 2]  
We left home chasing a dream and when I least expected it, I reached it  
We have the cars, the jets  
Friends, women, greens  
We smoke, we’re going to Mars  
Baby, I just want to give you  
Lay down with you in bed  
Sorry for being a fake  

[Refrain]  
Just tell me if you want to be with me or if I should just go (Ah, ah)  
Your kisses say you really want me but your words don’t
