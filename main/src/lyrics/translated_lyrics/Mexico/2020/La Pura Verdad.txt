**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part I]**

**[Verse 1]**  
I only add up, never subtract (Eh-yeh)  
I roll with the real ones, you with the fakes (Eh-yeh)  
I assure you, I never rented  
I’m original, and who are you? (Yes, yes)  
With all the gear, iron, and cash (Iron)  
It came to me naturally, I didn’t force it (Eh)  
You try so hard, I made it (Uh)  
They play dirty, I already know the game, yeah  
I have my crew tight, ready in the truck (Ready in the truck)  
A corrido plays, I light up a joint, they do the same; they look like my shadow (Eh-yeh)  
What surprises them? It’s another corrido if they always mention me  
It’s not a secret, they know you’re just another in the crowd; suck it up, yeh (Suck it up)

**[Chorus]**  
Yeah, I went from thousands to hundred dollars (Eh-yeh)  
I don’t look for dealers, now it comes on its own (Yes-yes-yes-yes)  
And go tell them whose territory this is (Yeah, eh)  
Uh, pure quality, looks like Sinaloa (Uh!)

**[Verse 2]**  
Every day I'm ballin' (Every day)  
The cops always stop me (Cops)  
Now it’s the cone and not molly (Molly)  
The league breaks for money (Money)  
Every day I'm ballin' (Yeh)  
The cops always stop me (Yes)  
Now it’s the cone and not molly (Uh!)  
The league breaks for money (Yeh), yeah

**[Bridge]**  
Lift your spirits (Lift your spirits), turn it up (Turn it up), light it up (Light it up), quick (Quick)  
Level up (Level up), burn it (Burn it), it’s cool (It’s cool)  
Lift your spirits (Lift your spirits), turn it up (Turn it up), light it up (Light it up), quick (Quick)  
Level up (Level up), burn it (Burn it), it’s cool (It’s cool)

**[Chorus]**  
Yeah, I went from thousands to hundred dollars (Hundred dollars)  
I don’t look for dealers, now it comes on its own (Now it comes on its own)  
And go tell them whose territory this is (Whose is it?)  
Uh, pure quality, looks like Sinaloa (Looks like Sinaloa)  
Yeah, I went from thousands to hundred dollars (Hundred dollars)  
Yeah, I don’t look for dealers, now it comes on its own (Oh, comes on its own)  
Uh, go tell them whose territory this is (Oh-yeh)  
Yeh, pure quality, looks like Sinaloa (Yeah!)

**[Part II]**

**[Intro]**  
Yeh, uh!  
Yeh-eh

**[Verse 3]**  
I’ve already started, I’m not going to stop (Yeh-yeh)  
I don’t know what they’re doing, they won’t stop talking (Yeh-yeh)  
We keep rising, time passes and there’s no news  
No news (Yeh, yeh!)  
It’s the truth (Yes, uh!)  
Pure cash coming in (Uh, yeh-yeh!)  
I break it down well, I nail it like Carter in the NBA (Eh; rra)  
Check it out, read the numbers, cousin, so you see I’m not going to mess it up (No-no)  
Yeah, we have plenty of luxuries, kid, here you go, because we have enough to share, yeah (Uh!)  
Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, yeah (Uh, uh!)  
Look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, look at it, yeah (Yeah)  
The stones and designer cuts like [?] (-sa, yeah)  
They see me flashy always with my crew all over the city (Brum-brum-brum-brum)  
Living life little by little gave me seriousness (Gave me seriousness)  
Sure, it’s not the same if you know everything can end (Can end)  
I hustle whether it’s good or bad for me (Good or bad)  
I envy nothing from anyone, I don’t care (I don’t care)  
I always carry a lot of style, that’s normal (Yes, yes)  
Always
