**[Intro]**  
Yeah, yeah  

**[Verse 1]**  
Ten o'clock at night, and I step out as usual  
Diamonds shining bright, blinding when they catch the light  
I stand out from the crowd  
You might not be used to my style  
I don’t know if I should take the Mercedes or the Maserati  
Foreign models calling me "Daddy"  
They’re hitting me up, they want to see me (Ah)  
Surely, they’re already crazy to meet  
But I’m the one bringing the champagne  
If it’s not Moët, the blonde won’t bathe  
I’m off on a trip, and in two hours, they miss me  
Or better said, it’s the money that keeps me company  
I’m quite the king in the city of sun  
I don’t go shopping; I own the mall  
I’m Cristiano after scoring a goal  
Got French girls speaking Spanish to me  
And always decked out in Gucci, Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton  
I don’t wear Retro, but I have the whole collection  
For Khalifa Kush, I’ve got the connection  
Miami Beach is my address (Ah)  
Everything’s superficial, nothing real  
Nothing strange that money can’t buy  
Penthouse with an ocean view  
It’s the only thing I have to get by  

**[Chorus]**  
Another night in Miami (Yeah)  
Another night in Miami  
Another night in Miami  
Another night in Miami  
Another night without you  
Another night without you  

**[Verse 2]**  
Supposedly, I’ve forgotten you  
But it’s 11:34, and I thought of you (Yeah)  
I haven’t seen you since I moved  
But I dreamed of you last night and said hi  
Trying to heal the scars  
I’ve been with models and actresses  
Surely, I never really wanted them  
Honestly, I don’t even know why I did it  
And in the garage is the Bentley you wanted so much  
I hop in to smoke, imagining you’re driving  
I’m tired of threesomes and orgies  
I’m tired of my life feeling empty  
And I remember you used to say  
That if I didn’t change, I’d lose you  
How I wish I could go back to those days  
Now that I’m rich, I don’t have what I had  
Because my Rolex doesn’t shine like your smile  
And I don’t like sharing the warmth with these girls  
If you think of coming back, let me know  
While I keep going solo  

**[Chorus]**  
Another night in Miami (Yeah)  
Another night in Miami  
Another night in Miami  
Another night in Miami  
Another night without you  
Another night without you  
Another night without you (Another night without you)  
Another night without you (Another night without you, yeah)
