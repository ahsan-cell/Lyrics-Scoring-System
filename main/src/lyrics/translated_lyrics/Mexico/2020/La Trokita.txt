**Driving through the night in my little truck  
A beautiful lady is always by my side  
Burning rubber, they see me, enjoying life well**

**The envy doesn’t affect me, it’s always there  
I keep my circle tight for now  
With my buddies drinking, good vibes flowing**

**In the distance, I see caravans arriving  
Big trucks rolling in, some lowriders too  
With dark windows thumping corridos**

**Right now, I’m partying, pulling a band  
I’m always grateful to the one above  
They see me cruising through California  
Texas is my home where I went to settle down**

**Firm with the strong, they know not to back down  
Life has its twists, and you’ve got to know how to play  
I’m going all out, no brakes, taking off with a blunt**

**I learned from the streets, never went to school  
I preferred the cash, now we have plenty  
I spend it in a flash  
It comes back double to the bank**

**I carry a San Judas on my chest  
Always have my mother’s blessing  
I’m heading out, gonna burn some rubber  
In my truck, stepping on the gas**
