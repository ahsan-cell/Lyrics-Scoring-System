**[Verse 1]**  
Positive mind, oh, the things life brings  
If I talk about animals, I prefer the little gorilla  
I have someone to watch over me, and also someone who wants to kill me  
But I don’t hide, they know where to find me  
I like the girls, they’re the best part of life  
I like the blondes, and I also like the brunettes  
But they should be wild to really stir up the chaos  
Because if I pull out a gun, they’ll want to join in too  

**[Chorus]**  
Whether it’s death  
Or the money that’s chasing bills  
No more worries  
Good night  
A few bottles and let’s play some good tricks  
Things are getting wild  
We’re here feeling good, I won’t stop  
Dust, women, and friends, I love to roll  

**[Interlude]**  
And here we go, buddy, my friend  
All the way to Tijuana, old school, pure Junior H  

**[Verse 2]**  
Burning rubber, the little hill burns well  
The lights are on, a police officer is coming up behind  
I’m not a loudmouth nor do I like to show off  
Better not to stop, and if they catch me, I’ll pay the toll  
The one who’s bold and has guts in life  
Always has money and asks to help his family  
Always drives a nice car to pick up good girls  
And anyone who gets in the way, we’ll make their cap fly  

**[Chorus]**  
Whether it’s death  
Or the money that’s chasing bills  
No more worries  
Good night  
A few bottles and let’s play some good tricks  
Things are getting wild  
We’re here feeling good, I won’t stop  
Dust, women, and friends, I love to roll
