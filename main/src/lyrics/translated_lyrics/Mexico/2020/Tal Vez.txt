**Translated Lyrics:**

Let’s go up, there’s no rush  
I just want to feel your lips and have you be mine  
Getting lost right now isn’t a sin, girl  
Let’s forget everything, we need to enjoy ourselves right now  

And maybe we’ll fly into space  
Or maybe we won’t know where to stay  

Taking your hand, I feel it slow  
I can’t quite grasp it, we’re both lost, you know  
With you, I calm down, feeling good as we stroll  
Walking towards the moon, the night stretches on  

And maybe it’s true that it’s not coming in  
Or maybe we’re crazy and just dreaming  

I want to trip out with you, I want to be  
Forget the world filled with pure malice  
You give me good vibes, just like that  
Singing to the woman who fills my soul  

From this view, the city looks so fine  
Holding you close, you wrap yourself in my arms  
Your kisses dominate because they fascinate me  
Dancing slowly while the stars shine bright  

Maybe we’ll get lost for a while  
Or maybe you want to go somewhere more private  

We’ll head to a room, fill it with love  
Your body has me mesmerized right now  
We turn off the lights, close the door tight  
What we have, you and I, is more than just passion  

Maybe for you, I’d give the most precious thing  
Or maybe you don’t want anything, just my love  

I want to trip out with you, I want to be  
Forget the world filled with pure malice  
You give me good vibes, just like that  
Singing to the woman who fills my soul
