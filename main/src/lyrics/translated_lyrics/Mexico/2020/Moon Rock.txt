**Translated Lyrics:**

In the pipe, a little bit of Moon Rock  
With honey from bees  
To make it hit hard  
With that, I figure it’ll be enough  
Just in case it doesn’t hit strong, there’s the pipe to make it hit harder  
The dealer gives it to us two for one  
Because we’re the number one customers  
And the truth is  
It really gets wild with those green little buds  
And the joint  

The smoke is already lit, the white haze is on its way  
Getting high, the little trip begins  
Calm and with squinty eyes  
I like to feel good  
I’m living life to the fullest and more  
I enjoy the trip even more  

When  
I’m with friends, the fun is more entertaining  
Everything becomes more enjoyable  
And it’s just boring when I’m alone  
Light up another one to burn  
Because I don’t want to come down  
I’ll always stay up  

Here we sail nice and chill  
It’s pretty normal to have a stoner face  
And with the crew, we’re always in the vibe  
Rolling up the green, puffing smoke to clear the mind  
The little joint left me wanting more  
A sip of whiskey wouldn’t hurt  
And with my aunt Mary Jane, we’re careful, I don’t smoke anything basic  

And the joint is already lit, the white smoke is on its way  
Getting high, the little trip begins  
Calm with squinty eyes  
I like to feel good  
I’m living life to the fullest and more  
I enjoy the trip even more  

When  
I’m with friends, the fun is more entertaining  
Everything becomes more enjoyable  
And it’s just boring when I’m alone  
Light up another one to burn  
Because I don’t want to come down  
I’ll always stay up
