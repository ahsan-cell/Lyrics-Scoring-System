**Translated Lyrics:**

Move it  
Raise it  
Move it  
Raise it  

[Verse 1]  
Tico was a Puerto Rican from Manhattan  
Singing in the subway  
With his beatbox and electric guitar  
By night he was a DJ  
People would get up from their seats  
And he made the world spin  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What beautiful times  
When we danced until we dropped  
Jumping to the sky  
With that wildness of living  

[Chorus]  
We have to ask for  
More, more, more, from life  
Until the sun and the moon go out  
And it doesn’t matter  
More, more, more, what they say  
As if it were the last night of your days  

[Post-Chorus]  
Move it  
Move it, take it up high  
Raise it  
Raise it with adrenaline  
Enjoy it  
Enjoy what your body craves  
Move it  

[Verse 2]  
Martica was a girl from Miami  
Who always dreamed  
Of being a model and conquering New York  
Made up all day long  
Her heels were hurting  
And we crowned her queen of the show  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What beautiful times  
When we danced until we dropped  
Jumping to the sky  
With that wildness of living  

[Chorus]  
We have to ask for  
More, more, more, from life  
Until the sun and the moon go out  
And it doesn’t matter  
More, more, more, what they say  
As if it were the last night of your days  

[Post-Chorus]  
Move it  
Move it, take it up high  
Raise it  
Raise it with adrenaline  
Enjoy it  
Enjoy what your body craves  
Move it  

[Bridge]  
Move it  
Raise it  
Move it  
Raise it  
Uh-uh-uh  
Yeah!  

[Chorus]  
We have to ask for  
More, more, more, from life  
Until the sun and the moon go out  
And it doesn’t matter  
More, more, more, what they say  
As if it were the last night of your days  

[Post-Chorus]  
Move it  
Move it, take it up high  
Raise it  
Raise it with adrenaline  
Enjoy it  
Enjoy what your body craves  
Move it  

[Outro]  
Never stop  
Do what you feel  
Follow your destiny  
Off the beaten path
