**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I love you, you doubt it  
You're the most certain fool  
That I won’t leave you  
I’m going to paint a blanket  
Where it says there’s nothing  
That can make me suffer  

[Verse 2]  
With my lips frozen  
From your kisses so cold  
It’s snowing pain  
There’s winter in this story  
To be honest, it’s not glorious  
And that’s why I’m leaving  

[Chorus]  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Loving you, wanting you  
Loving you, wanting you, I’m leaving, leaving you  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Knowing that no one ever loved you like I did  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
Knowing that no one ever loved you like I did  

[Verse 3]  
I’m saying goodbye to your life  
But never regretting  
Because I gave my all  
Even though I know on your part  
There are lies so cowardly  
And that’s why I’m leaving  

[Chorus]  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Loving you, wanting you  
Loving you, wanting you, I’m leaving, leaving you  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Knowing that no one ever loved you like I did  

[Chorus]  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Loving you, wanting you  
Loving you, wanting you, I’m leaving, leaving you  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Knowing that no one ever loved you like I did  

[Bridge]  
Na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na  
And I’m leaving  

[Chorus]  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Loving you, wanting you  
Loving you, wanting you, I’m leaving, leaving you  
And I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
Knowing that no one ever loved you like I did  
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na  
Knowing that no one ever loved you like I did  

[End]  
Like I did
