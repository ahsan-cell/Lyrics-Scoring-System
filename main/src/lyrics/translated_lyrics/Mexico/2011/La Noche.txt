**Translated Lyrics:**

Camouflage of a woman  
I’ll hide the one who behaves so well  
A passionate mask  
And now it’s time to misbehave  

I let the wind mess up my hair  
I speed up, going without brakes  
Through the streets of the city  

The night  
Sometimes loves me, other times it forgets me  
But it’s worth the risk for those moments  
That I later can’t remember  

And the night  
Has its corners for lovers  
Where some rascals get confused  
If they chase me, I let myself be caught  

Then I escape, speed up  
Going without brakes through the streets of the city  

Once again, I’ll play at living without a tomorrow  
To feel, without fear  
Of what they say about me  
Daring to seek  
The beginning or the end  

Against time, I fly  
I speed up, going without brakes  
Through the streets of the city  

The night  
Sometimes loves me, other times it forgets me  
But it’s worth the risk for those moments  
That I later can’t remember  

And the night  
Has its corners for lovers  
Where some rascals get confused  
If they chase me, I let myself be caught  

Then I escape, speed up  
Going without brakes through the streets of the city  

Because among the shadows  
Looking at the stars, I am one of them  
Jumping like a leopard in a spotted cat  
The sun will break our spell  

The night  
Sometimes loves me, other times it forgets me  
But it’s worth the risk for those moments  
That I later can’t remember  
And the night  
Has its corners for lovers  
Where some rascals get confused  
If they chase me, I let myself be caught  

Then I escape, speed up  
Going without brakes through the streets of the city  
Through the city, through the city
