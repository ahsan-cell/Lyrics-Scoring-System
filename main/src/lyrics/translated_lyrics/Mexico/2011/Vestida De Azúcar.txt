**[Verse 1]**  
I'm so afraid  
That you'll forget how much I love you  
And that, as time goes by,  
You'll leave it all in the past  
I'm so very scared  
You're almost gone and I still can't dare  
So much caution that desire doesn't come near  
Protecting myself from getting hurt, I end up with nothing  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've planned in my mind  
How to steal your kisses forever  
It has to work out  
I'm going to love you so much that suddenly you'll find yourself crying  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm going to give you what I've never given anyone  
Dressed in sugar, a sweet treat for you  
I'll melt you in the warmth of my voice  
I'll take your breath away and you won't say goodbye  
I'm going to do what I've never done for anyone  
No matter what you think, I'll take the risk  
And even though I know I'm likely to lose, I'd rather leap into the unknown  
In a moment lived, I'll either die... or succeed  

**[Verse 2]**  
I won't be cautious anymore  
After all, if you leave, just leave me a smile  
The memory might hurt  
But I'd prefer that to not having even that  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've planned in my mind  
The perfect act to keep you here  
I'm going to conquer my fear  
Now you'll feel what I can cause when I want  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm going to give you what I've never given anyone  
Dressed in sugar, a sweet treat for you  
I'll melt you in the warmth of my voice  
I'll take your breath away and you won't say goodbye  
I'm going to do what I've never done for anyone  
No matter what you think, I'll take the risk  
And even though I know I'm likely to lose, I'd rather leap into the unknown  
In a moment lived, I'll either die... or succeed  

**[Bridge]**  
Sugar crystals reflect the moon  
Tears of relief show you paths  
One step closer, the frost breaks  
I don't tremble with fear but... with how much I love you  
(Aah-aah, aah, aah)  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm going to give you what I've never given anyone  
Dressed in sugar, a sweet treat for you  
I'll melt you in the warmth of my voice  
I'll take your breath away and you won't say goodbye  
I'm going to do what I've never done for anyone  
No matter what you think, I'll take the risk  
And even though I know I'm likely to lose  
I'd rather leap into the unknown  
In a moment lived, I'll either die... or succeed  

**[Outro]**  
I'll succeed
