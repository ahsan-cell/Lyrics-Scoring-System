**Translated Lyrics:**

How is it possible? It happened right before my eyes  
And now, where are the (...)  

It's time to find you  
And tell you once more that we are wind and we are air  
And the dreams that fade away  
I just want to imagine you just one more time  
For everything else slips away like the years that have passed  

In this moment where there is no tomorrow and no yesterday  
I want to hold you, I want to tell you what I know  
And now...  

It's time to find you  
And tell you once more that we are wind and we are air  
And the dreams that fade away  
I just want to imagine you just one more time  
For everything else slips away like the years that have passed  

It's time to find you  
And tell you once more that we are wind and we are air  
And the dreams that fade away  
I just want to imagine you just one more time  
For everything else slips away like the years that have passed  

In an instant, I found myself trying to see again  
All the years that have gone  
In an instant, I found myself trying to see again  
All the years that have gone
