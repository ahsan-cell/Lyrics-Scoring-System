**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Anahí, Bryan Amadeus]  
I take photographs to post  
Photographs for my profile  
And I edit them to look my best  
Blessed is the man who invented Photoshop  

[Pre-Chorus: Bryan Amadeus, Anahí]  
And without my camera, I can't go out  
The paparazzi are chasing after me  

[Chorus: Bryan Amadeus, Anahí & Ale Sergi, Ale Sergi]  
And they click (Click, click)  
On me (Click, click)  
And nothing looks like what I saw  
And now that my life is a never-ending dream  
It's obvious I should say yes, yes  

[Verse 2: Ale Sergi, Anahí]  
I know people who never stop talking  
All night long, anything can happen  
They tell me things I can't understand  
But I imagine what they want to do  

[Pre-Chorus: Bryan Amadeus, Anahí]  
What do you think if we leave this place?  
Give me two seconds, I’m going to the bathroom to powder my nose  

[Chorus: Bryan Amadeus, Anahí & Ale Sergi, Ale Sergi]  
And they click (Click, click)  
On me (Click, click)  
And nothing looks like what I saw  
And now that my life is a never-ending dream  
It's obvious I should say yes (Click, click)  
On me (Click, click)  
And nothing looks like what I saw  
And now that my life is a never-ending dream  
It's obvious I should say yes  

[Bridge: Bryan Amadeus, Anahí & Ale Sergi]  
Red shoes, obviously high heels  
The taller I am, the louder the applause  
Everyone is fighting to get into the VIP, yes  
Make way for me, get out of the way!  

[Chorus: Bryan Amadeus, Anahí & Ale Sergi, Ale Sergi, Bryan Amadeus]  
And they click  
On me  
And nothing looks like what I saw  
And now that my life is a never-ending dream  
It's obvious I should say yes, yes  
And they click (Click, click)  
On me (On me)  
And nothing looks like what I saw  
And now that my life is a never-ending dream  
It's obvious I should say yes  
And they click  
On me (On me)  
And nothing looks like what I saw  
And now that my life is a never-ending dream  
It's obvious I should say yes, yes
