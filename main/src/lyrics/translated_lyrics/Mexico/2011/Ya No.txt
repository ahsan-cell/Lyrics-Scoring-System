**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I already know everything, and you can leave now  
This is too much, and I can't forgive you  
Go with her or whoever, I don't care  
But don't come back here anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Verse 2]  
And if you call me, I won't be available  
And if you write to me, don't expect a reply  
And all your gifts, I’ll return them to you  
Because I want nothing from you  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Chorus]  
Here, there will be no heart  
To give you its love  
At any time you want  
You won't have my passion anymore  
Say goodbye to the warmth  
That I once gave you  
You can go now  
There's nothing more to discuss  
I don't love you anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Verse 3]  
And my friends told me  
That your affection would never be sincere  
Well, today I believe it, seeing you in her arms  
And I don’t want to see you anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Verse 4]  
And these lips will no longer be yours  
My love will only be a blow to your pride  
And if you hug me, it will only be in dreams  
Because I don’t want you here anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Chorus]  
Here, there will be no heart  
To give you its love  
At any time you want  
You won't have my passion anymore  
Say goodbye to the warmth  
That I once gave you  
You can go now  
There's nothing more to discuss  
I don't love you anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

Here, there will be no heart  
To give you its love  
At any time you want  
You won't have my passion anymore  
Say goodbye to the warmth  
That I once gave you  
You can go now  
There's nothing more to discuss  
I don't love you anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Post-Chorus]  
Not anymore, not anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Interlude]  
There's nothing more to discuss  
I don't love you anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Chorus]  
Here, there will be no heart  
To give you its love  
At any time you want  
You won't have my passion anymore  
Say goodbye to the warmth  
That I once gave you  
You can go now  
There's nothing more to discuss  
I don't love you anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  

[Outro]  
Not anymore, not anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore  
Not anymore, not anymore
