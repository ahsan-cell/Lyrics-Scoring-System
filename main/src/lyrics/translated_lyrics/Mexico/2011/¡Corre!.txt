**[Verse 1]**  
You look at me differently  
You hug me, but I don’t feel your warmth  
I tell you how I feel  
You interrupt me and finish my sentence  
You’re always right  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You, the same old script, so predictable  
Yeah, I already know it  

**[Chorus]**  
So run, run, run, my heart  
Of the two of us, you were always the fastest  
Take everything you want, but just go now  
Because I’ll never give you my tears  
So run like always, don’t look back  
You’ve done it before, and honestly, I don’t care  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’ve lived this scene, and with much sorrow, I say no  
Not with me  
I gave what I could, but it was left half-open  
My heart  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You, the same old script, so repetitive  
No, it doesn’t suit you anymore  

**[Chorus]**  
So run, run, run, my heart  
Of the two of us, you were always the fastest  
Take everything you want, but just go now  
Because I’ll never give you my tears  
So run like always, don’t look back  
You’ve done it before, and honestly, I don’t care  

**[Instrumental Interlude]**  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You, the same old dog, the same tricks  
Yeah, I already know them  

**[Chorus]**  
So run, run, run, my heart  
Of the two of us, you were always the fastest  
Take everything you want, but just go now  
Because I’ll never give you my tears  
There have been so many goodbyes that truly  
To dedicate you one more verse is unnecessary  
So run like always, I won’t chase after you  
You’ve done it before, and honestly, I don’t care  
You’ve done it before, and honestly, I don’t care  
You’ve done it before, but in the end, I don’t care
