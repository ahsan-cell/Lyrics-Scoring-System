**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Butterflies inside my body  
Everything is movement  
I am movement  
Look how the universe spins  
That's what I feel  
That's what I feel  

[Chorus]  
No, I won't stop  
I won't stop  
Not today, no  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I, will fly over your skin  
I don't know where I'll end up  

[Chorus]  
I'm not afraid to explore  
No matter what may happen  
I just want to sail a dream  
I'm not afraid to explore  
No matter what may happen  
I just want to sail with you  

[Verse 2]  
Asteroids inside my body  
Everything is movement, I am movement  
The world spins inside my body  
That's what I feel, that's what I feel  

[Chorus]  
No, I won't stop  
I won't stop  
Not today, no  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I, will fly over your skin  
I don't know where I'll end up  

[Chorus]  
I'm not afraid to explore  
No matter what may happen  
I just want to sail a dream  
I'm not afraid to explore  
No matter what may happen  
I just want to sail with you
