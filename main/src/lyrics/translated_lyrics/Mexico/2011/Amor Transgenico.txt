**Translated Lyrics:**

Mystery of black scissors  
That cut our transgenic love  
Like a chimera  
And who forbids me arsenic?  
If your lips create it, that’s my choice  
Dark temptation, nothing else matters  
Just you and me  
The law of others is irrelevant  
With you, everything is eternity  

**[Chorus]**  
My love, I only want you  
My love, without you I can't live  
Oh, oh, oh  

**[Verse 2]**  
I know what we have is forbidden  
And if they want to judge us, I don’t care about society  
I want to truly live  
And I see no other life if you’re not here  
Without you, my love, I have nothing  
I love you and fill you with kisses  
I’m waiting just for you  
Can’t you see I’m dying for you?  

**[Chorus]**  
My love, I only want you  
My love, without you I can't live  

**[Bridge]**  
I don’t want to stay if they won’t let me love you  
I want to go to Mars if they won’t let me love you  

**[Chorus]**  
My love, I only want you  
My love, without you I can't live  
My love, I only want you  
My love, without you I can't live
