**Translated Lyrics:**

I am transparent  
You can smell me very well  
Since I present myself  
I don’t need to speak to make myself understood  

[Verse 2]  
My eyes tell you everything  
My mouth hums what I think  
You’ll know what I feel  
Just by touching my skin  

[Verse 3]  
I don’t bite, nor caress  
I just hibernate all the time  
In my pillow cage  
Where no one knows the truth  

[Chorus] [x2]  
I have no voice to say it  
That’s why I come and write it to you  
I have dishonored my principles (Once again)  

[Instrumental Bridge]  

[Chorus]  
I have no voice to say it  
That’s why I come and write it to you  
I have dishonored my principles  

[Hook]  
A-ah, a-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah [x3]  
A-ah, a-ah, ah-ah  

[Bridge]  
I’ve never had the fury of a lion  
Always taking the shortcut  
Like he taught me  

[Chorus]  
I have no voice to say it  
That’s why I come and write it to you  
I have dishonored my principles  
Like he taught me  

[Conclusion]  
He taught me [x2]
