**Translated Lyrics:**

O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  

[Verse 1]  
I like you so much that I only think of you  
I see you passing by and don’t know what to say  
I wish you knew how I feel about you  
I would give anything for you to be just for me  

[Verse 2]  
I still don’t know what it was that enchanted me about you  
I never thought Cupid would strike me like this  
Just once, you stood in front of me  
And I fell in love the moment I saw you  

[Verse 3]  
It’s what I feel when I’m close to you  
It’s something chemical that takes over me  
Maybe it’s your looks that hypnotized me  
It’s ironic that I can’t tell you how much I like you  

[Chorus]  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  
So much, oh, oh  
That I like you so much, oh, oh  
Baby, that I like you so much, oh, oh  
Oh, that I like you so much, oh, oh  

[Verse 4]  
I like you so much, I want to be for you  
I see you dancing, I want you in front of me  
I wish you knew how I feel about you  
I dream that your kisses were for me  

[Verse 5]  
I already know, you like me and I like you too  
Just like I know you must be crazy for me  
Time and again, I keep thinking of you  
Seeing you again is what I long for endlessly  

[Verse 6]  
It’s what I feel when I’m close to you  
It’s something chemical that takes over me  
Maybe it’s your looks that hypnotized me  
It’s ironic that I can’t tell you how much I like you  

[Chorus]  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  
So much, oh, oh  
That I like you so much, oh, oh  
Baby, that I like you so much, oh, oh  
Oh, that I like you so much, oh, oh  

[Bridge]  
I don’t know how to tell you that I adore you, that I’m in love with you  
Like chocolate, you melt me, but now the time has come  
For you to get close to me and let’s end up dancing, sweating, oh, oh, oh  
I haven’t been able to say it, but I’m trying  
I don’t know what’s happening to me  

[Chorus]  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much, my love  
O-eh, o-eh, eh, oh  
I like you so much  
So much, oh, oh  
That I like you so much, oh, oh  
Baby, that I like you so much, oh, oh  
Oh, that I like you so much, oh, oh
