**[Verse 1]**  
You opened a window, awakening an illusion  
Completely blinding my reason  
I held onto hope, knowing your inner self  
Feeling your warmth so foreign to me  
I tasted the apple for love  

**[Chorus]**  
I want to stop loving you and bury this pain  
I want my heart to forget you  
I want to be like you, I want to be the strong one  
I’ve only asked in return for your sincerity  
I want love to finally answer  
Why am I always the one with bad luck?  

**[Verse 2]**  
You come, you caress me, and leave with the sun  
It hurts to just be your amusement  
You say you love me, that there’s no one like me  
That I’m the owner of your heart  
But someone else is in your room  

**[Chorus]**  
I want to stop loving you and bury this pain  
I want my heart to forget you  
I want to be like you, I want to be the strong one  
I’ve only asked in return for your sincerity  
I want love to finally answer  
Why am I always the one with bad luck?  

**[Bridge]**  
No, it’s okay if love isn’t perfect  
As long as it’s honest  
And no, why ask for forgiveness, it’s not right  
I can’t share what was never given to me  
I’m not the owner of your heart  
I’m the one who doesn’t belong in this room  

**[Chorus]**  
I want to stop loving you and bury this pain  
I want my heart to forget you  
I want to be like you, I want to be the strong one  
I’ve only asked in return for your sincerity  
I want love to finally answer  
Why am I always the one with bad luck?
