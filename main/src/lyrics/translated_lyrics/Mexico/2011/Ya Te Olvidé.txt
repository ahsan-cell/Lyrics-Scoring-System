**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I've already forgotten you  
I'm free once again  
I fly back to my life  
That is far away and forbidden for you  

I've already forgotten you  
You're now too far from me  
You succeeded in hurting me, wounding me  
And turning me into who knows what  

[Chorus]  
You trapped me, you had me in your hands  
You showed me the inhumane and how unhappy you can be  
You pretended to be truly in love  
Even though you've never loved me, I know it  

You told me I could never forget you  
That later I would beg you and ask you: "Kiss me"  
I fought against the love I had for you, and it left  
And now, I've already forgotten you  

[Verse 2]  
I've already forgotten you  
You're now too far from me  
You succeeded in hurting me and wounding me  
And turning me into who knows what  

[Chorus]  
You trapped me, you had me in your hands  
You showed me the inhumane and how unhappy you can be  
You pretended to be truly in love  
Even though you've never loved me, I know it  

You told me I could never forget you  
That later I would beg you and ask you: "Kiss me"  
I fought against the love I had for you, and it left  
And now, I've already forgotten you  

[Instrumental]  

[Chorus]  
You pretended to be truly in love  
Even though you've never loved me, I know it  

You told me I could never forget you  
That later I would beg you and ask you: "Kiss me"  
I fought against the love I had for you, and it left  
And now, I've already forgotten you  
And now, I've already forgotten you
