**Translated Lyrics:**

And I had to learn how to live without you  
Every single second  
I went out walking in the cold, sometimes  
To learn how to fly, you have to jump  
Into the void  

And I learned so much about who I want to be  
Not a day went by that I didn’t think of you  
I never stopped searching for a way back  
And I’ve finally made it  

I’m with you again  
I understand which way to go  
I smile and I can believe it’s possible  
When you and I are together  
And now that we’re here  
Everything has become so clear  
I confess that being far away taught me  
That I want to be by your side  

The best day of my life has returned  
It wasn’t hard because I know you always  
Leave a light on  
I came back and you were already waiting  
I took your hand and you softly said  
Why did you take so long?  

And I learned so much about who I want to be  
Not a day went by that I didn’t think of you  
I never stopped searching for a way back  
And I’ve finally made it  

I’m with you again  
I understand which way to go  
I smile and I can believe it’s possible  
When you and I are together  

And now that we’re here  
Everything has become so clear  
I confess that being far away taught me  
That I want to be by your side  

I’m with you again  
I understand which way to go  
I smile and I can believe it’s possible  
When you and I are together  

And now that we’re here  
Everything has become so clear  
I confess that being far away taught me  
That I want to be by your side...
