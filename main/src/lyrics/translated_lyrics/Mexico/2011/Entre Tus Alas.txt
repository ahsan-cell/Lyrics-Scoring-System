**Translated Lyrics:**

Slave to freedom  
One of those who knows how to float  
And kisses the sky  

And until  
You appeared around here  
I decided to land  
And stay on your ground  

I discovered my faith in your illusion  
My soul recognized  
Your voice  
And so  
My heart followed you  

**[Chorus]**  
I fly between your wings  
I awaken in your calm  
And my peace (and my peace)  
And my reason  

I travel in your gaze  
You lift me up  
I’m better than I was  
Because of you, Love  

**[Verse 2]**  
And until today  
I thought that freedom  
Was somewhere else  
And now I carry it within  

I peeked  
Into the labyrinth of your love  
Here I found my truth  
And in you is what I want  

I discovered my faith in your illusion  
My soul recognized  
Your voice  
And so  
My heart followed you  

**[Chorus]**  
I fly between your wings  
I awaken in your calm  
And my peace (and my peace)  
And my reason  

I travel in your gaze  
You lift me up  
I’m better than I was  
Because of you, Love  
I travel in your gaze  
You lift me up  
I’m better than I was  
Because of you, Love  

I’ve always been a slave to Freedom  
With you, I can touch  
What I dreamed of  
For so long
