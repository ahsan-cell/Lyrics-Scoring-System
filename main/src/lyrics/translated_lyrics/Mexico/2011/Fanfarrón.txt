**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Comparisons are hateful  
But I have a thousand reasons  
To know it was a mistake  
I weigh what I have on the scale  
And I hold myself back  
From singing them to you, my love  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You swore me wonders (No, no, no)  
That you would even cure my ills (Yes, sir)  
I’ve entrusted and confessed  
I’ve even prayed the rosary  
To the little Virgin of love  

[Chorus]  
But I, I convinced myself  
That it’s better to be alone  
Than deceived by you  
I will cry, I know it’s true  
But rest assured  
I’m stronger without you  
I’m stronger without you  
Ti-ti-ti-ti-ri-ri-ti-ti-ri-ri  
Ti-ti-ti-ti-ri-ri-ti-ti-ri-ri  

[Verse 2]  
I decided to clean out the closet  
To give away the unnecessary  
Starting with your love  
I pledged my soul to love you  
And it turns out my luck  
Is that it was for the best  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let him not dare to claim me (No, no, no)  
Saying now he knows how to love me (Braggart)  
So many promises to the saints  
That as they know, there were so many  
But none fulfilled them  

[Chorus]  
That’s why I, I convinced myself  
That it’s better to be alone  
Than deceived by you  
I will cry, I know it’s true  
But rest assured  
I’m stronger without you  

That’s why I, I convinced myself  
That it’s better to be alone  
Than deceived by you  
I will cry, I know it’s true  
But rest assured  
I’m stronger without you  
I’m stronger without you  

[Bridge]  
You swore me wonders (No, no, no)  
That you would even cure my ills (Yes, sir)  
Let him not dare to claim me (No, no, no)  
Saying now he knows how to love me (Braggart)  

[Chorus]  
That’s why I, I convinced myself  
That it’s better to be alone  
Than deceived by you  
I will cry, I know it’s true  
But rest assured  
I’m stronger without you  
I’m stronger without you (I’m stronger without you)  
I’m stronger without you (I’m stronger without you)  
I’m stronger without you
