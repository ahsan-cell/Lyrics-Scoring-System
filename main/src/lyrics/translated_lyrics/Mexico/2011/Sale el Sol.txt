**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
These weeks without seeing you  
Felt like years to me  
I wanted to kiss you so much  
That my lips ache  
Look, fear made us  
Do foolish things  
It left us deaf and blind  
So many times  

[Chorus]  
And one day after the storm  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  
From adding so much, you lose count  
Because one and one don’t always make two  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  

[Verse 2]  
I cried for you to the limit  
Of what was possible  
When I thought I was  
Invincible  
No evil lasts a hundred years  
Nor can any body endure it  
And the best always waits  
Ahead  

[Chorus]  
And one day after the storm  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  
From adding so much, you lose count  
Because one and one don’t always make two  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  
And one day after the storm  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  
From adding so much, you lose count  
Because one and one don’t always make two  
And one day after, and one day after  

[Bridge]  
The sun comes out  

[Chorus]  
And one day after the storm  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out  
From adding so much, you lose count  
Because one and one don’t always make two  
When you least expect it, the sun comes out
