**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m dying without you  
Since you ran away  
I spend my days crying endlessly  

And you think that I  
Can’t go on  
That I’m depressed  
Since you’ve been gone  

But I’m out here dancing  
Singing, achieving so much without you  
And you’re imagining  
That I spend my sleepless nights  
Dying for you  

But I’m out here dancing  
Loving my life now without you  
And when I remember your name  
And your kisses, I laugh at you  

Let me tell you, I’m better this way  
When you left  
You lost the only good thing about you  
No one else gave you  
What I gave to you  
And now your life is empty without me  

But I’m out here dancing  
Singing, achieving so much without you  
And you’re imagining  
That I spend my sleepless nights  
Dying for you  

But I’m out here dancing  
Loving my whole life now without you  
And when I remember your name  
And your kisses, I laugh at you  

And you swear that I’m so unhappy  
That only your hands filled my space  
That I wouldn’t find anyone else for me  

But I’m out here dancing  
Singing, achieving so much without you  
And you’re imagining  
That I spend my sleepless nights  
Dying for you  

But I’m out here dancing  
Loving my whole life without you  
And when I remember your name  
And your kisses, I laugh at you  

I’m out here dancing  
Singing, enjoying without you  
And you’re imagining  
That I spend my sleepless nights  
Dying for you  

But I’m out here dancing  
Loving my freedom now without you  
And when I remember your name  
And your kisses, I laugh at you.
