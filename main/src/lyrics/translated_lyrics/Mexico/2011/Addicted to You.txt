**[Verse 1]**  
It must be the perfume you wear  
Or the water with which you bathe  
But everything you do  
Feels like an achievement to me  
You kissed me that night  
As if it were the last day of your lips  
Every time I remember  
I feel in my chest the weight of a rock  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It's your brown eyes  
That greenish hue  
It's your boyish face  
And that nervous laugh  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm addicted to you  
Because your skin is a vice  
Baby, I'm addicted to you  
I want you to let yourself be loved  
I'm addicted to you  
Because your skin is a vice  
Baby, I'm addicted to you  
I want you to let yourself be loved  

**[Verse 2]**  
For the pure pleasure of floating  
Now I've been swept away by the current  
I can’t sleep or eat anymore  
Like decent people do  
A memory has lingered  
Just like a brooch pinned to my pillow  
And you, on the other hand, with your fish-like memory  
Don’t remember anything at all  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
It's your manly hands  
The scent of your back  
What has no name  
Your gaze made it happen  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm addicted to you  
Because your skin is a vice  
Baby, I'm addicted to you  
I want you to let yourself be loved  
I'm addicted to you  
Because your skin is a vice  
Baby, I'm addicted to you  
I want you to let yourself be loved
