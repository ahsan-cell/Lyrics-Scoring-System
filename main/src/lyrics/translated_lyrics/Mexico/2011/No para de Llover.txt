**Translated Lyrics:**

You can't speak with your heart  
Now I see, how is it so easy for you?  
It can only be because you’re not me  
Like a story without an end  
The days keep passing by  
I feel the drops, my sky falling, without understanding  
It doesn’t stop raining  
I can smell the damp guilt on your skin, without understanding  
In me, it doesn’t stop raining  

I know someone is waiting for you now  
You closed the curtain before the show began  
Like a story without an end  
The days keep passing by  
I feel the drops, my sky falling, without understanding  
It doesn’t stop raining  
I can smell the damp guilt on your skin, without understanding  
In me, it doesn’t stop raining  

I feel the drops, my sky falling, without understanding  
It doesn’t stop raining  
I can smell the damp guilt on your skin, without understanding  
In me, it doesn’t stop raining  

It doesn’t stop raining.
