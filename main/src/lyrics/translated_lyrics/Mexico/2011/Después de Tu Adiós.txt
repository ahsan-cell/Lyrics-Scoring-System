**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I kept your letters, a gray photo  
Your torn jeans and the last kiss  
To keep on living  
I think about forgetting you, but I'm lying  
Just one song is enough to bring me back again  
Behind you  
Behind you  
Behind you  

[Chorus]  
After your goodbye  
Nothing remains on my heart  
I bet my life to win your love  
And I've lost everything  
After your goodbye  
After your goodbye  
After your goodbye  

[Verse 2]  
I barely imagine you, and you make me cry  
And you still dwell in my feelings  
To keep on living  
Even though you've gone, I create you myself  
I turn off the light, and my memories take flight  
Behind you  
Behind you  
Behind you  

[Chorus]  
After your goodbye  
Nothing remains on my heart  
I bet my life to win your love  
And I've lost everything  
After your goodbye  
After your goodbye  
After your goodbye  

[Outro]  
Nothing remains on my heart  
Everything is lost  
After your goodbye  
After your goodbye
