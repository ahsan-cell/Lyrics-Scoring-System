**Translated Lyrics:**

Every girl wants to be her  
Oh, she’s divine!  
I feel it, I want to meet her  
They say - You’re too free  
Those are just rumors, I don’t believe them  
They say you need to settle down  
You’re bad in this town  
She’s like the other girls  
But there’s no one like the village queen  
I’m searching for words to describe her  
Without losing my reputation  
When her curves move, I can’t help it  
Enough staring, I pull her closer  
I’m searching for words to describe her  
Without losing my reputation  

Damn girl  
Hell, you sexy slut  
You sexy slut  
Hell, you sexy slut  
Damn girl  
Hell, you sexy slut  
You sexy slut  
Hell, you sexy slut  
Damn girl  

Yes, I see her  
Every girl wants to be her  
Oh, she’s divine!  
I feel it, I want to meet her  

They say - You’re too free  
Those are just rumors, I don’t believe them  
They say you need to settle down  
You’re bad in this town  
She’s like the other girls  
But there’s no one like the village queen  
I’m searching for words to describe her  
Without losing my reputation  
When her curves move, I can’t help it  
Enough staring, I pull her closer  
I’m searching for words to describe her  
Without losing my reputation  

Damn girl  
Hell, you sexy slut  
You sexy slut  
Hell, you sexy slut  
Damn girl  
Hell, you sexy slut  
You sexy slut  
Hell, you sexy slut  
Damn girl  
Hell, you sexy slut  
You sexy slut  
Hell, you sexy slut  
Damn girl  
Hell, you sexy slut  
You sexy slut  
Hell, you sexy slut  
Damn girl
