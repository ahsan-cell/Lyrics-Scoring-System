**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m honored to be with you, and I say the whole world envies me for having you  
Even the kindness within you shines through your eyes  
Your status is so high in my life, thanks to my good fortune  
Your companionship means everything to me; I can’t be away from you for a second  
May God keep you safe  

**[Verse 1]**  
Among my people, I’m treated with utmost respect  
And a noble person has a place among us, even if they’re absent  
We embody manhood, manners, and respect  
There’s a million books written on our brotherhood  
We only share bread and salt with the genuine  
If someone faces hardship, they lean on their brother  
Our words are united, raised in honesty  
In any place, we’re known without needing proof  

**[Verse 2]**  
People of honor, chivalry, and generosity  
My son, my father, my brother, my respected friend  
My family and loved ones who hold their place  
Their names are more famous than fire in the world  
The people in my heart are a group, my friend, and you’re another  
If I lived my whole life thanking you, it wouldn’t be enough  
A lifetime of gratitude wouldn’t suffice  
You grow in my eyes day by day, my friend  

**[Chorus]**  
You are genuine and perfect people  
Men of honor, not just words  
Sweet companionship and even sweeter friendship  
A hundred greetings and a hundred salutes  
You are my support in tough times  
You are my friends and family  
No matter how much I say  
You are the most precious thing to me  

**[Verse 3]**  
My family, my loved ones, and my people who bring me pride  
If I’m away from you, I feel my soul drifting away  
Between us, there’s companionship, shared bread and salt, and sweet words  
If I ever drift away, believe me, it’s beyond my control  
You who have roots and honor, it’s in your nature  
In any place, you’re recognized, it shows in you  
Always racing towards goodness, your status is high  
One hand always together, may your hands be blessed  

**[Chorus]**  
You are genuine and perfect people  
Men of honor, not just words  
Sweet companionship and even sweeter friendship  
A hundred greetings and a hundred salutes  
You are my support in tough times  
You are my friends and family  
No matter how much I say  
You are the most precious thing to me
