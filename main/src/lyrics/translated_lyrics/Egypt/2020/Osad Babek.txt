**Translated Lyrics:**

You’ve gone further down the road than the dream I once dreamed,  
It’s true that when we lose something, we understand its worth in time.  
I stayed scared and alone, my pain stretching out before me,  
Like a child in your hands, you let him wander lost in fear.  
I pass by memories with my eyes, as if I’m barefoot on glass,  
And still, every time I imagine, I see you holding my shoulders.  
I’ll walk alone in the street, feeling your ghost on the storefronts,  
You left me, and the night turned against me, leaving me with my sad song.

**[Chorus]**  
And the night that I now live alone,  
Is different from the night I once spent at your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the world's arms over your absence.  
And the night that I now live alone,  
Is different from the night I once spent at your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the world's arms over your absence.

**[Verse 2]**  
I close my eyes and imagine a time we’ll live again far away,  
And we’ll have grown, you and I, and our dimples will be wrinkles.  
The night stretches long, and I yearn for the embrace of old and your sighs,  
And I’m afraid if my life passes, I won’t die with my head on your hand.  
Still, I go everywhere and order two coffees as well,  
How can my heart live while your ghost still chases it?  
I’ve become broken, and I won’t deny it, my love, my land, my country,  
There are men in this world who break easily from separation.

**[Chorus]**  
And the night that I now live alone,  
Is different from the night I once spent at your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the world's arms over your absence.  
And the night that I now live alone,  
Is different from the night I once spent at your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the world's arms over your absence.
