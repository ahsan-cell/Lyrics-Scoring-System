**Translated Lyrics:**

He came gently, healed an old wound and renewed my spirit  
It slipped away from me, his gaze took me against my will, oh wow  
He left a mark deep in my heart, a trace that remains  
The smile in his eyes and the shape of his lips, I see the sweetness  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, the gentleman  
He’s in another place for me  
Stuck inside my heart  
And in my heart, he has a special place  
Oh, the gentleman  
He’s in another place for me  
Stuck inside my heart  
And in my heart, he has a special place  

**[After the Chorus]**  
Who is it that made a connection between him and others?  
He’s like a diamond while they’re just copper  
Sensitive and with a sweet spirit  
Like a song and a dance  
Oh wow  

**[Verse 2]**  
I can’t forget every word, whisper, touch  
My heart is inside, and he’s the one I love, beside him I feel strong  
He came gently, healed, healed, healed, healed  
He left a mark, a mark, left a mark  
Who is it that made, that made, made, made  
He’s like a diamond while they’re just copper  
They’re just copper  

**[Verse 3]**  
I’ve seen a lot, little, but I haven’t seen anyone so beautiful and heavy (like this)  
A master, an artist, a doctor, a school, art and engineering, what’s all this?  
He’s my secret, my mood, but serious and not just talk (ah)  
He captivated me, obsessed me, tired me, my longings swing me (oh)  
My longings swing me (oh)  
My longings swing me  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, the gentleman  
He’s in another place for me  
Stuck inside my heart  
And in my heart, he has a special place  
Oh, the gentleman  
He’s in another place for me  
Stuck inside my heart  
And in my heart, he has a special place  

**[Verse 1]**  
He came gently, healed an old wound and renewed my spirit  
It slipped away from me, his gaze took me against my will, oh wow  
He left a mark deep in my heart, a trace that remains  
The smile in his eyes and the shape of his lips, I see the sweetness (oh wow)  

**[Ending]**  
Oh wow
