**Translated Lyrics:**

In every place, eyes are watching around him,  
And oh my, as soon as he appears, everyone rushes to him.  
In every place, eyes are watching around him,  
And oh my, as soon as he appears, everyone rushes to him.  
This is a message revealed from the title, read what's written in his eyes.

**[Chorus]**  
In the nightlife spots, my moon has risen and become famous,  
And people get anxious when he shows up, overshadowing the beautiful ones.  
When he walks by the sea, the waves calm down and shy away,  
Everyone gets upset if he leaves; he has millions of admirers.  
In the nightlife spots, my moon has risen and become famous,  
And people get anxious when he shows up, overshadowing the beautiful ones.  
When he walks by the sea, the waves calm down and shy away,  
Everyone gets upset if he leaves; he has millions of admirers.

**[Verse 2]**  
My beloved, if he steps on the ground, people would retreat,  
And from his coolness, he isolates himself in a place with no creatures.  
He gestures from the sky; this beauty needs translation,  
Who has seen such a sight? Stay in your place above.

**[Chorus]**  
In the nightlife spots, my moon has risen and become famous,  
And people get anxious when he shows up, overshadowing the beautiful ones.
