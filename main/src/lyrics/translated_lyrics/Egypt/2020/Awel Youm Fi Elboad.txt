**Translated Lyrics:**

**First Day of Separation**  
The first day of separation,  
A day that feels like years, a lifetime between two lives.  
Walking alone, asking yourself, "Where am I going?"  
The first day of separation, when you lie down wounded and dreams fade away,  
Your feelings and your beloved leave you like the departing soul.  
The first day of separation,  
A day that feels like years, a lifetime between two lives.  
Walking alone, asking yourself, "Where am I going?"  
The first day of separation, when you lie down wounded and dreams fade away,  
Your feelings and your beloved leave you like the departing soul.

**[Chorus]**  
The first day since I met you, my heart is dying,  
The first time I think about why I'm living my life.  
Is it really possible that I won't hear your voice again,  
After I used to fall asleep, my love, and wake up to it?  
The first day since I met you, my heart is dying,  
The first time I think about why I'm living my life.  
Is it really possible that I won't hear your voice again,  
After I used to fall asleep, my love, and wake up to it?

**[Verse 2]**  
We had a life together, how will we make up for it, and with whom?  
The hardest thing is to destroy in a second what you built over years.  
The first day of separation, that's what I'm thinking aboutâ€”what will I do after this?  
Those who part from their dearest ones, oh my, may God give them strength.  

**[Chorus]**  
The first day since I met you, my heart is dying,  
The first time I think about why I'm living my life.  
Is it really possible that I won't hear your voice again,  
After I used to fall asleep, my love, and wake up to it?  
The first day since I met you, my heart is dying,  
The first time I think about why I'm living my life.  
Is it really possible that I won't hear your voice again,  
After I used to fall asleep, my love, and wake up to it?
