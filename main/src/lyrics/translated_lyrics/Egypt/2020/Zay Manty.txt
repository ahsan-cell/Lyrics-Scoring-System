**Translated Lyrics:**

You're still just as you are, a moon in my eyes  
The sweetest time was the one between you and I  
And when your name comes up in conversation, I say  
She's my precious love, a true lady in every way  
I could never accept any word against you  
You're above them all, you're a star shining through  
And if someone asks me about you, I say it's a blessing  
No matter what I say, your beauty is beyond expressing  

**[Chorus]**  
Just as you are, you mean the world to me, just as you are  
The love remains the same, and the feelings are concealed  
Just as you are, you mean the world to me, just as you are  
The love remains the same, and the feelings are concealed  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’ve left a sweet memory deep inside my heart  
I still hear your voice in my ears like a song that won’t part  
The truth is, life without you isn’t worth a dime  
My love for you grows stronger with each passing time  
Forget how you are and how you’re doing today  
The love remains the same, and the feelings are concealed  

**[Chorus]**  
Just as you are, you mean the world to me, just as you are  
The love remains the same, and the feelings are concealed  
Just as you are, you mean the world to me, just as you are  
The love remains the same, and the feelings are concealed  
Just as you are, you mean the world to me, just as you are  
The love remains the same, and the feelings are concealed
