**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh night, oh night, oh night  
Oh night, oh night, oh night  

**[Chorus]**  
Tell me about the one who's away, what’s his story?  
I fear tomorrow my heart will forget the one who holds its soul.  
Tell me about the one who's away, what’s his story? (Ah)  
I fear tomorrow my heart will forget the one who holds its soul.  
And how can he forget his beloved and find it easy to leave?  
Go tell him that I miss him so much, I just want to know he's okay.  
Tell me about the one who's away, what’s his story? (Tell me)  
I fear tomorrow my heart will forget the one who holds its soul. (Ah)  

**[Verse]**  
My soul, my beloved, my life,  
I want to come to you even if it takes a year.  
My soul, my beloved, my life,  
I want to come to you even if it takes a year.  
Oh my dear, my dear, my dear, my heart is melting,  
Oh my eyes, my eyes, my eyes, and the tears are flowing.  
You are the dearest of all to me, I swear by God.  
Ah, oh night, ah, oh my eyes.  

**[Chorus]**  
Tell me about the one who's away, what’s his story? (Ah)  
I fear tomorrow my heart will forget the one who holds its soul.  
And how can he forget his beloved and find it easy to leave?  
Go tell him that I miss him so much, I just want to know he's okay.  
Tell me about the one who's away, what’s his story? (What’s his story?)  
I fear tomorrow my heart will forget the one who holds its soul.  
And how can he forget his beloved and find it easy to leave?  
Go tell him that I miss him so much, I just want to know he's okay.
