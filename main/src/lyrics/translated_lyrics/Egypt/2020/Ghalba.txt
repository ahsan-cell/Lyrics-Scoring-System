**Translated Lyrics:**

(Victory, victory)  
(We’re here to make a change)  
(Victory, victory)  
(We’re here to have some fun)  
(Victory, victory)  
(We’re here to make a change)  
(Victory, victory)  
(Victory, victory)  

[Verse 1]  
I never run out like solar energy (bruh)  
Playing a friendly match with international flair (sco)  
Driving my mind while fame is beside me (bruh)  
I hear myself and I’m raising the song  
I hear myself heading towards fame  
I’m a pro, I’ll close the game  
My friend, I’m juggling two things  
(bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh)  
Always paying my debts  
Always scoring and putting it in the net  
I liked her hair, I’ll get her on the phone  
I broke the doors and changed the locks  
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
My love, don’t fly away like you’re a balloon  
My fame is rising, my friends are on the screen  
The curriculum is closed, everyone’s cheating  
I’ll take off the cap and hit the face  
My blood is royal, I’ll never back down  
I’ll get the BMW and the Porsche and celebrate  
I’ll bring bananas from Europe and we’ll chill  
I’ll bring them and we’ll eat, they’ll take care of me  
I’m not going down to take exams, I’m just chilling  
I’m just chilling, being carefree  
My love, thanks for the bag  
I’m an artist, I gotta show off  
I’ll wear you on my feet, you’re sandals  
I’ll smoke you in a cigarette, won’t overthink  
I’ll take your girl and we’ll do a massage  
I’ll definitely come once I cash in  
I’ll celebrate in the end and play Crash  

[Chorus]  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun  

[Verse 2]  
Let’s go and turn it up (bruh bruh)  
We’re here to mess it up  
There are many pictures in the street, oh my love, fame is tiring  
My training is tough, I drift and I hustle  
I’m excited to hit the stage, so I’m pumped  
I can’t be in your field unless I’m a real man  
Half of them are probably hurt from the pain  
Half of them are just talk, their words are empty  
If I see the thickest one, consider him stripped  
I win, I don’t lose, I’m Hassan Shehata*  
I’m taking the championship, I’m excelling  
You’ll graduate quickly and add to your degree  
You’ll graduate as a broadcaster but I’ll open a clinic  
I have a secret but it’s a story (oh)  
I came to kick but they told me not yet (bruh)  
I have time to give you a lesson  
I don’t have time and I won’t stress you (sco)  

[Chorus]  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change (sco)  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun (oh)  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun
