**Translated Lyrics:**

Sugar sprinkled on cream,  
Your heel bent, and the oud holds value.  
You come to me, finding me still well,  
You won't belong to anyone else,  
Yes, there’s no one like me.

**[Omar Kamel]**  
The neighbor's girl has my eyes,  
And in this place, I’m surrounded by people.  
I don’t want anyone to notice what I’m feeling,  
I saw the moon keeping me awake at night,  
And I’ll die for you, God knows how I feel.  
Leave your window open for me,  
Why do you close it?

**[Hassan Shakosh]**  
With my love, you’re sitting with me,  
Your eyes are a mirror for me.  
Oh, the beauty of your gaze,  
If you’re going to leave, I’ll call you,  
You’re mine, and I’m yours,  
We’re both tied together.  
Will you leave me to hate my life and my years?  
I’ll get lost and won’t find myself,  
And I’ll drink alcohol and hashish.  
You come to me, finding me still well,  
You won't belong to anyone else,  
Yes, there’s no one like me.

**[Omar Kamel]**  
Sugar sprinkled on cream,  
Your heel bent, and the oud holds value.  
Your glance drives the wise mad,  
You melted my heart with a step from your foot,  
You took my soul, left me and went to you,  
I’m with you, for you, and alongside you,  
I have to be.

**[Hassan Shakosh]**  
You occupy my mind, and I won’t tell you again,  
Everything hurts me.  
I see comfort in your eyes,  
Oh angel, my life is devoted to you.  
I’ll keep following you, wherever you go,  
Look at me and sway your waist,  
Let your eyes tell me  
What you’re hiding.

**[Unknown]**  
And tell me, what did you understand from my eyes?  
And answer my question,  
If you love me, tell me.

**[Omar Kamel]**  
You understood my eyes before I spoke,  
I want no one but you; I’m determined.  
Your beauty, everything about you is lovable,  
Your spirit is light, and your laughter is sweet,  
Like honey, oh sweetness of my soul.  
Because your love needs a million hearts,  
Because your love needs a million hearts.
