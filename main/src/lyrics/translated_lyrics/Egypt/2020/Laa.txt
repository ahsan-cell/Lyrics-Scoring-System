**Translated Lyrics:**

Is this okay? Is this what you want?
Is this okay? Is this what you want?
Is this okay? Is this what you want?

No, no... No, no... No, no...

You'd be crossing the line (no, no)
Don't greet me (no)
My eyes are on hers (no, no)
And her eyes are on mine (no)
My eyes are on hers (no, no)
And her eyes are on mine (no)

So is this okay? So is this what you want?
So is this okay? So is this what you want?

No
You wear tight clothes (no, no)
While I can barely move (no)
You wear tight clothes (no, no)
While I can barely move (no)
I can't walk (no, no)
And my friends are mocking (no)
I can't walk (no, no)
And my friends are mocking (no)

No... No, no...
So is this okay? So is this what you want?
So is this okay? So is this what you want?

No
You come back late (no, no)
Aren't I the jealous one? (no)
You stay out and party (no, no)
In the middle of the crowd (no)
You don't reply (no, no)
And you ignore me (no)
And you tease me (no, no)
And you set conditions for me

So is this okay? So is this what you want?
So is this okay? So is this what you want?

No
If you're with someone (no, no)
You run to them (no)
If you're not with someone (no, no)
Take a break (no)
Living the role (no, no)
Thinking her dad's a doctor (no)
He was famous (no, no)
The best carriage driver (no)
A well-mannered girl (no, no)
No, and well-trained (no)
She knows what she's doing (no, no)
Her mind is set

So is this okay? So is this what you want?
So is this okay? So is this what you want?

No
Girls (no, no)
Create stories (no)
Caught up in their games (no, no)
Coming with their tales (no)
All the girls are troublemakers (no, no)
Skilled in mischief (no)
With eyes like honey (no, no)
And those who wear traditional robes

So is this okay? So is this what you want?
So is this okay? So is this what you want?

No... No, no...
