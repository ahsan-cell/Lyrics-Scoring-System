**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Yes, because of you, I can carry on  
Whenever I’m tired, to you I go  
When the world seems to close in  
Your embrace is the last open door  
Oh, those eyes of yours, when I drown  
To me, they’re Noah’s Ark  
You’re the sweet spot in my heart  
Close to you, I feel no fear  
You’re my lover, my mother, my daughter  
Without you, there’s no other place for me  
You made me love the days of my life  
You brought me back to myself, to the past  

**[Chorus]**  
And when I’m in your hands, my feelings for you  
If I told you, they can’t be expressed  
You came and became my family and home  
If one day you leave, how will I live?  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’ve never let me down for a moment  
On the contrary, you’ve lifted me up  
You never sold me out or betrayed me  
And you give me more than I’ve given  
Before I call you, you come to me  
My support and strength if I shake  
My other half who understands me  
Before you, my life was uncounted  
Your love is what completes me  
Filling my gaps and flaws  
A feeling of safety reassures me  
In a life filled with wars  

**[Chorus]**  
And when I’m in your hands, my feelings for you  
If I told you, they never fade away  
You came and became my family and home  
If one day you leave, how will I live?
