**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I soar while I’m still in my place  
My life has been colored again  
Between you and before you  
There’s a big difference  
I soar while I’m still in my place  
My life has been colored again  
Oh, my comfort and the comfort of those in this world  
Oh, a blessing that has come  
I soar while I’m still in my place  
My life has been colored again  
Between you and before you  
There’s a big difference  
I soar while I’m still in my place  
My life has been colored again  
Oh, my comfort and the comfort of those in this world  
Oh, a blessing that has come  

[Chorus]  
With you, this world is calm and smiles at me  
And with the fortune that has come, the most precious treasure  
You’ve lit up my world, you’ve lit up my world  
And without you, nothing would mend my heart  
Stay in front of me for my sake  
Let me be by your side, let me be by your side  

[Verse 2]  
You’ve captured my heart with your influence  
I don’t want anyone else but you  
Next to you, everything’s beauty has multiplied  
In front of you, I forget the world  
With you, I don’t see anyone else  
Your beauty is something that doesn’t exist and won’t be seen  

[Chorus]  
With you, this world is calm and smiles at me  
And with the fortune that has come, the most precious treasure  
You’ve lit up my world, you’ve lit up my world  
And without you, nothing would mend my heart  
Stay in front of me for my sake  
Let me be by your side, let me be by your side  

[Outro]  
With you, this world is calm and smiles at me  
And with the fortune that has come, the most precious treasure  
Ah, you’ve lit up my world  
And without you, nothing would mend my heart  
Stay in front of me for my sake  
Let me be by your side, let me be by your side
