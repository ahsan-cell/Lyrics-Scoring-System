**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I reached her, and I secured her in your line,  
So I happily placed her on your shelf.  
She comes to you while you’re the one who leaves,  
You neglect her because she’s still holding on to you.  
You think she’s weak, that she can’t find her way,  
You’ve forgotten that you reached her with great effort.

[Chorus]  
So be careful, she’s capable of disappearing,  
And just as she’s holding onto you, she’ll let go.  
She can walk away easily and defy you,  
And you might not have a share in her anymore.  
If this information has escaped you,  
Well, now you know it’s in your hands.  
So be careful, she’s capable of disappearing,  
And just as she’s holding onto you, she’ll let go.  
She can walk away easily and defy you,  
And you might not have a share in her anymore.  
If this information has escaped you,  
Well, now you know it’s in your hands.

[Verse 2]  
I called her, and after her longing was clear,  
I found your hand suffocating her.  
Once upon a time, you held her with that same hand.  
You brought her chaos in her life, and you blindfolded  
Your eyes to the value of the blessing,  
To the dream that was precious and now feels distant.

[Chorus]  
So be careful, she’s capable of disappearing,  
And just as she’s holding onto you, she’ll let go.  
She can walk away easily and defy you,  
And you might not have a share in her anymore.  
If this information has escaped you,  
Well, now you know it’s in your hands.  
So be careful, she’s capable of disappearing,  
And just as she’s holding onto you, she’ll let go.  
She can walk away easily and defy you,  
And you might not have a share in her anymore.  
If this information has escaped you,  
Well, now you know it’s in your hands.

[Chorus]  
So be careful, she’s capable of disappearing,  
And just as she’s holding onto you, she’ll let go.  
She can walk away easily and defy you,  
And you might not have a share in her anymore.  
If this information has escaped you,  
Well, now you know it’s in your hands.
