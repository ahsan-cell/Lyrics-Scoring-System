**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Every promise I made to you, it's all for you, don’t be afraid  
Every dream will come in its time, so don’t worry  
I won’t fall short with you, believe me  
Stand strong, I gain my strength from you, don’t weaken  

[Chorus]  
You were once a dream I dreamed of one day  
I kept fighting through life until I achieved it  
And just like you stood by me, supporting me  
You’ll support me, and I’ll do more than I’ve done  
You were once a dream I dreamed of one day  
I kept fighting through life until I achieved it  
And just like you stood by me, supporting me  
You’ll support me, and I’ll do more than I’ve done  

[Verse 2]  
Ah, promise me you’ll stay close like my shadow, don’t drift away  
Every hardship I faced passed by with you beside me, it didn’t shake me  
The only one in my life who understands me  
With you, I’ll live my coming years  

[Chorus]  
You were once a dream I dreamed of one day  
I kept fighting through life until I achieved it  
And just like you stood by me, supporting me  
You’ll support me, and I’ll do more than I’ve done  
You were once a dream I dreamed of one day  
I kept fighting through life until I achieved it  
And just like you stood by me, supporting me  
You’ll support me, and I’ll do more than I’ve done
