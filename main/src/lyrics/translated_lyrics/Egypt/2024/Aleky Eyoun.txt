**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
On you, there are eyes  
That neither flatter nor betray  
In them lies a treasure of trust  
And secrets of beauty they hold  
On you, there are words  
That ease my sorrow and keep me whole  
They reassure my heart, bringing it back to calm  
So I can be with you like children  

[Chorus]  
On you, there is peace  
That strengthens me through the days  
There’s a force that pushes me forward  
With it, I continue my journey  
On you, there is tranquility  
The sweetness of your voice and a gaze of longing  
When I'm sad, seeing you brings me ease  
And I feel comfort and stability  

[Verse 2]  
On you, there is beauty  
And your heart is pure, a true soul  
With you, I live in complete ease  
Without you, I would be lost  
Your presence is a blessing  
With a smile that makes my day bright  
You support me when I lean  
I truly know how to choose  

[Chorus]  
On you, there is peace  
That strengthens me through the days  
There’s a force that pushes me forward  
With it, I continue my journey  
On you, there is tranquility  
The sweetness of your voice and a gaze of longing  
When I'm sad, seeing you brings me ease  
And I feel comfort and stability
