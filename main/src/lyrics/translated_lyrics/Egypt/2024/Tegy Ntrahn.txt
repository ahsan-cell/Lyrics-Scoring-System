**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Come, let’s make a bet  
That the day will come when you’ll say you regret it  
And that life will make you realize my worth  
Try to find  
From now until that day some words  
Just keep in mind what’s ahead  
I warned you, and remember that you insisted  

[Chorus]  
Come, let’s make a bet  
That you’ll return, and by then  
You won’t have excuses to tell me  
And I’ll turn my face that day  
To add a million pains to your sorrows  
Come, let’s make a bet  
That you’ll return, and by then  
You won’t have excuses to tell me  
And I’ll turn my face that day  
To add a million pains to your sorrows  

[Verse 2]  
My eyes in yours  
I’m not upset that I won’t be with you anymore  
Especially when you found out how easily I can forget you  
Oh, you left me  
But you know who you’re losing  
So why the tears in your eyes  
If there’s really no longing left inside you?  
My eyes in yours  
I’m not upset that I won’t be with you anymore  
Especially when you found out how easily I can forget you  
Oh, you left me  
But you know who you’re losing  
So why the tears in your eyes  
If there’s really no longing left inside you?  

[Chorus]  
Come, let’s make a bet  
That you’ll return, and by then  
You won’t have excuses to tell me  
And I’ll turn my face that day  
To add a million pains to your sorrows  
Come, let’s make a bet  
That you’ll return, and by then  
You won’t have excuses to tell me  
And I’ll turn my face that day  
To add a million pains to your sorrows
