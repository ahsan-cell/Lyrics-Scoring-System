**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The hardest thing in your life is to distance yourself from anyone,  
If distance were a man, I would have killed him right away.  
If distance brought peace, we would have rested and forgotten,  
But for a while now, we've been sleeping with tears in our eyes.

[Chorus]  
And we haven't found peace,  
Nor have the people who distanced themselves found rest after us.  
No loved ones will come one day to make us forget,  
This lack of peace is forced upon us; we can't calm down.  
And we haven't found peace,  
Nor have the people who distanced themselves found rest after us.  
No loved ones will come one day to make us forget,  
They said we would forget, but we are the ones who can't forget.

[Verse 2]  
The end always comes contrary to what we wished for,  
After you set your life up to be with someone.  
Life can take them away from our hands in seconds,  
Neither did they stay with us, nor are they strangers to us.

[Chorus]  
And we haven't found peace,  
Nor have the people who distanced themselves found rest after us.  
No loved ones will come one day to make us forget,  
This lack of peace is forced upon us; we can't calm down.  
And we haven't found peace,  
Nor have the people who distanced themselves found rest after us.  
No loved ones will come one day to make us forget,  
They said we would forget, but we are the ones who can't forget.
