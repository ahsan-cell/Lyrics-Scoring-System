**Translated Lyrics:**

And I’ll sing you ballads, I’ll tell tales of you,  
How, my love, despite the distance, there’s no space between us?  
We said we’d part one day, and after that, how many days?  
And despite the distance, sometimes I return and long for you one day.  

**[Chorus]**  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room in them,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten themselves from long ago,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  

**[Verse 2]**  
And if it were up to my heart, I’d long for you suddenly,  
And no matter what they say, I see you differently from all that’s been said.  
Your eyes enchant me when they meet mine, and I say, "Oh, how wonderful!"  
Where have you been all this time, my sweetest angel by my side?  

**[Chorus]**  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room in them,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten themselves from long ago,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  

**[Verse 3]**  
And here’s my state with you, staying up for you at times,  
And the stars of the night send you their greetings.  
And here’s my state with you, staying up for you at times,  
And the stars of the night send you their greetings.  

**[Chorus]**  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room in them,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten themselves from long ago,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room in them,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten themselves from long ago,  
Maybe you loved, then came and went, forgetting with the days.
