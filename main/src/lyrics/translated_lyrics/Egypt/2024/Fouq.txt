**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Get up  
Get up and mind your own business  
I've told you a thousand times  
Keep your feelings to yourself  
And your advice, keep it for yourself  
Get up  
Get up, do you really think  
That my heart doesn’t ache in your absence?  
Go on, you could have helped yourself  
When one day you could have helped me  

[Chorus]  
Aren't you tired of lying to me?  
What, do you think I’ll be just another victim?  
You’re the last person I could live for  
You’re someone whose only concern was hurting me  
Get up  

[Verse 2]  
Go away  
Just go, or are you free?  
To me, you’re just the past  
A period that passed in my life  
And life didn’t stop, it just went on  
Go away  
It’s a story I won’t repeat  
You’re a selfish person  
Why should I waste my life  
On someone who hurt and betrayed me?  

[Chorus]  
Aren't you tired of lying to me?  
What, do you think I’ll be just another victim?  
You’re the last person I could live for  
You’re someone whose only concern was hurting me  
Get up  

[Outro]  
Get up
