**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
I've seen so much from you, and now I'm at my limit,  
Is it really that easy for you to be cruel to me?  
What’s wrong with your heart? I’ve never seen any feeling in you.  
How can there be people in this world who are so harsh and hurtful?  
I've endured a lot from you, the one who took advantage of me,  
And you never stopped hurting me, not even for a day, did you?  
How do you sleep at night, filled with such arrogance?  
May God not forgive you for your wounds or your breaks in me.

**[Chorus]**  
Patience is beautiful,  
And soon you'll see, a day will come, and time will heal.  
It will bring me my rights; this is the prayer of the oppressed, and I’ve directed it at you.  
From my heart, I’ve come to truly hate you.  
A debt to be paid,  
So what do you think? This is a lesson from the past,  
You studied it, yet you still fail.  
This isn’t cruelty from me; you deserve much worse.

**[Verse 2]**  
I’ll seek refuge in God for the wasted time with you,  
And I’ll be the winner as long as I avoid your harm.  
Honestly, it’s fair and wise to let you go,  
If I pray against you, believe me, that’s your right, not injustice.  
What I’ve experienced with you, forgive me, I won’t return to it.  
And if they ever mention your name, I won’t know who they’re talking about.  
And this shock will pass; who told you I would die? It’s okay, it’s for the best.  
I understood my mistake, and I’ll be wise not to repeat it.  

**[Chorus]**  
Patience is beautiful,  
And soon you'll see, a day will come, and time will heal.  
It will bring me my rights; this is the prayer of the oppressed, and I’ve directed it at you.  
From my heart, I’ve come to truly hate you.  
A debt to be paid,  
So what do you think? This is a lesson from the past,  
You studied it, yet you still fail.  
This isn’t cruelty from me; you deserve much worse.
