**[Intro]**  
Tira-ra-ra  
Tira-ra  
Tra-ah-ah-ah  

**[Verse 1]**  
Everyone's jealous, filled with spite, their minds are dark  
If I pass by a place, I can't escape the comments  
What can I do? I'm a beautiful woman, and this is my charm  
I enter any space with confidence, thanks to God  
And those who see me are instantly captivated without struggle  
Some things are just God's creation, not something I worked for  

**[Chorus]**  
So let those who envy us come and be like us  
Without being bitter, talking behind our backs  
Let them face us, if they have something to say  
And enough with the gossip, we've heard enough about us  
Ah, let those who envy us come and be like us  
Without being bitter, talking behind our backs  
Let them face us, if they have something to say  
And enough with the gossip, we've heard enough about us  

**[Break]**  
Ah-ah-ah  
(Tira Tira)  
(Tira Tira)  

**[Verse 2]**  
As long as people talk about you, you have value  
They mention your name, whether in praise or gossip  
Leave it to God and relax, as long as intentions are pure  
And in these matters, I've gained years of experience  
People's words have become like gasoline to me  
They make me shine brighter and prove who I am  

**[Chorus]**  
So let those who envy us (ah) come and be like us  
Without being bitter, talking behind our backs  
Let them face us, if they have something to say  
And enough with the gossip, we've heard enough about us  
Let those who envy us come and be like us  
Without being bitter, talking behind our backs  
Let them face us, if they have something to say  
And enough with the gossip, we've heard enough about us  

**[Outro]**  
Ah-ah-ah-ah  
Tira Tira  
Tira Tira  
Tira Tira  
Tira Tira
