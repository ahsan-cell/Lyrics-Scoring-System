**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Elissa and Saad Lamjarred]**  
I can't help but look at you,  
And this is what I've come to.  
If I hear my name on your lips,  
I tell you to say it again.  
And I can never describe to you  
How much I love you.  
Draw me a star in your night,  
Its light shining in my eyes.  
Write me a word in your life,  
That people will talk about later.  
I want to live beyond my years,  
Oh my love, with you, I have two lifetimes.  
If you ask for my eyes,  
If you ask for my life too,  
I'll give you my coming years,  
And I'll be content and happy.  
You being by my side  
Makes me feel like I'm a human.

**[Chorus: Elissa and Saad Lamjarred]**  
From the very first moment,  
My heart tilted for your love.  
I knew in a hundred ways  
How you change my state.  
I get lost between reality  
Oh my life and fantasy.  
From the very first moment,  
My heart tilted for your love.  
You knew in a hundred ways  
How to change my state.  
I get lost between reality  
Oh my life and fantasy.

**[Verse 2: Elissa and Saad Lamjarred]**  
I want you to stay by my side,  
My support and the knight of my dreams.  
My heart feels secure with you close,  
Always keep yourself in front of me.  
Before I even say a word,  
You complete my sentences.  
Your presence completes me,  
You made my life a life.  
My feeling of love took me,  
And I’ll keep walking behind it.  
Your embrace, my darling, I could never  
Live a second without it.  
There’s someone who fills your back,  
And in your weakness, she’ll strengthen you.  
You command her, my love, and she’ll obey,  
She’ll say, “Here I am for you.”  
By your side until the end of your days,  
She’ll live to please you.

**[Chorus: Elissa and Saad Lamjarred]**  
Ah, from the very first moment,  
My heart tilted for your love.  
I knew in a hundred ways  
How you change my state.  
I get lost between reality  
Oh my life and fantasy.  
From the very first moment,  
My heart tilted for your love.  
You knew in a hundred ways  
How to change my state.  
I get lost between reality  
Oh my life and fantasy.
