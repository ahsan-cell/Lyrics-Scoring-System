**Translated Lyrics:**

Let’s take some time apart  
And see how it feels when we’re away  
Consider it a temporary distance  
And honestly, it’s better for both of us this way  
Let’s take some time apart  
And see how it feels when we’re away  
Either we wake up and return to each other  
Or we say it just wasn’t meant to be  

**[Chorus]**  
And I’m still holding on to the moments I lived by your side  
Even though you’re tough, there were things about you I loved  
Let’s take some time apart, maybe this distance will help us  
And if someone asks you about me, don’t say our story has ended  
And I’m still holding on to the moments I lived by your side  
Even though you’re tough, there were things about you I loved  
Let’s take some time apart, maybe this distance will help us  
And if someone asks you about me, don’t say our story has ended  

**[Verse 2]**  
Sometimes the value of something is realized when it’s far away  
And I’m reassured in this distance that we’ll miss each other for sure  
And we’ll see when and why we got upset with each other  
So if we come back again, we can learn from these days  

**[Chorus]**  
And I’m still holding on to the moments I lived by your side  
Even though you’re tough, there were things about you I loved  
Let’s take some time apart, maybe this distance will help us  
And if someone asks you about me, don’t say our story has ended  
And I’m still holding on to the moments I lived by your side  
Even though you’re tough, there were things about you I loved  
Let’s take some time apart, maybe this distance will help us  
And if someone asks you about me, don’t say our story has ended
