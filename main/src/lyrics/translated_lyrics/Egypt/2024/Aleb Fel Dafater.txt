**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
A heart in the notebooks finds poetry speaking of us, remember?  
The days when we dreamed of being under a shelter's shade.  
Tell me what we had in those days, now our words feel cold.  
I can't find anyone but you, even in distance, I flirt.  
A heart in the notebooks finds poetry speaking of us, remember?  
The days when we dreamed of being under a shelter's shade.  
Tell me what we had in those days, now our words feel cold.  
I can't find anyone but you, even in distance, I flirt.  

**[Verse 2]**  
At the end of the road, I found nothing but my sad melody.  
Tears have dried from the weight of my patience over the years.  
Believe what they told you, that some love is a debt.  
Tears have dried; there's nothing left in my eyes.  
At the end of the road, I found nothing but my sad melody.  
Tears have dried from the weight of my patience over the years.  
Believe what they told you, that some love is a debt.  
Tears have dried; there's nothing left in my eyes.  

**[Verse 3]**  
It's strange to love you even when you're not here.  
I'm still holding on to what we had; our pictures still guide me.  
The streets were filled with the winter nights that overwhelmed us.  
My heart is infatuated with you; God bears witness to me.  
It's strange to love you even when you're not here.  
I'm still holding on to what we had; our pictures still guide me.  
The streets were filled with the winter nights that overwhelmed us.  
My heart is infatuated with you; God bears witness to me.  

**[Verse 4]**  
Your patience is all good.  
Your sadness remains different.  
You're blind but you fly.  
To which harbor will you dock every day?  
Are you awake or still asleep?  
And the night keeps you awake in fear.  
The coffee is described for you.  
The light surrounds you; see,  
Or is it still far away?  
"I replied and said, 'Forget.'"  
Your patience is all good.  
Your sadness remains different.  
You're blind but you fly.  
To which harbor will you dock every day?  
Are you awake or still asleep?  
And the night keeps you awake in fear.  
The coffee is described for you.  
The light surrounds you; see,  
Or is it still far away?  
"I replied and said, 'Forget.'"  

**[Verse 5]**  
The emptiness that came from your left added something to you.  
It gathered you, and you began to cry over nothing.  
The emptiness that came from your right clouded your vision.  
You started to disdain the same air after the thirst of the night.  
The emptiness that came from your left added something to you.  
It gathered you, and you began to cry over nothing.  
The emptiness that came from your right clouded your vision.  
You started to disdain the same air after the thirst of the night.  

**[Bridge]**  
Where have we ended up? (Where have we ended up?)  
The soul longs for a glance from your eyes.  
Ah, where have we ended up?  
Ah, the soul longs for a glance from your eyes.  
Tell me, where are you?  

**[Verse 2]**  
At the end of the road, I found nothing but my sad melody.  
Tears have dried from the weight of my patience over the years.  
Believe what they told you, that some love is a debt.  
Tears have dried; there's nothing left in my eyes.  
At the end of the road, I found nothing but my sad melody.  
Tears have dried from the weight of my patience over the years.  
Believe what they told you, that some love is a debt.  
Tears have dried; there's nothing left in my eyes.
