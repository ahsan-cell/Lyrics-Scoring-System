**Translated Lyrics:**

He'll come to me, wounded, tears in his tired eyes  
Give him a week, then he'll come back regretful and shy  
He'll come and see what I’m planning at that time  
He’ll come with fear showing in his words and in his eyes  

**[Chorus]**  
He’ll see another side of me, I hope he doesn’t see it  
Is it possible that when he comes back, he won’t feel the pain?  
I’m determined, if he wakes up, I won’t hold back what I say  
Where will he go? Who else is left? People have gone and never returned.  

**[Verse 2]**  
Poor thing, so helpless, they told me he’s lost for good  
Oh my eyes, full of hope, tell him it’s over with goodbye  
He’ll come and go, but it’ll be in vain, nothing will change  
The picture is clear, he’s dying while I’m still living  
Poor thing, so helpless, they told me he’s lost for good  
Oh my eyes, full of hope, tell him it’s over with goodbye  
He’ll come and go, but it’ll be in vain, nothing will change  
The picture is clear, he’s dying while I’m still living  

**[Chorus]**  
He’ll see another side of me, I hope he doesn’t see it  
Is it possible that when he comes back, he won’t feel the pain?  
I’m determined, if he wakes up, I won’t hold back what I say  
Where will he go? Who else is left? People have gone and never returned.
