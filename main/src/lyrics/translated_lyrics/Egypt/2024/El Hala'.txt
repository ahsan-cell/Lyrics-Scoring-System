**[Intro]**  
Yeah, bring it  

**[Chorus]**  
The earrings causing a stir,  
Forgive my heart if it gets stolen.  
I swear and declare to everyone,  
Whoever leaves it behind is wrong.  
It's got a chain wrapped around it,  
And the look is causing trouble.  
So lucky is the one who bought me,  
'Cause the one who bought me is winning.  
(Ah, bring it)  
And the earrings causing a stir,  
Forgive my heart if it gets stolen.  
Oh, I swear and declare to everyone,  
Whoever leaves it behind is wrong.  
It's got a chain wrapped around it,  
And the look is causing trouble.  
So lucky is the one who bought me,  
'Cause the one who bought me is winning.  

**[Verse 1]**  
With flowers, she's fragrant,  
No, she's drawn with precision.  
And this step is so confident,  
She walks and makes hearts flutter.  
With flowers, she's fragrant,  
No, she's drawn with precision.  
And this step is so confident,  
She walks and makes hearts flutter.  

**[Verse 2]**  
And her hair curves down,  
Hanging at her waist, oh my.  
I saw that and Iâ€™m mesmerized,  
I'm just describing a mannequin.  

**[Break]**  
Break it, break it,  
Break it down now,  
Bring it again.  

**[Verse 3]**  
The bag hanging,  
On your shoulder, let it drop.  
Why are we talking about worries?  
Promise me anywhere you go.  
The bag hanging,  
On your shoulder, let it drop.  
Why are we talking about worries?  
Promise me anywhere you go.  

**[Chorus]**  
With the earrings causing a stir,  
Forgive my heart if it gets stolen.  
Oh, I swear and declare to everyone,  
Whoever leaves it behind is wrong.  
It's got a chain wrapped around it,  
And the look is causing trouble.  
So lucky is the one who bought me,  
'Cause the one who bought me is winning.  

**[Break]**  
Break it down now,  
I don't know man, I like this track right here.  
I don't know about you man,  
I hope you guys, you guys like this hook.  

**[Outro]**  
Yeah, this is my job and this is what I do.
