**Translated Lyrics:**

I said from the very start, let’s not go there  
Hoping for more, just let me live my life fair  
I’ve gotten used to joy bringing me worry  
I don’t hang my hopes high, only to be sorry  
And look at you, you did this to me, walked away and left scars  
My heart’s in shock since that day, can’t believe how far  

**[Chorus]**  
I made it easy for you  
And you came with a heart, can you really hurt me too?  
Should I say may God forgive you or should I say He’ll repay you?  
Why break a promise that’s not easy to undo?  
Give me reasons  
Why do you hurt me as if you’re settling scores?  
What did I do to deserve this, when I’m the one who’s ignored?  
I didn’t deserve all this, I didn’t deserve  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’m lost in this world, alone without you  
As if there’s no hope, no one else but you  
Who could save me from what I’m going through?  
I don’t listen to those who say I should forget you  
With what you’ve done, I’m still waiting for you  
And my heart has no strength, how can it let go?  

**[Chorus]**  
I made it easy for you  
And you came with a heart, can you really hurt me too?  
Should I say may God forgive you or should I say He’ll repay you?  
Why break a promise that’s not easy to undo?  
Give me reasons  
Why do you hurt me as if you’re settling scores?  
What did I do to deserve this, when I’m the one who’s ignored?  
I didn’t deserve all this, I didn’t deserve  

**[Chorus]**  
Give me reasons  
Why do you hurt me as if you’re settling scores?  
What did I do to deserve this, when I’m the one who’s ignored?  
I didn’t deserve all this, I didn’t deserve
