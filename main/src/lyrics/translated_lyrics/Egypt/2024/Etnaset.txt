**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
I don’t know what to do anymore,  
My state doesn’t even concern me.  
Is this really what we’ve come to?  
I let go, knowing my soul is in it.  
Everything but the separation,  
So don’t leave me while I’m longing.  
I never imagined a day  
When I’d be apart and leave my heart with you.  
I’ll believe you and doubt my eyes,  
You’ve seen the best of me.  
And I never intended  
To forget you and let you slip away from my hands.

**[Chorus]**  
And I’ve been forgotten as if I never came,  
And if you feel it, you’ll break me.  
I hid it in my heart and walked away,  
As if you’ve made me a stranger.  
And I’ve been forgotten as if I never came,  
And if you feel it, you’ll break me.  
I hid it in my heart and walked away,  
As if you’ve made me a stranger.

**[Verse 2]**  
The absence has been long, and your love is overwhelming,  
I’m hoping for the light in your eyes,  
A million answers left at the door you refuse.  
And it’s not under my control,  
My soul departed after you left.  
Between forgetting you and returning,  
My heart split in two.  
One part can’t hide,  
And the other refuses to stay by my side.  
I knew I’d end up alone,  
The one who loses twice—  
Once when I accepted your flaws,  
And once when I hid your eyes.  
While you lied to your own thoughts,  
From the start, you never loved me,  
And I won’t add to the blame.  
It won’t matter in the quarrel,  
If your eyes meet mine,  
Just walk away and don’t throw me a greeting.

**[Chorus]**  
And I’ve been forgotten as if I never came,  
And if you feel it, you’ll break me.  
I hid it in my heart and walked away,  
As if you’ve made me a stranger.  
And I’ve been forgotten as if I never came,  
And if you feel it, you’ll break me.  
I hid it in my heart and walked away,  
As if you’ve made me a stranger.
