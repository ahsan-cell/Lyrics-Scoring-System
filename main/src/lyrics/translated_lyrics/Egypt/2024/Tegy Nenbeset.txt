**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
My love, come let’s have some fun,  
Even if the world gets tough.  
We’ll walk and turn our backs on it,  
We’ll chill while we’re alone.  
And if people go wild, let them, let them,  
It’s fine if they go wild, oh.  
My love, come let’s have some fun,  
Even if the world gets tough.  
We’ll walk and turn our backs on it,  
We’ll chill while we’re alone.  
And if people go wild, let them, let them,  
It’s fine if they go wild, let them.

[Chorus]  
Put your hand on my shoulders,  
And let’s spin the world around.  
You’ll find a warm embrace,  
And our worries will fade away.  
Leave your fears of the world behind,  
Leave them, leave them, my love, and I’ll leave mine.  
Leave them, leave them, my love, and I’ll leave mine.  
Oh, let’s set them aside on any shelf.

[Verse 2]  
My love, don’t hold us back,  
Let’s break free from the formalities.  
They’ll say we’ve gone crazy?  
Let them say we’ve gone crazy.  
No one has anything on us, on us,  
Nothing at all on us.  
My love, let’s create,  
New words of love to touch.  
A song we’ll sing to each other,  
Joy that comes from our hearts.  
A new dance we’ll dance, we’ll dance,  
Oh my love, let’s dance, let’s dance.

[Chorus]  
Put your hand on my shoulders,  
And let’s spin the world around.  
You’ll find a warm embrace,  
And our worries will fade away.  
Leave your fears of the world behind,  
Leave them, leave them, my love, and I’ll leave mine.  
Leave them, leave them, my love, and I’ll leave mine.  
I’ll leave them,  
Let’s set them aside on any shelf.  
Shelf, shelf, shelf.

[Verse 1]  
My love, come let’s have some fun, let’s have some fun,  
Even if the world gets tough.  
We’ll walk and turn our backs on it,  
We’ll chill while we’re alone.  
And if people go wild, let them, let them,  
It’s fine if they go wild, fine, fine.  
It’s fine if they go wild, fine, fine, wild.  
It’s fine if they go wild, let them.

[Outro]  
It’s fine, fine, fine, fine,  
It’s fine if they go wild, fine.  
It’s fine if they go wild, let them.  
It’s fine if they go wild,  
Oh, let them go wild.
