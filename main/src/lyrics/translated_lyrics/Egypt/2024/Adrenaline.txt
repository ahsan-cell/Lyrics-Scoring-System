**Translated Lyrics:**

I touched your hand, made contact,  
Electricity surged through my veins,  
Boosted the adrenaline,  
My heart and eyes can't take it.  
I walked my heart down the line, didn’t veer left or glance right,  
I’m tangled up, mixed up, caught in a trap, I’m set up for a surprise.

[Before the Chorus]  
Oh, the smile, the smile,  
And the lute, the drawing, the drawing,  
It came at just the right time,  
Not a moment too soon, oh my!  
Oh, the lightness, the lightness,  
And the lute, the twirl, the twirl,  
It came at just the right time,  
Not after the longing, oh my!

[Chorus]  
I touched your hand, made contact,  
Electricity surged through my veins,  
Boosted the adrenaline,  
My heart and eyes can't take it.  
I walked my heart down the line, didn’t veer left or glance right,  
I’m tangled up, mixed up, caught in a trap, I’m set up for a surprise.

[Verse]  
Just one second, let’s understand,  
This beauty is merciless,  
This beauty burns like fire,  
Every glance is pure delight.  
Just one second, let’s study,  
This beauty can tear you apart,  
This beauty’s flames are blazing,  
From the charm and the allure.  
Just one moment, let’s calm down,  
Who can match this beauty?  
This beauty’s fire is paradise,  
Forgive us if we’re enchanted.  
One moment, just one moment,  
Honestly, the most beautiful one,  
In its flavor, it’s overwhelming,  
A piece, two pieces, three, six.

[Before the Chorus]  
Oh, the smile, the smile,  
And the lute, the drawing, the drawing,  
It came at just the right time,  
Not a moment too soon, oh my!  
Oh, the lightness, the lightness,  
And the lute, the twirl, the twirl,  
It came at just the right time,  
Not after the longing, oh my!

[Chorus]  
I touched your hand, made contact,  
Electricity surged through my veins,  
Boosted the adrenaline,  
My heart and eyes can't take it.  
I walked my heart down the line, didn’t veer left or glance right,  
I’m tangled up, mixed up, caught in a trap, I’m set up for a surprise.
