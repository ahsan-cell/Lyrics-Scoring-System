**Translation:**

**Exceler is a golden opportunity for bringing rappers together, allowing them to exchange experiences and knowledge in real life, pulling them out of the prison of the virtual world. This initiative could evolve into a true school if other ideas are embodied, such as organizing battle sessions or technical challenges between rappers and beatmakers.**

**Lamou & Psycorap – Dzair l3adra**  
The Nomad group started last year with two members: Lamou and El Harraz, then expanded this year to include its own beatmaker (Tso Beat) along with Bixou and S.O.S.H. The development of this young group is slow despite their continuous presence in the scene with acceptable periodic works; however, we still need a solid project or a new concept to judge them objectively. Founders Lamou and El Harraz are preparing mixtapes for each of them, which will be the right opportunity to assess their progress and maturity... Let's wait and see what the children of Tizi have in store.

**TF9AF (Armory De La Rime) - Men lakher**  
The Bouiri rap group "Armory De La Rime" has been present on many fronts this year: the release of the "Karizm" album, two mixtapes for the group ("Hasha Al-Sameen") and another solo for Tawfik ("10 Tons"), in addition to participating in episode 2 of the "Exceler" series, not to mention the weekly freestyles.

But does the abundance of production match the quality presented? The group makes significant efforts that cannot be denied, and they deserve all the praise and respect, but there has been no substantial development in what they offer since the beginning of the year. The first noticeable thing is the disparity in the members' levels: Tawfik is the most active and prominent, Casanova from Constantine has a distinctive vocal tone and delivered a good performance in Exceler, while Samir Diga, Wahab Baron, and Tchi are lagging behind, not standing out in flow or writing. 

Typically, there are two important elements in groups with many members (like Armory): diversity and integration. Each member should bring their unique touch, whether in flow, charisma, techniques, or writing... but in the end, everyone should complement each other, and the listener should not feel any lack or disharmony in the final product.

Overall, Armory is an underground group that offers rap much better than some mainstream rappers who gained quick fame despite their limited skills. By the way, we have yet to hear the "Karizm" album because we couldn't find it in the market, as distribution is local and not national, and we will discuss it when the opportunity arises.

**Farid Kalamity - Ibliss**  
Ibliss 2015 by Farid is essentially an update of Lotfi Virus 2002, developing some ideas and creating a visual composition that makes the work somewhat different.

However, the most notable aspect of Farid's career this year is not Ibliss or Ghadr, but his continued role as an activist and important intermediary. He is not just a rapper; as we know, he is a music producer working with many faces, not to mention his help in activating Planet Hip Hop. He does not fall short in his role, but the show generally seems to revolve in a vacuum, and we do not know yet whether it is aimed at the general public or a specific audience, as neither finds what they seek or their purpose in watching it.

In general, even though Farid still lacks a distinctive touch, whether on the mic or behind it, he is a rapper who moves a lot and has significant relationships in the field, which is essential for continuity and development, unlike many rappers who are confined to their virtual worlds and gradually self-destruct without realizing it.

**Sawt elil - Tiha w Tnod**  
**Bledart – Symbol**  
**L'oreille D'or - Hadra Rassas**  
**Ishak Boss - El nefs**  
We do not know much about Ishak Boss; he is still an obscure rapper, but the clip "El Nefs" surprised with its bold "image," which is unusual for us. It is not that kind of lowbrow boldness but one that remains faithful to the sensitive nature of the text as much as possible while respecting the red lines. The two young actors performed their roles perfectly, which perhaps was lacking in Farid's song "Ghadr," as the
