**Translated Lyrics:**

It no longer suits you to be upset and hold me accountable,  
What’s forcing you to live this life and what we’ve become?  
Don’t worry about me, I’m just lying around,  
Wake up, man, I’m leaving, I’ll shout it in the street, hey!  
It no longer suits you to be upset and hold me accountable,  
What’s forcing you to live this life and what we’ve become?  
Don’t worry about me, I’m just lying around,  
Wake up, man, I’m leaving, I’ll shout it in the street, hey!

**[Chorus]**  
I’m going to throw a festival, a festival,  
And I’ll forget what was, no matter what.  
My story with you was once upon a time,  
Why do you want to relive it with me?  
I’m going to throw a festival, a festival,  
And I’ll forget what was, no matter what.  
My story with you was once upon a time,  
Why do you want to relive it with me?

**[Verse 2]**  
You, like you, really have a solution instead of all this,  
Here’s the path, and here’s the door wide open.  
Go in peace, don’t worry about blame,  
You won’t leave a mark, and what comes easy will go just as easily.  
You, like you, really have a solution instead of all this,

You won’t leave a mark, and what comes easy will go just as easily.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m going to throw a festival, a festival,  
And I’ll forget what was, no matter what.  
My story with you was once upon a time,  
Why do you want to relive it with me?  
I’m going to throw a festival, a festival,  
And I’ll forget what was, no matter what.

Why do you want to relive it with me?

**[Chorus]**  
I’m going to throw a festival, a festival,  
And I’ll forget what was, no matter what.
