**Translated Lyrics:**

They told me a lot about her,  
They said her beauty is like a dream,  
But when I met her, it was different,  
This is something beyond imagination.  

**[Chorus]**  
No, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
What is all this? Why am I so calm?  
Yes, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
Look at what my heart is feeling.  
No, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
What is all this? Why am I so calm?  
Yes, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
Look at what my heart is feeling.  

**[Verse 2]**  
I've seen a lot, but little compares,  
But this one in particular,  
Has details that set my heart ablaze.  

**[Chorus]**  
No, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
What is all this? Why am I so calm?  
Yes, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
Look at what my heart is feeling.  
No, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
What is all this? Why am I so calm?  
Yes, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
Look at what my heart is feeling.  

**[Chorus]**  
No, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
What is all this? Why am I so calm?  
Yes, she's amazing, amazing, amazing,  
Look at what my heart is feeling.  
Look at what my heart is feeling.
