**Translated Lyrics:**

In front of her mirror, she takes her time to pamper herself,  
I wait for her and urge her on, she laughs at me and I gaze at her.  
She picks her colors, asks my opinion on her dress,  
But how can I choose when her beauty makes the world shine bright?

**[Verse 1]**  
With my eyes, I see her as the prettiest of all,  
She carries herself with grace, who can compare, who can stand tall?  
I want no one else, I see no one but her,  
She’s the star in my sight.

**[Chorus]**  
In front of her mirror, she takes her time to pamper herself,  
I wait for her and urge her on, she laughs at me and I gaze at her.  
She picks her colors, asks my opinion on her dress,  
But how can I choose when her beauty makes the world shine bright?

**[Verse 2]**  
I weaken in front of her, what can I do?  
Her words are enough; I can’t resist them, it’s true.  
I want no one else, I see no one but her,  
She’s a moon, but what more can I say?

**[Chorus]**  
In front of her mirror, she takes her time to pamper herself,  
I wait for her and urge her on, she laughs at me and I gaze at her.  
She picks her colors, asks my opinion on her dress,  
But how can I choose when her beauty makes the world shine bright?  
In front of her mirror, she takes her time to pamper herself,  
I wait for her and urge her on, she laughs at me and I gaze at her.  
She picks her colors, asks my opinion on her dress,  
But how can I choose when her beauty makes the world shine bright?
