**Translated Lyrics:**

I love him in his playfulness and his seriousness,  
I love him in his lack of sense,  
I love him in his jealousy over me, even when he imagines things.  
I love him in his playfulness and his seriousness,  
I love him in his lack of sense,  
I love him in his jealousy over me, even when he imagines things.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m used to his nature,  
I know it well and have gotten used to it.  
There’s no one like him, nor will I find his kind,  
I love him, what can I do?  
Ah, I’m used to his nature,  
I know it well and have gotten used to it.  
When we argue, I let it go and obey him,  
I love him, what can I do?

**[Bridge]**  
The fire, the fire of his love for me,  
The fire, the fire,  
His distance from me is a burning fire,  
He occupies my thoughts day and night.

**[Verse 2]**  
I love him,  
And I love how his eyes follow me,  
He drives me crazy and worries me,  
I love him, and I swear to him, but he never believes me.  
I love him,  
My darling in all his moods,  
In his suspicions and his stories,  
When will he understand, my love, while I take care of all his concerns?

**[Chorus]**  
I’m used to his nature,  
I know it well and have gotten used to it.  
There’s no one like him, nor will I find his kind,  
I love him, what can I do?  
Ah, I’m used to his nature,  
I know it well and have gotten used to it.  
When we argue, I let it go and obey him,  
I love him, what can I do?

**[Chorus]**  
Ah, I’m used to his nature,  
I know it well and have gotten used to it.  
When we argue, I let it go and obey him,  
I love him, what can I do?
