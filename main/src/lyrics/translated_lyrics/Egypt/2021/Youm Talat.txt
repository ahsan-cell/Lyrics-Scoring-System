**Translated Lyrics:**

**Chorus:**
On a Tuesday, three girls called to me  
On the carpet, oh people, they amazed me  
Sitting and enjoying, they invited me for tomorrow  
They broke the sweets, and enchanted me  
On a Tuesday, three girls called to me  
On the carpet, oh people, they amazed me  
Sitting and enjoying, they invited me for tomorrow  
They broke the sweets, and enchanted me  

**Verse 1:**  
It seems like a conspiracy  
I love the dark one, but I also love the fair one with rosy cheeks  
Life is sweet with you, oh spirit so lovely  
They're all beautiful, they've driven me crazy  
Every time I try to get up, I say let me stay  
So much beauty, it dazzles my eyes  
If I walk away from this place, what will lead me?  
The gathering of beauties tempts me  

**Verse 2:**  
Their hair like silk flies before me  
It's hard to see this anywhere else, only in my dreams  
Their magic is dangerous, how can I describe my words?  
On a Tuesday and throughout all my days  
Each one more beautiful than the last  
My heart has not returned to me again  
I had a stick in my hand, I sang with it  
And the morning is bright, oh how I adore it  

**Verse 3:**  
A word or two, the night calls to me  
We lived a beautiful day, better than I could imagine  
One by one, they lean towards me  
If I live my life here, it would be too little  

**Chorus:**  
On a Tuesday, three girls called to me  
On the carpet, oh people, they amazed me  
Sitting and enjoying, they invited me for tomorrow  
They broke the sweets, and enchanted me
