**Translated Lyrics:**

Is this okay? Is this what you want?  
Is this okay? Is this what you want?  
Is this okay? Is this what you want?  

No, no... No, no... No, no  

You'd be crossing the line (no, no)  
Don't greet me (no)  
My eyes in her eyes (no, no)  
And her eyes in mine (no)  
My eyes in her eyes (no, no)  
And her eyes in mine (no)  

So is this okay? So is this what you want?  
So is this okay? So is this what you want?  

No  
You wear tight clothes (no, no)  
While my knees are weak (no)  
You wear tight clothes (no, no)  
While my knees are weak (no)  
I can't walk (no, no)  
And my friends are mocking (no)  
I can't walk (no, no)  
And my friends are mocking (no)  

No... No, no  
So is this okay? So is this what you want?  
So is this okay? So is this what you want?  

No  
You come back late (no, no)  
Aren't I the jealous one? (no)  
You stay out and flirt (no, no)  
In the middle of the crowd (no)  
You don't reply (no, no)  
And you ignore me (no)  
And you tease me (no, no)  
And you set conditions for me  

So is this okay? So is this what you want?  
So is this okay? So is this what you want?  

No  
If you're with someone (no, no)  
You run to them (no)  
If you're not with someone (no, no)  
Take a break (no)  
Living the role (no, no)  
Thinking her dad's a doctor (no)  
He was famous (no, no)  
The best carriage driver (no)  
A well-mannered girl (no, no)  
No, and well-trained (no)  
She knows what to do (no, no)  
Her mind is set  

So is this okay? So is this what you want?  
So is this okay? So is this what you want?  

No  
Girls (no, no)  
Create stories (no)  
Caught up in their games (no, no)  
Coming with their tales (no)  
All the girls are troublemakers (no, no)  
Clever in their tricks (no)  
With eyes like honey (no, no)  
And those who wear traditional robes  

So is this okay? So is this what you want?  
So is this okay? So is this what you want?  

No... No, no
