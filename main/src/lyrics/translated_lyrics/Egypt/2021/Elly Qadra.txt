**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
She who can face challenges and confronts,  
And she who, in her fear, declares her protest.  
She remains the one who has the right to say a thousand no's,  
If her days don’t go as she wishes.  
She who rejects existence remains a barrier,  
Or leaves someone to treat her with disdain.  
It’s hard to be surrounded by walls, easy if she gets angry and erupts,  
Her pride prevents her from playing the coward's role.

[Chorus]  
I’m strong, tasting life as long as I claim my rights,  
I won’t appear broken, nor will I show weakness any day.  
I’m strong, tasting life, seeing that my place is above,  
And she who lived like a queen won’t live as a servant.  
I’m strong, tasting life as long as I claim my rights,  
I won’t appear broken, nor will I show weakness any day.  
Ah, I’m strong, tasting life, seeing that my place is above,  
And she who lived like a queen won’t live as a servant.

[Verse 2]  
I won’t let a heart that sees me not want me,  
I won’t let my tears fall without my permission.  
I won’t live for anyone but myself, my feelings won’t be silenced,  
I won’t stop laughing even in the midst of my sorrow.  
I won’t let a heart that sees me not want me,  
I won’t let my tears fall without my permission.  
I won’t live for anyone but myself, my feelings won’t be silenced,  
I won’t stop laughing even in the midst of my sorrow.

[Chorus]  
I’m strong, tasting life as long as I claim my rights,  
I won’t appear broken, nor will I show weakness any day.  
I’m strong, tasting life, seeing that my place is above,  
And she who lived like a queen won’t live as a servant.  
I’m strong, tasting life as long as I claim my rights,  
I won’t appear broken, nor will I show weakness any day.  
I’m strong, tasting life, seeing that my place is above,  
And she who lived like a queen won’t live as a servant.
