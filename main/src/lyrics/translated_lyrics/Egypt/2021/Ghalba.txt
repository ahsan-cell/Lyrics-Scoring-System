**Translated Lyrics:**

(Victory, victory)  
(We’re here to make a change)  
(Victory, victory)  
(We’re here to have some fun)  
(Victory, victory)  
(We’re here to make a change)  
(Victory, victory)  
(Victory, victory)  

[Verse 1]  
I never run out like solar energy (bruh)  
Playing a friendly match with international flair (sco)  
Driving my mind while fame is beside me (bruh)  
I hear myself and raise the song  
I hear myself heading for fame  
I’m a pro, I’ll close the game  
My friend, I’m juggling two lives  
(bruh bruh bruh bruh bruh)  
Always paying my dues  
Always scoring and bringing it home  
I liked her hair, I’ll call her up  
I broke the doors and changed the locks  
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh)  
My love, don’t fly away like a balloon  
My fame is rising, my friends are on the screen  
The curriculum’s locked, everyone’s cheating  
I’ll take off the cap and show my face  
Royal blood in me, I’ll never back down  
I’ll get the BMW and the Porsche, and I’ll celebrate  
I’ll bring bananas from Europe and we’ll chill  
I’ll bring them and we’ll eat, they’ll take care of me  
I’m not here to take tests, I’m just chilling  
I’m just chilling, being carefree  
My love, thanks for the bag  
I’m an artist, I gotta shine  
I’ll wear you on my feet, you’re my sandals  
I’ll smoke you in a cigarette, won’t overthink  
I’ll take your girl and we’ll have a massage  
I’ll definitely come once I cash in  
I’ll celebrate in the end and play Crash  

[Chorus]  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun  

[Verse 2]  
Let’s go and turn it up (bruh bruh)  
We’re here to mess it up  
Pictures in the street are plenty, oh darling, fame is tiring  
My training’s tough, I drift and hustle  
I’m eager to hit the stage, so I’m pumped up  
I can’t be in your field unless I’m a real man  
Half of them are probably hurt from pain  
Half of them are just talk, their words are empty  
If I see the thickest one, consider him stripped  
I win, I don’t lose, I’m Hassan Shehata*  
I’m taking the championship, I’m excelling  
You’ll graduate quickly and add to your degree  
You’ll graduate as a host but I’ll open a clinic  
I have a secret but it’s a story (oh)  
I came to kick off, they told me not yet (bruh)  
I have time to give you a lesson  
I don’t have time and I won’t stress you (sco)  

[Chorus]  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change (sco)  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun (oh)  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to make a change  
Victory (bruh) victory (sco)  
We’re here to have some fun
