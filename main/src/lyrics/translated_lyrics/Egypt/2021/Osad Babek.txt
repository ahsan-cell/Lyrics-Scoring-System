**Translated Lyrics:**

You’ve gone further down the road than the dream I once dreamed,  
It’s true that when we lose something, we understand its worth in time.  
I stayed scared and alone, with my pain laid bare before me,  
Like a child in your hands, you left him lost in fear.  
I pass by memories as if I’m walking on bare glass,  
And still, every time I imagine, I see you holding my shoulders.  
I’ll walk alone in the street, feeling your ghost on the storefronts,  
You’ve left me, and the night has turned against me,  
Leaving me with the sound of my sad song.

**[Chorus]**  
And the night I’m living now, I’m all alone,  
Is different from the nights I spent before your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the arms of life for your absence.  
And the night I’m living now, I’m all alone,  
Is different from the nights I spent before your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the arms of life for your absence.

**[Verse 2]**  
I close my eyes and imagine a time we’ll live again far away,  
And we’ll have grown, you and I, and our dimples will be wrinkles.  
The night stretches long, and I yearn for the embrace of old and your sighs,  
And I’m afraid if my life passes, I won’t die with my head on your hand.  
Still, I go everywhere and order two coffees too,  
How can my heart live while your ghost still chases it?  
I’ve become broken, and I won’t deny it, my love, my land, my country,  
There are men in this world who break easily from separation.

**[Chorus]**  
And the night I’m living now, I’m all alone,  
Is different from the nights I spent before your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the arms of life for your absence.  
And the night I’m living now, I’m all alone,  
Is different from the nights I spent before your door,  
The one who got used to crying in your embrace from this world,  
Now cries in the arms of life for your absence.
