**[Verse 1]**  
It seems like it’s not a simple matter,  
There’s betrayal and conversations involved.  
I stay up for hours,  
All of this is happening to me.  
I feel like I’ve started  
To become romantic and weak.  
Why has my sleep become so light?  
I used to sleep deeply,  
It seems like it’s not a simple matter,  
There’s betrayal and conversations involved.  
I stay up for hours,  
All of this is happening to me.  
I feel like I’ve started  
To become romantic and weak.  
Why has my sleep become so light?  
I used to sleep deeply.

**[Chorus]**  
Beauty surpasses words,  
You smile at me and how much do you take?  
I’d pay for the years to come,  
Just for you to return my greeting.  
I’m not being insincere, believe me,  
Feel me, talk to me.  
Even if it’s a strange topic,  
What I want is for you to understand me.  
I swear I’m a good man,  
I’m not flirting at all.  

**[Verse 2]**  
You might say this is impulsive,  
You might find it strange.  
Don’t walk away and leave me  
Before I finish my words.  
I saw you, my heart got lost,  
And that’s not normal at all.  
In the crowd, if you get lost,  
Just say goodbye to my heart.

**[Chorus]**  
Beauty surpasses words,  
You smile at me and how much do you take?  
I’d pay for the years to come,  
Just for you to return my greeting.  
I’m not being insincere, believe me,  
Feel me, talk to me.  
Even if it’s a strange topic,  
What I want is for you to understand me.  
I swear I’m a good man,  
I’m not flirting at all.  

**[Bridge]**  
I’m not flirting at all,  
Come on, I swear I’m a good man.

**[Chorus]**  
Beauty surpasses words,  
You smile at me and how much do you take?  
I’d pay for the years to come,  
Just for you to return my greeting.  
I’m not being insincere, believe me,  
Feel me, talk to me.  
Even if it’s a strange topic,  
What I want is for you to understand me.  
I swear I’m a good man,  
I’m not flirting at all.

**[Outro]**  
I'm telling you girl,  
I'm not trying to play with you here,  
I'm serious, hah, babe.  
A good man,  
A good man.  
I'm telling you girl,  
I'm serious.
