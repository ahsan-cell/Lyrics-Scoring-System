**Translated Lyrics:**

My friend called me and said, "Come on down, we're going out to have some fun."  
We sat down, he handed me the glass, I said, "No thanks, I don’t drink."  
I ordered juice, since I don’t drink,  
But there was no juice, so now I’m drinking.  
I see birds, and my head goes bam bam.

**[Chorus]**  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam,  
Bam bam,  
Bam bam,  
Bam bam.

**[Verse 2]**  
Hey everyone, I can’t find my phone,  
Hey everyone, it’s ringing over there, can someone get it for me?  
Hey everyone, the Ninja Turtles are calling me,  
Hey everyone, I think I messed up, wake me up.

**[Chorus]**  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam.

**[Verse 3]**  
Um, a lighter, can someone bring the lighter?  
Lighter, no one’s bringing the lighter.  
Hey everyone, someone lower the volume,  
I don’t know, I can’t even look at the clock.

**[Chorus]**  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam.

**[Verse 4]**  
My mind is numb, my face is glowing,  
I feel like an ocean, I have to roll up my sleeves.  
My legs are shaking, my body’s loosening up,  
Suddenly I found my heart going bam bam.

**[Chorus]**  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam.

**[Verse 5]**  
I’m sitting here, neither with me nor with anyone else, hey everyone,  
I see aliens and my eyes,  
And my eyes turned Japanese,  
And inside my head, there’s a world war going on, hitting bam bam.

**[Chorus]**  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam bam bam bam,  
Bam bam,  
Bam bam,  
Bam bam,  
Bam bam.
