(Exclusive on مهرجانات دوت كوم)
I saw you, a rising moon  
With cheeks so bright and bold  
Oh, sweetest girls of Kary  
Oh, strawberry of the neighborhood  
(Dj Saso remix)

[Hassan Shakosh]  
The girls' scent is high  
You turned my world upside down  
Everything precious is cheap for you  
Oh, you who enchanted me  
The hero's scent is wrapped  
And I still have much to see  
I'm coming to you, unashamed  
For you have truly captivated me  

[Omar Kamal]  
You take me gently  
Her beauty is extraordinary  
When she comes before me  
I die two hundred times  
I love no one but her  
And I want her to live for me  
Love is in the intention  
I want you, and you are free  

[Hassan Shakosh]  
Oh, you who occupy my thoughts  
Feel my fire now  
Oh, sweetest girls of Kary  
Oh, strawberry of the neighborhood  
I want you, my little darling  
My friend and my girl  
To see you, I make a million plans  

[Omar Kamal]  
That smile is a story  
Sugar in a cup  
And I tell you with my love  
Your love is enough for me  
I saw you, a rising moon  
With cheeks so bright and bold  
If the weather is cold  
Your embrace warms me

[Hassan Shakosh]  
You’re an angel, not a human  
In my arms, you find safety  
Oh, pomegranate seed  
You come to me from paradise  
The most beautiful sight for the eyes  
It’s just you, no one else  
If your dowry were millions  
I’d weigh you with money  

[Omar Kamal]  
More beautiful than the beautiful ones  
There’s no one like you  
Let your heart soften  
And we’ll be just fine  
From this world, I’ll take you  
Oh, the beauty of your cheeks  
Who are you compared to?  
A brand in beauty  

[Hassan Shakosh]  
You’re coming to me, coming to me  
You never leave my mind  
I want you to be the mother of my children  
And stay with me  
Oh, remedy for my sickness  
In my heart, you are my pulse  
I’ll spend all my savings  
And bring you gifts with it  

[Omar Kamal]  
That smile is a story  
Sugar in a cup  
And I tell you with my love  
Your love is enough for me  
I saw you, a rising moon  
With cheeks so bright and bold  
If the weather is cold  
Your embrace warms me
