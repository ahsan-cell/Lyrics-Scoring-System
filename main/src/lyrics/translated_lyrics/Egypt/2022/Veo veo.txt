**Translated Lyrics:**

I see, I see what you see, a little thing, and what could it be?  
It starts with "A," what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?  
Elephant, no, no, no, that's not it, no, no, no,  
That's not it, no, no, no, it’s not that way.  
With "A" we write love, with "A" we write goodbye,  
The joy of a friend and a whole lot more.

I see, I see what you see, a little thing, and what could it be?  
It starts with "E," what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?  
Town hall, no, no, no, that's not it, no, no, no,  
That's not it, no, no, no, it’s not that way.  
With "E" for emotion, we study expression,  
And singing this song, we find the truth.

I see, I see what you see, a little thing, and what could it be?  
It starts with "I," what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?  
Envy, no, no, no, that's not it, no, no, no,  
That's not it, no, no, no, it’s not that way.  
With "I," our dreams try to imagine,  
When unusual restlessness brings a childhood without malice.

I see, I see what you see, a little thing, and what could it be?  
It starts with "O," what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?  
School, no, no, no, that's not it, no, no, no,  
That's not it, no, no, no, it’s not that way.  
I forgot to observe that hating is hateful,  
That horror, though it starts with "H," is horror until the end.

I see, I see what you see, a little thing, and what could it be?  
It starts with "U," what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?  
Belly button, no, no, no, that's not it, no, no, no,  
That's not it, no, no, no, it’s not that way.  
With the union that "U" made, it unified a planet,  
And it joined universes with the "U" of unity.

I see, I see what you see, a little thing, and what could it be?  
It starts with "F," what could it be, what could it be, what could it be?  
Final, yes, yes, yes, that’s it, yes, yes, yes,  
Yes, yes, yes, that’s it, yes, yes, yes, the end has come.  
Cha cha cha.
