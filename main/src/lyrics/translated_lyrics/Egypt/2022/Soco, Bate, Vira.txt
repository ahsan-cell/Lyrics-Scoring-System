[Verse 1]  
You play with a friend  
You can even play alone  
It can be leg with the hand  
Or hand with the hand  
Who gets tangled gets caught  
Pay close attention  
Because everything needs to be quick  

[Verse 2]  
Punch, punch, closed fist  
Hit, hit, open hand  
If you switch, if you hit outside  
If you mess up, we make mistakes  
It's time to train  
Iâ€™ll go slow at first  
Because soon it will speed up  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn  

[Chorus]  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn  
Punch, punch, hit, hit  
Punch, punch, turn, turn  
Punch, hit, punch, turn  
Punch, hit and turn
