**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh light of the moon, return  
Rebel against the chains  
Oh light of life, be generous  
Woe to me, magic has taken hold of me  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  
(Oh festival, festival, festival)  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  

**[Verse 2]**  
Gently, your eyes quench the thirst of others  
From today, your path is pure and bright  
Gently, your eyes quench the thirst of others  
From today, your path is pure and bright  
From today, I’ll cast blame on your enemies  
If they declare war, I swear I’ll ignite it  
From today, I’ll cast blame on your enemies  
If they declare war, I swear I’ll ignite it  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  

**[Verse 3]**  
You, oh lady, lady, lady, without you there’s no fire  
You, in my night, night, night, without you there’s confusion  
Oh companion of my journey, my heart, heart, without you there’s no home  
You, oh lady, night, night, without you there’s confusion  
Your swaying waist feels like I’m at the mountain of Arafat*  
Between heaven and hell, oh daughter of my heart, oh  
My embrace is lost, mama  
I fought for safety  
I was the peace in your war  
What hurt me was the one who cut me off  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance  
Oh night and oh eyes, since you left, life has lost its charm  
Life, oh festival, come to me with a beautiful glance
