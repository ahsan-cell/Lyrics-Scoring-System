**Translated Lyrics:**

Who’s this weakling that stands beside us?  
Who is he? He neither lived nor existed.  
This summer will bear witness for us,  
Under the roof of our passion.

**[Verse 1]**  
If we’re going to be playful, let’s indulge,  
Walking on water, we won’t fall.  
Look at the sea, it’s enough for our play,  
Before things turn upside down.  
No, let’s see someone calm us down,  
Before this summer passes by.  
Oh Lord, may the shore fulfill,  
And settle with our passion.

**[Chorus]**  
Because the playfulness has ignited, it hasn’t burned in a while,  
And whoever hasn’t seen the moon rise should go and get a glimpse.  
Because the playfulness has ignited, it hasn’t burned in a while,  
And whoever hasn’t seen the moon rise should go and get a glimpse.

**[Verse 2]**  
We walk with the breeze as we please, igniting our summer without calming down,  
And in the morning we say, “Oh morning,” until the last night, let us live.  
And the night we spend in a late gathering, it delights us and doesn’t pass too quickly.  
And if the fire ignites, we won’t raise the flames, we’ll add more, not extinguish.  
If we don’t live this playfulness, then who will?

**[Chorus]**  
Because the playfulness has ignited, it hasn’t burned in a while,  
And whoever hasn’t seen the moon rise should go and get a glimpse.  
Because the playfulness has ignited, it hasn’t burned in a while,  
And whoever hasn’t seen the moon rise should go and get a glimpse.

**[Verse 3]**  
We are the ones who set the mood,  
And summer has ripened from our playfulness.  
Its sea and shore come together,  
Taking the cue from us.  
There’s no one like us around,  
With passion and charm.  
It ignited, and the vibe is sweet,  
So why shouldn’t we live this playfulness?

**[Chorus]**  
Because the playfulness has ignited, it hasn’t burned in a while,  
And whoever hasn’t seen the moon rise should go and get a glimpse.  
Because the playfulness has ignited, it hasn’t burned in a while,  
And whoever hasn’t seen the moon rise should go and get a glimpse.
