**Translated Lyrics:**

They asked me  
Oh my love, they asked me so many times  
Is there anyone more beautiful than you in my eyes?  
They asked me  
Oh my love, they asked me so many times  
Is there anyone more beautiful than you in my eyes?  
I said no, no, no  
Of course, there's no one sweeter  
I haven't found in this world  
Anyone as beautiful as you  

**[Chorus]**  
Your presence lifts me high  
Strong and you confirmed to me  
My luck came from the heavens  
The day you came close to me  
Your presence lifts me high  
Strong and you confirmed to me  
My luck came from the heavens  
The day you came close to me  

**[Verse 2]**  
Since my days  
I've loved you since my days  
And you make my days sweet  
Since my days  
I've loved you since my days  
And you make my days sweet  
With someone else,  
You forget life with them  
I mean you,  
I haven't found anyone like you, no  

**[Chorus]**  
Your presence lifts me high  
Strong and you confirmed to me  
My luck came from the heavens  
The day you came close to me  
Your presence lifts me high  
Strong and you confirmed to me  
My luck came from the heavens  
The day you came close to me  

**[Chorus]**  
Your presence lifts me high  
Strong and you confirmed to me  
My luck came from the heavens  
The day you came close to me  
Your presence lifts me high  
Strong and you confirmed to me  
My luck came from the heavens  
The day you came close to me
