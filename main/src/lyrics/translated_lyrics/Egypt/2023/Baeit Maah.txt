**Translated Lyrics:**

Since the day his eyes met mine,  
And I saw that beautiful smile of his,  
I dream of a day when he’ll be mine, and I’ll be his,  
And I wake up to find him, my love, beside me.  
Since the day his eyes met mine,  
And I saw that beautiful smile of his,  
I dream of a day when he’ll be mine, and I’ll be his,  
And I wake up to find him, my love, beside me.

**[Chorus]**  
And here it is,  
What’s in my dreams is happening right before me,  
My love is next to me in my arms tonight,  
By God, I’m with him now.  
He called,  
Joy gathered us, love called,  
It’s me and my love, and happiness is our third,  
And we’ve interpreted the dream.  
And here it is,  
What’s in my dreams is happening right before me,  
My love is next to me in my arms tonight,  
By God, I’m with him now.  
He called,  
Joy gathered us, love called,  
It’s me and my love, and happiness is our third,  
And we’ve interpreted the dream.

**[Verse 2]**  
How much I wish I could prolong it,  
The words "my love, oh my love," say them,  
Years of my life fade beside those words,  
Make me happy, promise to stretch it out.  
How much I wish I could prolong it,  
The words "my love, oh my love," say them,  
Years of my life fade beside those words,  
Make me happy, promise to stretch it out.

**[Chorus]**  
And here it is,  
What’s in my dreams is happening right before me,  
My love is next to me in my arms tonight,  
By God, I’m with him now.  
He called,  
Joy gathered us, love called,  
It’s me and my love, and happiness is our third,  
And we’ve interpreted the dream.  
Ah, and here it is,  
What’s in my dreams is happening right before me,  
My love is next to me in my arms tonight,  
By God, I’m with him now.  
He called,  
Joy gathered us, love called,  
It’s me and my love, and happiness is our third,  
And we’ve interpreted the dream.
