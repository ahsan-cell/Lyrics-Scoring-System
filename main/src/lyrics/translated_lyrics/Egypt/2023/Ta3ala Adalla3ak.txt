**Translated Lyrics:**

I’ve got you on my mind, let’s chill for a bit, just pass by and come down  
You’re above my thoughts, it’s my fault, our long argument has shaken me  
I’ve got you on my mind, let’s chill for a bit, just pass by and come down  
You’re above my thoughts, it’s my fault, our long argument has shaken me  

**[Chorus]**  
Come here, let me pamper you, tell me what’s stopping you?  
Being next to you won’t tire you, and you’ll love the place  
Come here, I swear to you, tell me who’s bothering you?  
If I were in your place, I’d never embarrass you  
Come here, let me pamper you, tell me what’s stopping you?  
Being next to you won’t tire you, and you’ll love the place  
Come here, I swear to you, tell me who’s bothering you?  
If I were in your place, I’d never embarrass you  

**[Verse 2]**  
Three times by the great, your status is high  
Our disagreements are an old story  
Three times by the great, your status is high  
Our disagreements are an old story  
I’m coming to you with pure intentions and a clear heart  

**[Verse 3]**  
No matter how much your lover strays, they can never betray  
Your place is in the darkness, in the depths of their eyes  
No matter how much your lover strays, they can never betray  
Your place is in the darkness, in the depths of their eyes  
Neither the bond has faded nor will you be belittled  

**[Chorus]**  
Come here, let me fix you up, tell me who’s confusing you?  
Believe me, I’ll serve you, one step at a time, I’ll understand you  
Come here, let me calm you, my love, and prepare you  
If I were in your place, I swear I’d beat you to it  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’ve got you on my mind, let’s chill for a bit, just pass by and come down  
You’re above my thoughts, it’s my fault, our long argument has shaken me  

**[Chorus]**  
Come here, let me pamper you, tell me what’s stopping you?  
Being next to you won’t tire you, and you’ll love the place  
Come here, I swear to you, tell me who’s bothering you?  
If I were in your place, I’d never embarrass you
