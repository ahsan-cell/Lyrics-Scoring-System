**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
I’m not showing him,  
What I’m planning for him.  
Silent and swearing to him,  
But not saying why I’m silent.  
Let him see with his own eyes,  
What I’m intending to do.  
I’ll make him fear his own shadow,  
When I disappear for a day from his sight.  
I’m not showing him,  
What I’m planning for him.  
Silent and swearing to him,  
But not saying why I’m silent.  
Let him see with his own eyes,  
What I’m intending to do.  
I’ll make him fear his own shadow,  
When I disappear for a day from his sight.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m grateful that I met him,  
And I endured him, my heart, for so long.  
He comes to me, and I let it pass,  
And he drives me along as well.  
Because of all his actions, I tell him enough,  
You and I have become a story for everyone.  
A tale on every tongue.  
He’ll come to appease me,  
I’ll say, “Of course, we can’t do without each other.”  
And I’ll let him try once,  
So that the next time he won’t do it again.  
And it’s less about being stubborn,  
And more about drifting apart.  
We either come back together or we don’t.

**[Verse 2]**  
Let him search for me,  
Every now and then, and not find me.  
Let him tire a little,  
And dream of me without seeing me.  
I won’t run after him again,  
Because I’ve been defeated with him.  
And for myself, I’ll train myself,  
From now on, not to miss him.  
Let him search for me,  
Every now and then, and not find me.  
Let him tire a little,  
Dream of me without seeing me.  
I won’t run after him again,  
Because I’ve been defeated with him.  
And for myself, I’ll train myself,  
From now on, not to miss him.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m grateful that I met him,  
And I endured him, my heart, for so long.  
He comes to me, and I let it pass,  
And he drives me along as well.  
Because of all his actions, I tell him enough,  
You and I have become a story for everyone.  
A tale on every tongue.  
He’ll come to appease me,  
I’ll say, “Of course, we can’t do without each other.”  
And I’ll let him try once,  
So that the next time he won’t do it again.  
And it’s less about being stubborn,  
And more about drifting apart.  
We either come back together or we don’t.

**[Outro]**  
I’m not showing him,  
Ah, I’m not showing him.
