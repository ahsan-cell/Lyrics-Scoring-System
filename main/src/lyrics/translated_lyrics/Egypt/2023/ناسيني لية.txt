**Translated Lyrics:**

This is my last moment in the sun  
My thoughts are fading away  
(My thoughts are fading away)  
And all that I am and was yesterday  
Is about to change  
(Is about to change)  

Perhaps I will finally find  
A resolution to my wandering  
I will bask in the sun and rest  
Closer to God  

Perhaps I will finally find  
A resolution to my wandering  
I will bask in the sun and rest  
Closer to God  

My life has flowed like a dry riverbed  
Death will surely come for me -  
A pillow of gold  

My life has flowed like a dry riverbed  
Death will surely come for me -  
A pillow of gold  

This is my last moment in the sun  
This is a moment of pure joy  
(pure joy)  
I have nothing left to lose or gain  
As everything has already been written  
(As everything has already been written)  

Perhaps I will finally find  
A resolution to my wandering  
I will bask in the sun and rest  
Closer to God  

Perhaps I will finally find  
A resolution to my wandering  
I will bask in the sun and rest  
Closer to God  

My life has flowed like a dry riverbed  
Death will surely come for me -  
A pillow of gold  

My life has flowed like a dry riverbed  
Death will surely come for me -  
A pillow of gold  

And when I walk hand in hand with the angel  
My son, don’t you cry  
(My son, don’t you cry too much over me)  
I wish that fortune will shine upon you  
For it has forgotten me  
(For it has forgotten me)
