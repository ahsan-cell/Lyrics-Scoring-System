**Translated Lyrics:**

When we go and travel to a distant place  
When we enter a new love story  
When we gather for a joyful occasion  
We sing  
When we soar with joy to another world  
When life gets tight and we suffer  
When we disconnect from this world for a moment  
We sing  

[Before the Chorus]  
We will still live and see so much more  
We will live under any circumstances  
We will still live and see so much more  
Let’s live, come on, let’s live  

[Chorus]  
We will sing again and again  
And we’ll dance away our sorrows  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  
We will sing again and again  
And we’ll dance away our sorrows  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  

[Second Verse]  
We’re all in this together, from confusion to confusion  
Carrying our hearts with so many burdens  
So we don’t believe it and we break the frown  
And we sing  
Like the sea, life is our ship  
We search for the shore that will anchor us  
And we look for something to help us forget  
And we sing  

[Before the Chorus]  
We will still live and see so much more  
We will live under any circumstances  
We will still live and see so much more  
Let’s live, come on, let’s live  

[Chorus]  
We will sing again and again  
And we’ll dance away our sorrows  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  
We will sing again and again  
And we’ll dance away our sorrows  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness  
Oh world, you’re crazy in your madness
