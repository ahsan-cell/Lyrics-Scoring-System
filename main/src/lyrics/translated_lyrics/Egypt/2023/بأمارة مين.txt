**Translated Lyrics:**

You come saying, "Why not open a door that's been closed for years?"  
Sorry, I have no solutions in hand that could please you.  
By whose authority is anyone better here for even a moment?  
It's heavy on my heart to breathe the air that flies around you.

**[Chorus]**  
If you're coming back as a human,  
Find yourself another topic.  
Why return to the one who hurt me?  
What do I owe you?  
Don't stir up my pain,  
Your time has already been wasted.  
I can't find my heart out in the street,  
To throw it away.  
If you're coming back as a human,  
Find yourself another topic.  
Why return to the one who hurt me?  
What do I owe you?  
Don't stir up my pain,  
Your time has already been wasted.  
I can't find my heart out in the street,  
To throw it away.

**[Verse 2]**  
Finish it alone,  
You threw my heart far from yours.  
I'm not being harsh on you,  
Call it that I'm catching up and waking up.  
And I'm not like before,  
I'll walk away and come back to you once more.  
My heart and mind are silent now; I've finally spoken to them.

**[Chorus]**  
If you're coming back as a human,  
Find yourself another topic.  
Why return to the one who hurt me?  
What do I owe you?  
Don't stir up my pain,  
Your time has already been wasted.  
I can't find my heart out in the street,  
To throw it away.  
If you're coming back as a human,  
Find yourself another topic.  
What do I owe you?
