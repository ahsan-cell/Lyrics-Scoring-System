**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, oh, oh, oh, my eye  
Oh night, oh eye  
Oh night, oh eye  
Oh eye  

**[Verse 1: Ahmed Saad and Ruby]**  
Oh my beloved  
I've finished my games with you  
You're beautiful, and my flaw is my flaw  
I weaken in front of beauty, beauty  
Oh, how beautiful it is  
My little heart, what's wrong?  
It turned upside down, its nature and state, what's wrong?  
I'm falling behind you, my journey, my journey  

**[Chorus: Ahmed Saad and Ruby]**  
Oh nights  
Forgive my haste  
This precious one is like the moon and my delight  
Sing me a song of my beloved, and I danced with him  
Oh nights  
The sweet one is up high  
And my delight, the world is making me happy  
Sing me a song of my beloved, and I danced with him  

**[Verse 2: Ahmed Saad and Ruby]**  
At your door  
I stand, a victim at your door  
I'm at your service, my dear, what's wrong?  
Why the teasing, oh master, oh master?  
On my mind  
Don't leave my thoughts for a day  
Your name is high to me  
I've memorized it completely, completely  

**[Chorus: Ahmed Saad and Ruby]**  
Oh nights  
Forgive my haste  
This precious one is like the moon and my delight  
Sing me a song of my beloved, and I danced with him  
Oh nights  
The sweet one is up high  
And my delight, the world is making me happy  
Sing me a song of my beloved, and I danced with him  
Oh nights  
Forgive my haste  
This precious one is like the moon and my delight  
Sing me a song of my beloved, and I danced with him  
Oh nights  
The sweet one is up high  
And my delight, the world is making me happy  
Sing me a song of my beloved, and I danced with him
