**Translated Lyrics:**

And keep me in your thoughts,  
And if possible, don’t hate me.  
Sometimes we lose things,  
Because we want to let them live.  
Put yourself in my place for a day,  
Close your eyes, follow your heart, and see why I’m suffering,  
From those who sell out and those who take my soul away,  
Wanting to take another piece.  
Put yourself in my place for a day,  
And then tell me.

**[Chorus]**  
After the words that end with goodbye, what’s left for me?  
Only sleepless nights while you’re in my shadow.  
I complain to myself, don’t know what’s wrong with me and what’s coming,  
That you walked away and forgot, and I’m left alone.

**[Verse 2]**  
Look through my eyes at a world,  
Different from what’s on your mind.  
Put yourself in my place for a day,  
And point out where your safety lies.  
Tell me how you found yourself,  
After you closed your door.  
Put yourself in my place for a day,  
And then show me from where you are.

**[Chorus]**  
After the words that end with goodbye, what’s left for me?  
Only sleepless nights while you’re in my shadow.  
I complain to myself, don’t know what’s wrong with me and what’s coming,  
That you walked away and forgot, and I’m left alone.

**[Verse 3]**  
After you, I still talk about you; the words haven’t changed.  
Driving stubbornly away, night and day, I can’t sleep.  
Still in my words, I say it will rain,  
I’m neither forgetting you nor preoccupied.  
Either find me a path where you can be, or find me solutions.

**[Chorus]**  
After the words that end with goodbye, what’s left for me?  
Only sleepless nights while you’re in my shadow.  
I complain to myself, don’t know what’s wrong with me and what’s coming,  
That you walked away and forgot, and I’m left alone.  
After the words that end with goodbye, what’s left for me?  
Only sleepless nights while you’re in my shadow.  
I complain to myself, don’t know what’s wrong with me and what’s coming,  
That you walked away and forgot, and I’m left alone.
