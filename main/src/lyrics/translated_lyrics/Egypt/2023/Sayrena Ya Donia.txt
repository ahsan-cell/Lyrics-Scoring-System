**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1**  
Heavier than the mountains,  
My shoulder's bent, my back is strained.  
Suddenly it comes, a possibility,  
But it brings with it a thousand million questions.  
Is this a world of wellness or a path that's clear?  
Is the road moving forward or is it doomed?  
Is this the answer, or does it have an owner?  
This is our choice, meaning our state, or has it always been forced upon us?

**Chorus**  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world, oh world, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.

**Verse 2**  
Believe me, if I could,  
I would carry you in my veins.  
I would shine just to bind you,  
I would break a stone and pass you through.  
I would pick the best of this world for you,  
I would be your star in its night.  
I would lift the burdens of the universe with my hands,  
And hold you in my arms, where your fears find safety.

**Chorus**  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world, oh world, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.

**Verse 3**  
Some are in one valley, others in another,  
And where are we at this hour?  
It's hard to reach them, or is it normal?  
Who in this world has ever had a constant state?  
Tomorrow might bring my kind,  
To be on my side, not against me.  
And if they don't come, they won't pass by,  
And surely our journey will bring us together one day.

**Chorus**  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world, oh world, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.

**Verse 4**  
It's a push and it brings a push,  
Don't tire yourself, don’t say no.  
Accept and stand firm, your fate is a struggle,  
And the road needs a brave heart, not just words.  
Step by step, and tomorrow will reveal,  
Sometimes it’s tough, sometimes it flows.  
You know, you know your essence,  
From the beginning of the story,  
One day in paradise, one day in fire.

**Chorus**  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.  
Guide us, oh world, take us along, oh world.
