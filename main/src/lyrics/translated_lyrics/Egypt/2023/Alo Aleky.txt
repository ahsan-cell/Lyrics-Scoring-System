**Translated Lyrics:**

And I’ll sing you ballads, I’ll tell tales of you,  
How, my love, despite the distance, there’s no space between us too?  
We said we’d part one day, and then we drifted for a while,  
Yet despite the distance, sometimes I return, longing with a smile.  

**[Chorus]**  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room for me inside,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time as your guide.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten their own past,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time so fast.  

**[Verse 2]**  
And if it were up to my heart, I’d long for you suddenly,  
No matter what they say, I see you differently.  
Your eyes enchant me when they meet mine, oh what a sight!  
Where have you been all this time, my sweetest angel, my light?  

**[Chorus]**  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room for me inside,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time as your guide.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten their own past,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time so fast.  

**[Verse 3]**  
Here’s my state with you, staying up late for your sake,  
The stars of the night send you greetings, for old times’ sake.  
Here’s my state with you, staying up late for your sake,  
The stars of the night send you greetings, for old times’ sake.  

**[Chorus]**  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room for me inside,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time as your guide.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten their own past,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time so fast.  
They say your eyes are cold, there’s no room for me inside,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time as your guide.  
They say you’ve become someone who’s forgotten their own past,  
Maybe you loved, then left, and forgot with time so fast.
