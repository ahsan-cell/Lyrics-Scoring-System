**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Oh, winds of life, you blow  
Always bringing what I don’t desire  
And what the years have brought me  
Is different from what I told myself  
My heart seeks its remedy  
And those who hurt it are closest to me  
This wound teaches me  
And it's hard to silence the pain  
To emerge from the past unscathed  
And it's tough when I go to sleep  
I can't keep revisiting the old  
It turned out to be a costly mark  
I learned a lesson deep inside  
And I'm still learning  

**[Verse 2]**  
Focus, my heart, on what's to come  
And a thousand thanks to those who sold  
Not even preserving a cup of tea  
Goodbye to 300 farewells  
And those who met us can’t fit  
In the farewell space we share  
Our feelings aren’t a game  
Don’t dwell on what’s gone  
Stay focused, my heart, on what’s useful  
Grow from any memories  
Just concentrate on the new  
We must divide the spaces  
Between who is close and who is far  
The math isn’t hard  

**[Verse 3]**  
I’ve rejoiced for hours and hours  
And tasted many things  
I’ve lived through years and years  
And built from the past mere crumbs  
From the beloved, a sad letter  
And questions without answers  
Confusion after confusion  
Even happiness comes and goes  
Even love is give and take  
And everything is one big pile  
Time throws out punchlines  
And as usual, I fast and fast  
And fill my hunger with memories  
And spill them into stories  

**[Verse 4]**  
In the end, oh stubborn time  
Everyone has moved on, but I’m the only one  
Who followed a mirage  
And who started anew  
Everyone saw what was behind  
I counted the drinks alone, as usual  
There’s no one left but me in this place  
Nothing remains of what was  
Only the pain of the past  
And a whisper of memories in my ears  
I obeyed my fate when it said  
Be patient for everything that calls  
Oh luck, what will you call?  

**[Conclusion]**  
There’s no one left but me in this place  
Nothing remains of what was  
Only the pain of the past  
And a whisper of memories in my ears  
I obeyed my fate when it said  
Be patient for everything that calls  
Oh luck, what will you call?
