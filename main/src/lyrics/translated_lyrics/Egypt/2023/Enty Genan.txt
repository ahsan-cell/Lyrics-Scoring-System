**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Everything's normal, except for you, the rising sun  
Everything's beautiful, but you are simply stunning  
I think I’ve fallen for you, oops, be careful  
Passing by and above  
You’re the moon in a calm night  
You’re a beautiful and clear mood  
Your beauty is uniquely tailored  
Full of grace and taste  

**[Chorus]**  
No, you’re just insane  
A sun drawn by an artist  
Your eyes are Arabic too  
What now? My mind is going to fly  
Your eyes pull me in  
With a glance that captured my heart  
A divine beauty, no, no, it’s not magic  
Captivating, a star among the crowd  
No, you’re just insane  
A sun drawn by an artist  
Your eyes are Arabic too  
What now? My mind is going to fly  
Your eyes pull me in  
With a glance that captured my heart  
A divine beauty, no, no, it’s not magic  
Captivating, a star among the crowd  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’re in winter, Paris, Europe  
Your vibe is sweeter than the Maldives, oh wow  
This beauty isn’t light, it’s a blast  
Where did you come from?  
Your air revives the spirit, so pure  
Your smile makes the morning warm  
Your love is what I’ve anchored my heart on  
It’s what I dreamed of  

**[Chorus]**  
No, you’re just insane  
A sun drawn by an artist  
Your eyes are Arabic too  
What now? My mind is going to fly  
Your eyes pull me in  
With a glance that captured my heart  
A divine beauty, no, no, it’s not magic  
Captivating, a star among the crowd  
No, no, you’re just insane  
A sun drawn by an artist  
Your eyes are Arabic too  
What now? My mind is going to fly  
Your eyes pull me in  
With a glance that captured my heart  
A divine beauty, no, no, it’s not magic  
Captivating, a star among the crowd  

**[Bridge]**  
(Everything's normal, everything's normal)  
Everything's normal, except for you, the rising sun  
(You, you, you)  
(You’re the moon in a calm night)  
You’re the moon in a calm night  
You’re a beautiful and clear mood  
Your beauty is uniquely tailored  
Full of grace and taste  

**[Outro]**  
My heart is captured  
No, no, it’s not magic (everything's normal)  
No, no, you’re just insane  
No, no, you’re just insane (everything's normal)
