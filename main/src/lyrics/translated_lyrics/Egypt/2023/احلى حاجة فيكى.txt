**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Do you know what the best thing about you is?  
You make anything beautiful when your eyes come into view.  
What a moon, what can compare to you?  
Come here, let me tell you the best thing about you.  
Or do you understand my meaning and what I’m thinking?  
In you, I found what I’ve always dreamed of.

[Chorus]  
Nights, let’s go!  
God willing, I’ll die for your love, God willing.  
This love is too much for me, I swear.  
What more could I wish for?  
Ah, let’s go! God willing, I’ll die for your love, God willing.  
This love is too much for me, I swear.  
What more could I wish for?

[Verse 2]  
No one has this innocence,  
And I don’t have anyone as precious as you.  
Everything I have is yours, don’t deny it.  
Your eyes, my heart, my mind, my soul, my life—  
These are all yours; I won’t take them back from my life.  
And until the last day of my life.

[Chorus]  
Let’s go!  
God willing, I’ll die for your love, God willing.  
This love is too much for me, I swear.  
What more could I wish for? Ah,  
Let’s go! God willing, I’ll die for your love, God willing.  
This love is too much for me, I swear.  
What more could I wish for?  
Let’s go! God willing, I’ll die for your love, God willing.  
This love is too much for me, I swear.  
What more could I wish for?
