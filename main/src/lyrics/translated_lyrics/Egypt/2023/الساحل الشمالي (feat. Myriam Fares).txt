**English Translation:**

And you pass by my left side  
You’ve driven me crazy, the whole sea  
In the North Coast  
Oh dark-skinned one, what’s wrong with you and me?  
Let me sunbathe in my state  
And don’t occupy my heart  
My heart is still empty

I was walking in my own world  
Asking your uncle Ghabashi  
Is the apricot not coming?  
He said just catch it  
I asked Ashoklata  
He replied with nonsense  
He told me there’s only potatoes  
Well, I don’t want cake

By God, and for your father’s life  
No, don’t take me into this mess  
I’m going to the boat  
Lest we get delayed  
I’m still coming back  
From the fruit vendor  
The Lebanese apples  
They say they’re all gone  
Wait until June  
You’ll find me everywhere  
Hey, you guy with the cart  
Take me because I’m lost

The weather is really nice  
Shall we just open a cold drink?  
From my side, my request is well-known  
And ask the shark about it  
Your eyes at sunset  
Are a source of inspiration  
Just take it, oh honey  
And let’s skip the movies  
Yellow, oh beauty of the car  
What model is it?  
Oh silly one, is this the chest of kindness  
Or 100 Van Damme?

The heart of the lover is longing  
In the misty haze  
Your melodies stuck in my mind  
Tatata-tatata  
Descending, just barely from the plane  
And I found people collapsing  
They just saw the glasses  
No one saw the tattoo  
Tatata-tatata  
Tatata-tatata  
Tatata-tatata  
Tatata-tatata

How can a breeze in the afternoon  
Change my path?  
Cross the borders of my longing  
And kill me in my own home  
I feel my heart singing  
And love has given me a ring  
They say Egypt is beautiful  
No, Egypt is truly a paradise

I was walking in my own world  
Asking your uncle Ghabashi  
Is the apricot not coming?  
He said just catch it  
I asked Ashoklata  
He replied with nonsense  
He told me there’s only potatoes  
Well, I don’t want cake

By God, and for your father’s life  
No, don’t take me into this mess  
I’m going to the boat  
Lest we get delayed  
I’m still coming back  
From the fruit vendor  
The Lebanese apples  
They say they’re all gone  
Wait until June  
You’ll find me everywhere  
Hey, you guy with the cart  
Take me because I’m lost

The weather is really nice  
Shall we just open a cold drink?  
From my side, my request is well-known  
And ask the shark about it

Your melodies stuck in my mind  
Tatata-tatata  
Descending, just barely from the plane  
And I found people collapsing  
They just saw the glasses  
No one saw the tattoo  
Tatata-tatata  
Tatata-tatata  
Tatata-tatata  
Tatata-tatata
