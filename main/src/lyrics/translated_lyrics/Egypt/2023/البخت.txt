**Translated Lyrics:**

**(Chorus)**
My eyes are seriously on her (my eyes are seriously on her)  
And she’s heavy, not just a burden, my magic evaporates (and she doesn’t think of me)  
And she doesn’t think of me, she never considered it (and she doesn’t think of me)  
I’m preoccupied with her, my mind isn’t mine anymore (and she doesn’t think of me)  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’m playing with fate (and then?)  
I asked her and she rejected me  
I was surprised, where’s my dignity?  
Darling, I’m laughing at my own failure  
Man, I was steady but she shook me  
What’s past was my magic  
She doesn’t think of me when my name comes up  
I’m preoccupied with her, my mind isn’t mine anymore  
She said things before she saw me  
She knows I’m hard to understand  
My words are rough and unmeasured  
Or maybe she loves someone else and her mind is occupied  
I haven’t seen her, and no one can blame me  
An innocent angel or am I deceived?  
Is she nervous or am I shaken?  
Or did someone hurt her, and everyone’s rejected?  

**(Chorus)**  
What’s the story? Darling, help me  
Those who hurt you so many times, darling, leave me  
I’ll make the garden roses and candles  
Singing for her in a loud voice  
What’s the story? Darling, help me  
Those who hurt you so many times, darling, leave me  
Can I forget a past full of tears?  
Or can’t I leave you in pain?  

**[Bridge]**  
Did you enchant me or did I enchant you?  
(Did you enchant me or did I enchant you?)  
And your eyes don’t need to charm me  
(And your eyes don’t need to charm me)  
And you didn’t want to bring me back, but you did  
(You didn’t want to bring me back, but you did)  
And you forgot me, and in my story, you trapped me  

**[Verse 2]**  
By God, I fell, thinking of you a lot, my mind is occupied with you  
And I feel sorry for myself while writing sweet words to you  
Far from my eyes, oh my eyes, with someone else and not happy  
I’m wasting my life, my love, loving you unconditionally  

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t expect false promises from me  
I’ve grown beyond anything guaranteed  
My words match what I have with me  
In love, I don’t wait for a return  
Gently on my broken heart  
The problem is that it’s tangled in you  
Who chose what your eyes have done?  
It’s not my fault; I woke up placed here  

**(Chorus)**  
What’s the story? Darling, help me  
Those who hurt you so many times, darling, leave me  
I’ll make the garden roses and candles  
Singing for her in a loud voice  
What’s the story? Darling, help me  
Those who hurt you so many times, darling, leave me  
Can I forget a past full of tears?  
Or can’t I leave you in pain?  
What’s the story? Darling, help me  
Those who hurt you so many times, darling, leave me  
I’ll make the garden roses and candles  
Singing for her in a loud voice  
What’s the story? Darling, help me  
Those who hurt you so many times, darling, leave me  
Can I forget a past full of tears?  
Or can’t I leave you in pain?  

**[Outro]**  
Oh night, oh night  
Oh night, oh night  
Oh night, oh night
