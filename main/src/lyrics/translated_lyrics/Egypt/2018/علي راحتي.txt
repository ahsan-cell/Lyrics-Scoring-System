**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**  
Welcome back, your hearts are heavy  
Starting with a burst if your longing brings you  
You've made me pay for this headache  
Growing in my head, night and Mozart  

**[Chorus]**  
I walk the world at my own pace  
On my palms, at my own pace  
Me, fame, and my interests  
Leave it in the unknown, I won’t clarify  
If you don’t understand, I won’t explain  
I come to finish, I won’t overdo it  
With my strength, I shake you, I won’t make a sound  
I’m in the game, I won’t be sidelined  

**[Verse 1]**  
We brought it from the bottom to the top, we’ll reach the sky  
Forget the bread and salt, you won’t feel full  
So many times I’ve been a metaphor, fire on the world  
Worries pile up like a mountain, so we live on hope  
Suddenly, you become a statue  
Suddenly, you tell me I’m sculpting you  
Don’t come telling me I’ve hurt you  
I’ll make you a star, I’ll fix you up  
Just a cut, but I’ll stitch you  
Not lacking in drama and noise  
We’ve struggled through what we’re in  
Straightforward, we’ve seen the mess  
My head’s closed with a crown  
You’re a hundred percent color  
You open your head with an axe  
I haven’t taken a day off from you  
It’s a mess, I’m stumbling  
Lost the fight, so I’m mumbling  
Can’t close the safe  
Bring them with me to the shore  

**[Chorus]**  
I walk the world at my own pace  
On my palms, at my own pace  
Me, fame, and my interests  
Leave it in the unknown, I won’t clarify  
If you don’t understand, I won’t explain  
I come to finish, I won’t overdo it  
With my strength, I shake you, I won’t make a sound  
I’m in the game, I won’t be sidelined  

**[Verse 2]**  
I rush to spend all my money while I’m alive  
But who’s paying for what’s coming?  
Everything’s clear, everything’s obvious  
A person’s name isn’t small  
We come with effort  
You come with luck  
I want the code from you  
Sleep, I don’t want movement  
This work isn’t finished  
Why do you love to play games?  
And you play us for fools  
We thought the scoundrel had honor  
Before I cross, I leave a mark  
Keep your history in the trash  
Show me your back, goodbye  
Go home, count your losses  
If you’re not scared, I’ll say “breathe”  
With your curves, I’ll say “ugh”  
Used to coming back to Cyber  
You die because you’re white  
Your hand down, your hand up  
Your hand’s long, you’re a thief  
You’re half a quarter, half half  
Your eye’s on my account, look look  
Five on us, salty in your eye  
You fell from me, in God’s name, in God’s name  
I’ll say it once, repeat repeat  
My colleague told you “out out”  
You’re a star here, meaning Delta  
I’m a star outside the continent, continent  
Versace spicy, hot hot  
Your completeness is laughter and riddles  
You’re friends and brothers in the plate of chaos  
In the disaster next to Malta  
None of you can support me  
So why are you acting like bosses?  
Touch the wire, I’m starting a company  
You’re burning the stomach while you’re tearing the liver  
People raise a glass, you raise six  
Forgot yourself and forgot the path  
I have branches, I’ve got a thousand accounts  
I have people who won’t let me have enemies  
I searched the scene and moved it to parties  
Stay with your notebook, it has no games  

**[Chorus]**  
I walk the world at my own pace  
On my palms, at my own pace  
Me, fame, and my interests  
Leave it in the unknown, I won’t clarify  
If you don’t understand, I won’t explain  
I come to finish, I won’t overdo it  
With my strength, I shake you, I won’t make a sound  
I’m in the game, I won’t be sidelined
