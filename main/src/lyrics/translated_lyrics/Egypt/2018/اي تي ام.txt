**Translated Lyrics:**

**Chorus:**
I don’t want a doctor, I want an ATM  
Wegz drives the madness in the BM  
My buddy, let today pass (let it pass)  
Let it pass, let your day go by  

**Verse 1:**
I can’t hear you, it’s hard to break me  
Fame like Sylvester Stallone  
A million minus a quarter gather around me (just a million)  
One, two, three cheer for me (uno)  
Come after me, I’m always in the booth  
My head’s tough, I don’t follow the old ways  
No one knows you, but your friend is famous  
For you, I’ll give her my number, not just a photo  

**Chorus 2:**
Teddy bears forming a Toy Story gang  
I’m the one riding Nanna now, this is my turn  
The players in the stadium, you’re in the garden  
The kids are having fun and taking their story  
Teddy bears forming a Toy Story gang  
I’m the one riding Nanna now, this is my turn  
The players in the stadium, you’re in the garden  
The kids are having fun and taking their stories  

**Verse 2:**
I don’t see it as a race, there’s no bitterness  
Cold, but your friend heated up the temperature  
Captains without tickets on the plane  
An informal bank comes, you’re pocket money from dad  
What are you talking to me about? A joker, two-faced  
You’re the first gear because I’m coming for you  
I’m the sixth, 250 KM per hour  
In the shower, they’re exaggerating about you  
For my city, I’m for the people  
Five of us, me and the singles  
Salty in your eyes, envious, lazy  
A rising star, a shuttle, a rocket  
To be or not to be, the key is in my hand  
AG, if my buddy Totti and  
We see you as a man, you see yourself as Gigi  
They treat you like a man, we see you as Gigi  

**Bridge:**
Ah, everything you wish for, Dandy Mall  
Shh, shh, I don’t want to hear a sound  
The whole party is empty inside  
On my account, shots of Dettol  
The secret of my stardom is that I’m confrontational  
We form a circle, amusement  
The world is a distraction while I’m sleeping on my ears  

**Chorus 2:**
Teddy bears forming a Toy Story gang  
I’m the one riding Nanna now, this is my turn  
The players in the stadium, you’re in the garden  
The kids are having fun and taking their story  
Teddy bears forming a Toy Story gang  
I’m the one riding Nanna now, this is my turn  
The players in the stadium, you’re in the garden  
The kids are having fun and taking their stories  

**Chorus 1:**
I don’t want a doctor, I want an ATM  
Wegz drives the madness in the BM  
My buddy, let today pass  
Let it pass, let your day go by
