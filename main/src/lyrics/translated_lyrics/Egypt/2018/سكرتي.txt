**Translated Lyrics:**

**Chorus:**
Where are we going? How far are we walking?  
We’re mingling with the men, eating what’s lawful.  
On my bed, I flip through sorrows, wounded and in pain,  
And in my head, everyone belongs to me; I am the public wealth.

**[Verse 1]**  
I drank from the bitter cup, who will pay the price?  
We’re exhausted, overflowing, but our hands reach for the sky.  
How far are we walking? Where are we headed?  
The world hates love, tearing lovers apart.  
Many eyes are on me,  
They don’t like the sight.  
Under the blue, there’s a surge,  
I know how to take a step.  
A week has passed, we’ve heated up,  
A month has gone by, and we’re still in shape.  
I’ll be a colleague above my head,  
Even if there’s just one left in the box, I’ll drink it.

**[Chorus]**  
Where are we going? How far are we walking?  
We’re mingling with the men, eating what’s lawful.  
On my bed, I flip through sorrows, wounded and in pain,  
And in my head, everyone belongs to me; I am the public wealth.

**[Verse 2]**  
My friend, there’s no one else but us,  
Seven billion, and I’m alone.  
The rest of my friends are us,  
Look into my eyes; these people are us.  
We’ve grown up and become wild to deal with people,  
The treacherous make us wild, spreading both tall and wide.  
We don’t like those who boast,  
Poor for God, and I’m waiting for it.  
With God’s help, from a glance,  
I’ll dive into the depths of my eyes.

**[Chorus]**  
Where are we going? How far are we walking?  
We’ve escaped from the shark’s tooth, not from the mark.  
Where are we going? How far are we walking?  
We’ve escaped from the shark’s tooth, not from the mark.  
My friend, there’s no one like us; forget equality.  
Count how many eyes there are; I’m anxious about the views.  
Where are we going? How far are we walking?  
We’ve escaped from the shark’s tooth, not from the mark.  
My friend, there’s no one like us; forget equality.  
Count how many eyes there are; I’m anxious about the views.

**[Verse 3]**  
I’m always lost in the path,  
My friend, life is passing by.  
A year has gone by, and this is still here,  
Remote, waiting for me to hand it over.  
My friend, we’ve grown old and weakened,  
Pain returned to me in the mulberry.  
We grew up in the market,  
We slept and woke up as stars.  
I can’t live with reality,  
I can’t flatter the world.  
I want to finish on the shore,  
And you’re half your life on the screen.  
In your head, they control,  
In your rights, they make excuses.  
In war, they fill themselves,  
And they doubt us.  
How far are we walking? Where are we going?  
You’ll save me if you disappoint me and kill me with the share.  
You’re my enemies; follow my films.  
I gather my pieces and chase my dreams.  
Baby, tonight I come with my longings,  
My friend, let me know the secret, the secret, and wait for me.  
What, what, what, what, and wait for me.

**[Chorus]**  
Where are we going? How far are we walking?  
We’ve mingled with the men, eating what’s lawful.  
And in my head, everyone belongs to me; I am the public wealth.
