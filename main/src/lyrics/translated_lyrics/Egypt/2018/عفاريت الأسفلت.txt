**[Chorus]**  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?

**[Intro]**  
Where's my dad, in which direction does he come?  
Kids, I’ll bring them, take them away.  
Wearing a traditional robe, I’ll celebrate in it.  
Kids, I’ll bring them, take them away.  
I’m angry but unaware, it didn’t come easy.  
Your minds are closed, your thoughts are stuck.  
But we’re in the work that makes it happen.

**[Refrain]**  
Don’t mention them, they’re lurking around,  
The asphalt spirits that disturb you.  
You’re just heads, not thinking at all,  
If I let out a sigh from beside you,  
I’ll open my mouth and come out with a roar.  
And there’s no donkey among you worth my time.  
Oh girls of envy, you’ve all gathered jealousy,  
Not equal to the spirit that you summon.

**[Verse 1]**  
It wasn’t necessary,  
Less than you is not a crisis.  
Easy and not worth it,  
I’m not backing down, I won’t be dismissed.  
So don’t remind me,  
I’m not in need of you.  
I don’t gather your names,  
We lost early, the cutting crew.  
A man on you and on principle,  
What’s up, sheep?  
From the trench, I raise the light.  
And to forget, I’ll lift a few glasses.  
A donkey is stubborn and unseen,  
Every time I think of you, I come to ruin you.  
And I leave you often because I forget you.  
I don’t hang out with a lying man,  
A sentence that doesn’t fit, a lying man.  
The capital’s watchmen,  
Our attacks are shocking.  
Rashed in Al-Asafra, a storm,  
No affection, just chaos.  
My brother Rahma is traveling,  
Six in your face,  
And five in Cairo.  
Even though I’m not from here,  
The bike is sexy, our guard is raining.  
My colleague is known, first name Maki,  
And what’s the end? I won’t plant my foot.  
This is a muddy job, big as my name.  
They stick to me like glue,  
I don’t chase after a bitch nor beg for a penny,  
Nor walk crooked, a driver with a twist.  
Don’t you listen to Wegz? Don’t you have the internet?  
I’m proud of my fame, not envious,  
And it doesn’t shake, what’s written is written.  
Without asking, I’ll search and burn,  
You don’t have any explosives, all is done.  
But we stopped seeing,  
And without thinking, you have no respect.  
My colleague, we’ve erased each other, the circle is complete,  
We’re not lacking because you’re lacking.

**[Refrain]**  
Don’t mention them, they’re lurking around,  
The asphalt spirits that disturb you.  
You’re just heads, not thinking at all,  
If I let out a sigh from beside you,  
I’ll open my mouth and come out with a roar.  
And there’s no donkey among you worth my time.  
Oh girls of envy, you’ve all gathered jealousy,  
Not equal to the spirit that you summon.

**[Verse 2]**  
And I take it simply,  
If you annoy me, I’ll explode.  
The one who finished the pack,  
The one who ignites the world,  
The one who explodes with energy.  
Look, you fools,  
You sell to be cheaper,  
And I sell to be better.  
Raising the bar, gathering the guests,  
I’m not messing around.  
Bap bap, and I’m bapping on you,  
And I’ll bring the wolf from the house.  
Can’t find an hour in an hour for anything,  
I come with the gang, you come with the tail.  
Pen of the sea, all with love, Alexandria.  
Kings of the basket, kings of the night, kings of the song.  
Let’s get to work,  
I’m writing a birth for my colleague on the bomb.  
Quietly, we’ll enter,  
Five
