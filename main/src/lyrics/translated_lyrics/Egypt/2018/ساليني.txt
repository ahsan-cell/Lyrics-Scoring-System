**Translated Lyrics:**

**Yeah**  
I'm the best one in this game  
I feel like c’mon, like you get it  
Violence doesn't solve problems  
Like trust me on this one  
To believe me  
Tara-tarara  

**[Verse 1]**  
Like you, I hang it on the hook of circumstances  
Your role model and my life is full of sins  
Long black hair, you're searching  
You made me live in déjà vu  
Sorry, I never excelled in education  
But as a man, I never betrayed a friend  
Tomorrow I'll be a star, making lots of money  
By the end of this year, I’ll get myself some Gucci shoes  
For the third time you tell me, "Meet me," but you never come  
I'm a forgiving person, my heart's wide open  
Without you, I'm nothing, I need you  
I’m everything you used to hear  
Heart wounds don’t heal with a clinic  
Every step I take brings benefits  
Everyone brings you the second chance when you need it  
I told her I don’t love you, and you’re just a habit  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m not thinking about it, ask me  
Life, I’m living it and you keep asking me  
I let things slide a lot, ask me  
Ask me, ask me  
On Instagram, I’m the real one  
You stress me out every time you ask me  
I tell her to leave me alone and ask me  
Ask me, ask me  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’re a big deception, your beauty is fake  
You leave the special for the absent  
You lie when you say, "I’m crazy about you," while you’re alive  
You lie when you say, "I’m crazy about you," oh  
To the sidewalk, I pour my worries out  
Our date was beautiful  
We enjoyed the winter, Alexandria in the fall  
This relationship was a gunshot  
Why am I the only one who gets hurt?  
Wounds are treated at the pharmacy  
And I treat my wounds with friends  
My buddy, tomorrow we’ll play a game, what’s the talk?  
Sorry, my friend, I only see the good times  
My face is special, you drink to forget me  
You find my shape formed in the smoke  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m not thinking about it, ask me  
Life, I’m living it and you keep asking me  
I let things slide a lot, ask me  
Ask me, ask me  
On Instagram, I’m the real one  
You stress me out every time you ask me  
I tell her to leave me alone and ask me  
Ask me, ask me
