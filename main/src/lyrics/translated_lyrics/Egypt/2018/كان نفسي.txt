**Translated Lyrics:**

(What you want is on the production)

[Chorus]  
You want me to talk, but I can’t, hiding in my depths,  
Carrying within corridors that show you nightmares.  
I wished I could wait, but there’s not much time,  
I wished my hour wouldn’t pass, wouldn’t pass.  
You wished I wouldn’t leave you,  
I wished you wouldn’t cry,  
You wished I wouldn’t leave you,  
I wished you wouldn’t cry.

[Verse 1]  
So many eyes and so much talk,  
There’s no one but me behind the scenes.  
I come straight and clear,  
They think my words are riddles,  
My words are riddles.  
I don’t like it when you sulk and frown,  
If you’re rambling, get a grip and wake up.  
I’ll step on your nerves, you’ll rub them and see,  
You’re pleasing your mind, sifting through pills.

[Chorus]  
And I’m hiding in my depths,  
You want me to talk, but I can’t,  
Carrying within corridors that show you nightmares.  
I’m hiding inside, I have depths,  
I have depths,  
I have depths inside me.

[Verse 2]  
Why are your eyes like snipers, not caring for the wounded?  
Words stood between us, but the bleeding doesn’t stop.  
I wait for a reaction, my hair turns gray and there’s nothing,  
We’re thrown into the net, your eyes are hunters.  
And you ask me, “Why are you awake?” as if I’m hit.  
You think about what to ask, while I think of home,  
I ask myself, “How much do I have in my pocket?” because it’s about that.  
My friend, my head is floating, floating, this is for lunch and that’s for dinner.  
I didn’t lose you unless I lost you to a bullet.  
You like everything about it, and she likes your persistence.  
You had interest, but I have no energy.  
I’m not free to be kind and gentle, I’m blocking the surveillance.  
We’re racing against time,  
Who else pays the price but me?  
Hunting eyes throw the net, oh,  
Her hands are guilty to the sky.  
I had a heart, and it was ruined,  
I want the flaw, not the harm.  
My head is clear, my mind is working, and the energy is there.  
The paths are blocked, and the mouths are open,  
The doors are closed, and opportunities are limited.  
The faces are deceitful, and the faces are exposed.

[Chorus]  
You want me to talk, but I can’t, hiding in my depths,  
Carrying within corridors that show you nightmares.  
I wished I could wait, but there’s not much time,  
I wished my hour wouldn’t pass, wouldn’t pass.  
You wished I wouldn’t leave you,  
I wished you wouldn’t cry,  
You wished I wouldn’t leave you,  
I wished you wouldn’t cry.
