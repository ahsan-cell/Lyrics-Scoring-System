**Translated Lyrics:**

Come on, Toti  
Yeah, hey, yeah  
Look at this move  
It's broken, broken  
Completely broken  
Broken, broken  
Broken  

**[Verse 1]**  
My colleague, the job is a mess and it's broken (broken, broken)  
Beach war  
It's fine, no worries, if they gather, I’ll act like a cop (pew pew)  
A gelatinous sound (yeah, yeah) Abdul Basit  
With the charm of Kazem, you won’t say, I’ve made you silent, yeah (completely charming)  
(Ah, don’t let us down) Don’t let us down, both of us, yeah  
(I’m making beef steak) You’re just scraps, I’m making beef steak  
(Fire) We brought the dirty gas, tell me where’s the charcoal? Yeah  
(Fire) We brought the dirty gas, tell me where’s the charcoal? Yeah  

**[Bridge]**  
It’s hard to pass me like the Mina wall (Mina wall)  
A mind that’s not restricted, they forget in the grass (they forget in the grass)  
If your friends hear Samson, they’ll come to you (ah)  
So you act tough while I’m the hero here  
I ruin the party, I turn it off  
Hey bro, keep your girl close and calm her down  
Easily I get her and take her away  
(You’re not my type) And I got the feeling you’re not my type  

**[Verse 2]**  
Life is like the movie "The Watcher" and you’re Aatif (give me that flower)  
(Consequences) Keep in mind you’ll deal with consequences  
(His dad told me not to play with him) The kids don’t play with giants  
(Cash, cash) The money is with Kazem’s crew and you’re broken  

**[Chorus]**  
Completely broken (completely)  
(broken) Broken, broken  
(completely, bruh bruh) Completely broken  
(broken completely) Broken, broken  
(completely) Completely broken  
(I don’t understand anymore, completely)  
(broken) Broken, broken  
(yeah, yeah, yeah) Completely broken  

**[Verse 3]**  
I’ll tell you, yeah  
Bro, there’s not a single girl who loves you  
Bro, your name is Cellulite  
(Passing by people, I’m Abu Haif) (Die alone)  
We’re nightmares, when you see us, you’ll say oh dear (oh dear) yeah  
And then seek refuge, seek refuge, yeah (understand?)  
See where you want to go and give him a packet (packet)  
Just drive it in automatic mode (yeah)  
You’re missing out, you’re chromatic (sco)  
What’s wrong? Take off the jacket, yeah (bruh)  
Don’t come near us (at all)  
I’ll snatch her in Sinai (a beauty)  
It’s just me and her and the desert, hey bro, just us  

**[Chorus]**  
Completely broken  
Broken, broken  
Completely broken  
Broken, broken  
Completely broken  
Broken, broken  
Completely broken  
Don’t tell the watcher, understand?  
(Oh)  
Broken, broken  
Completely broken  
Broken, broken  
Completely broken  
The party is broken  
Completely broken  
Broken, broken  
Broken, broken  

**[Outro]**  
So you don’t complain later from the inside, understand?  
The whole world—everyone’s eyes are on that girl, I swear  
I’ll play cards, we’ll play cards  
Why?  
Attention!
