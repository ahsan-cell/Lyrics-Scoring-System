**Translated Lyrics:**

In my mind, a city of memories in its streets  
I have friends who trade in the forbidden  
No time if I walk wearing five watches  
The game ended long ago, but I'm still gathering words  
Not many will help you along the way  
Anything for free, my friend, we take a lot from it  
Dreams are free, and I dreamed of being a prince  
We became kings, executing on the big shots  
They played me with egg and stone, I played Abracadabra  
I'm Sinatra, creating my legacy  
Me and the circumstances live on the edge  
The world is raising its weapon; I'm a seasoned warrior  
You come and go; we’re friends of the place  
Alexandria brings nothing but emperors  
The forbidden in bags, the lawful drop by drop  
May God protect me from allegiance and support

**[Chorus]**  
Twenty-one, and my tongue is sixty  
And my tongue is a knife, and my humanity, if you can  
We grow old and gray, we grow old and struggle  
And when it comes to wipe away, I hold on and let go  
I own and sell, we bend the iron  
Life is spring  
Oh brother, there’s hashish, oh brother, there are problems  
But who do we complain to, oh brother, there are homes  
Youth on the boats, and the guard is watching  
Rome isn’t far; friends are drowning, and I’m in the deep  
Yeah, our strength is in the safe

**[Verse Two]**  
My weight is 165, my head is just a hundred  
God sends a lot because intentions matter  
They still judge me by appearance, I’m still writing a song  
Putting in it the hopes and worries within me  
When, oh France, when will I go to Paris?  
When will I sell a lot, when will I sell dearly?  
When will you be mine? I can’t live alone  
My friends are men, my friends are tough  
My friends are a nation, and from here to tomorrow, I talk and don’t finish  
Oh, we’re building civilizations  
Inside us, elegance like the rulers of the Emirates  
The same opportunity comes to us while we’re in bars  
(While we’re in bars, while we’re in bars, while we’re in bars)  
On Twitter, I say what’s useful  
And the wise man’s joke, and the new joke  
We greet and bid farewell  
Focus on education  
A lot would have passed me by  
Victory would have passed me by  
The palace would have passed me by  
The cup would have passed me by

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t trust that you’ll leave me in this state  
And return to me in the same state  
Right now, I’m changing the world  
Don’t trust that you’ll leave me in this state  
And return to me in the same state  
Right now, I’m changing the world  
Changing the world

**[Chorus]**  
Twenty-one, and my tongue is sixty  
And my tongue is a knife, and my humanity, if you can  
We grow old and gray, we grow old and struggle  
And when it comes to wipe away, I hold on and let go  
I own and sell, we bend the iron  
Life is spring  
Oh brother, there’s hashish, oh brother, there are problems  
But who do we complain to, oh brother, there are homes  
Youth on the boats, and the guard is watching  
Rome isn’t far; friends are drowning, and I’m in the deep  
Yeah, our strength is in the safe
