**Translated Lyrics:**

We came and went, and God willing  
We drank and dressed, and God willing  
Five of us, and God willing  
(My DJ Toti was on production)

**[Chorus]**  
We came and went, and God willing  
We drank and dressed, and God willing  
Five of us, and God willing  
My hands are heavy, I’m a big deal

**[Verse 1]**  
We all drank, and they sold cheap, oh what a shame  
In a bear's shot and a drop, no warning came  
Don’t put it down or take it up, the rivals are idols  
We won’t forget or leave it, we can’t solve it but as ruins  
My friends and my enemies, both are many  
Mom, don’t be afraid, we’re the bad ones  
The crowd is calm, and my mind is in chaos  
My tongue plays games and fires shots  
The culprits made us their honor  
We walked and got lost  
In the street, we started  
We walked and took off  
I have energy, twenty-four times your strength  
It’s well-known, don’t ask where your ID is

**[Chorus]**  
We came and went, and God willing  
We drank and dressed, and God willing  
Five of us, and God willing  
My hands are heavy, I’m a big deal

**[Verse 2]**  
Don’t eat or drink with the warriors  
A mess and a disaster, he took it and brought a tape  
Don’t enlist me, don’t talk to me  
Unless your hands are beside you  
In the blindness of jealousy, there are no enemies of success  
We sleep in hardship and we sleep in wings  
Just bought a belt and I’m sleeping with a weapon  
You’ll get used to it and we’ll go relaxed  
You’re in the rise and the swallow  
Like glue and wax  
I stomp in the beat and the gathering  
I stab and pull it with blood  
Going is going, and coming is coming  
Bitter in time and sweet in tea  
We flip through pain and stir in the fire  
Pushing in the card and pulling in the one  
Strange creation wearing masks  
Their eyes won’t leave us  
If you come to wash it, it will fade  
And tell you it’s not regretful  
We bring it honestly, sweating for a pound  
Two from Rakishi or they won’t shake me  
And I’ll apply for the third or it won’t break me  
And our lands are seven or they won’t bend me

**[Verse 3]**  
We struggle and suffer, we grew up in the bitterness of time  
We’re completing the deal, I won’t wait until the end of the month  
You pour into the sitting and get tense under pressure  
You get distracted in the hair and snatched in the reply  
We don’t like the fraud, we don’t play in the money  
We’re five of us, and you’re not a problem  
Your brother the star, anyway, management will sign you a reward  
We sew the rivals, and when you sew with the lips  
Egypt hit me, and I’ll drop a schedule  
They multiply by making an officer, and cut AKA Shawkat  
Focusing on the planet and going back  
We’re biting in the round and not chewing on the quality  
If it were up to me, you’d eat bread, stand in two lines with your hands in front  
The world is mine now, raising my cup to the elders  
Wearing my crown with the magician’s stick, evil intends to wipe out the scum  
I’ll lock them up and bring labor, they’ll mumble, we’ll bring you instead  
Knowing the tight alley, knowing the game  
Day and night in these streets, we roam  
I blew on the rock and raised our kids in luxury  
And I’m working my brain and my eyes, and I’ve got a cut ear

**[Chorus]**  
We came and went, and God willing  
We drank and dressed, and God willing  
Five of us, and God willing  
My hands are heavy, I’m a big deal

**[Bridge]**  
We came and went, and God willing  
God willing, God willing  
We came and went, and God willing  
God willing, God willing  
We came and went, and God willing  
God willing, God willing  
We came and went, and God willing  
God willing, God willing

**[Outro]**  
We came and went, and God willing  
We drank and dressed, and God willing  
Five of us, and God willing  
My hands are heavy, I’m a big deal  
Yeah
