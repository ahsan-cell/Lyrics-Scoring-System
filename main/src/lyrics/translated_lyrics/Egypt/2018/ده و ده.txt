**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**
So what should we get? This one or that one or this one?
This one and that one, both?
Both?
Let’s take this one and that one.
But this one doesn’t even fit me.
We’ll take this one and get another one.
But you’re right, I might gain weight later, true.
We could get other colors.
I might lose weight, so bring the smaller size.
(This one, this one, this one, and this one, and this one)
No, bring those three, we’ll get this one, that one, and this one.
We want this one, that one, this one, this one, this one.
(I want this one and I want that one)

**[Chorus: Wegz]**
The star wants this one, that one, this one, that one, this one.
I’m confused whether to choose this one or that one, this one, that one, this one.
So I’ll take this one, that one, this one, that one, this one, that one.
Let’s take everything and leave you this one.
The work won’t fit, fit, fit, fit, fit.
Names aren’t for sale, sale, sale, sale.
And my face is trending in the crowd, crowd, crowd, crowd.
If I say I’m a failure, they say “whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.”

**[Verse 1: Abyusif]**
A long road, and I walked on it.
Divided it fairly, half for me and half for you.
This is my share alone, I cut and slice it.
Big boss, lots of cash.
Keep your eyes on the ground, don’t look at me (don’t look at me).
You paid with your heart’s blood for the jacket (your heart’s blood).
I’m getting it for free just to take a picture (for free).
They told you to return it in the end (return, return).
You look like you’ve taken it (taken).
Annoyed, annoyed, annoying.
Everyone will rise if they want to annoy.
A tyrant with a poster name.
I run to the monkey and tell him to grab his banana.
It didn’t come to my heart (my heart).
Even though you were loud (you were loud).
The Fendi came out (came out).
The world is burning in my city (burning, burning).
I hit Apache (hit).
You hit but it didn’t come (hit).
I don’t settle, Versace, Versace.

**[Chorus: Wegz]**
The star wants this one, that one, this one, that one, this one.
I’m confused whether to choose this one or that one, this one, that one, this one.
So I’ll take this one, that one, this one, that one, this one, that one.
Let’s take everything and leave you this one.
The work won’t fit, fit, fit, fit, fit.
Names aren’t for sale, sale, sale, sale.
And my face is trending in the crowd, crowd, crowd, crowd.
If I say I’m a failure, they say “whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.”

**[Verse 2: Wegz]**
Envious, their hearts are black, black.
Sold out, they don’t like the word.
We sold out.
They changed, bubbling like Coca-Cola.
Life is a poker table, Bula Bula.
Wake up, I tell them in the iron.
Kill them, let’s make new ghosts.
You’re all zero inside and outside, Bika, Bika.
Naturally, we don’t divide the cake, the cake.
We stopped selling, so we’re buying, ri ri ri ri.
I stopped giving, I’m bringing, bringing, bringing, bringing.
Fill the world with what’s in it, it, it, it, it.
And anything I have in it, it, it, it, it.
Still, still want this one, that one, this one, that one, this one.
I don’t know how to choose, so I’ll take this one, that one, this one, that one, this one.
I get really angry, kill this one, that one, this one, that one, this one.
Do it with a flow, like pow pow pow pow pow.
The work won’t fit, won’t fit.
Names aren’t for sale, not for sale.
And my face is trending in the crowd, in the crowd.
If I say I’m a failure, they say “whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.”

**[Verse 3: Abyusif]**
Every time I take a step
