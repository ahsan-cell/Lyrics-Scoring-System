**Translation of the Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**
What’s this, what’s this?

**[Verse 1]**
My friends are my crew, they never fall short,  
My friends are the hype and the thrill of the match,  
My friends are a vacation that can’t be replaced,  
With me, the machine never stops.  
(What’s this, what’s this?)  
There are many people out there,  
You’re not just a family,  
This isn’t a joke,  
There are many of you carrying the weight.  
They’ve put it on you, that’s the difference,  
We’re here crafting glory,  
We’re breaking down barriers,  
The idea is just in the timing,  
No one’s around, love brings it all,  
Thinking of going to talk to Sally,  
Emptying their guts with the machine,  
And I’ll be the perfect student.  
Beast mode automatic,  
Beast mode, you’re done for,  
I’m expanding your horizons,  
I didn’t fall short, everyone knows that,  
Everyone wants fame, wants the beat,  
Pablo and Molotov on the beat,  
What do you want to eat? I’m the chef,  
Today’s dish is dynamite.  
Bitch, Rockstar on the beat,  
My friend, Rockstar on the beat,  
My friend, this flow is worth millions, swings and roundabouts, we’ve flipped the scales, yeah.  
My friend, I’m cool, I’m peace, and I’ve got the bag, call the fools, yeah.  
I’m wild on the beat, I’m a dog, I’m chic, and she’s in your bed,  
We’ve shattered the statues, and there’s no one like us broadcasting, yeah.

**[Verse 2]**
The vision is hazy,  
Everyone’s gonna mess up, no accounting,  
I’m spinning, go tell the youth,  
Let them know if I step into the ring with them, I’ll take the belt,  
I’ll knock them down with words,  
I’ll fight them with peace,  
Yet I’m a crime, crime, crime, crime, crime, crime, crime, yeah.  
None of them are a crime, crime, yeah.  
Let them know I’m a crime, yeah.  
I'ma get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, yeah.  
They’re all fake,  
I'ma get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, yeah.  
I'ma get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, haha.  
My friend, give me the weapon ‘cause I’m hunting with the dogs,  
And I’ll run after them, chase them,  
Everywhere I’ll pursue them,  
Everywhere bruises,  
The war leaves marks,  
They want me to act like everyone else,  
But I’m doing my own thing,  
I’m not into the left paths,  
Bad like the good, like the  
Mad like voodoo and the  
Sun was originally a flash,  
Like the hood and the hash,  
I’m drinking like the cup,  
I'ma get 'em, get 'em, get 'em,  
None of them are a crime, crime, yeah.  
Let them know I’m a crime, yeah.  
I'ma get 'em, get 'em, get 'em, yeah.  
I'ma get 'em, get 'em, get 'em (Let’s go).
