**Translated Lyrics:**

Me and my family, we’re gonna share  
Bullets, bullets, bullets in the air  
They say we’re always winning, it’s not fair  
But we don’t care, yeah  

In the classroom with a Cuban cigar  
A bag and a half, just me and my crew  
I’m not nice, I’m not Nubian  
Not a broadcaster, I don’t hide my flaws  
Wegz and Twon, we’ll make you music so the world can hear America  
Don’t come our way, we’ll take you down, my friend, we’re fighting like Belgium’s team  
You’ll find me with 20k left  
Dad’s from Egypt, and you’re my kids  
I’ll go out tonight, come back with a story  
I’m tired of saying how much it costs  
All the time  
You know I don’t care, me and my family, we’re gonna share  
We seize the moment, we don’t wait  
Working hard, we don’t wish  
Out of my life if you’re not feeling it  
I, I, I, I’m the one  
Grinding at night with the crew  
It doesn’t change that I’m working in green  
Not alone, but it’s more dangerous  
Make a mistake, your face will get cut  
We’ll do it and capture the moment  
Music, I’m writing history  
Putting codeine in the cup  
A box melting from Putin  
A box in my direction won’t come  
Taste the box if it’s real  
All my friends are solid  
Here, my head’s on the pillow  
My friend, the blood here is juice  
Here’s the rice and the weed  
I do it in the world, they hear it in Paris  

**Twon:**
How you feeling with the Glock now?  
Holding thousands in a drop now (so much cash)  
So I come in buggin’ right at ya (Kill it, ‘cause)  
I go kill it on a Kanye  
Yeah, yeah  
Me and Wegz on the trend now  
We put tracks on the trend  
Breaking flows on the back now  
Now we’re gonna prepare ya  
I don’t care where you at, ya  
Each time, where you at, ya?  
Car broke, where you at, ya?  
Now exactly where you at, ya?  
Bringing it back now, what you say  
DJ Fat Sam on the way  
Pulling out like an AK  
Break, tap, make the legs break  
What you want, nigga? What you need?  
Gangsta, nigga, our RPG  
What you want, nigga? What you need?  
A thousand keys  
(I am on a highway  
I just looking like  
‘Cause, nigga, I don’t care, ya  
Yeah, bitch, I don’t care, ya  
Tell them bitches I don’t care, ya)
