**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
The word is sharp, you live in sin and call it paradise  
We talk about manhood, they talk about material, moving without precedence  
- I walk by the principle of a good son, oh children of the  
Since when, oh students, what’s this talk?  
You speak of heroism, where’s its belt?

**[Verse 1]**  
You have a text that wipes out ants, tomorrow I’ll lift the support  
Tomorrow they’ll crawl over each other, and then I’ll see the joy  
We’ll go to the festival, my dignity won’t reach you  
We rose from below, we’ve elevated, we feast on honey  
They’ll be satisfied with the division when they taste need  
A left-handed man in the village, every outsider around you  
Children fear the round, smelling your urine  
We don’t like the entrance, you don’t like the exit  
As if someone among them is filling my belly with the month’s stuffing  
The strongest in the region, undoubtedly the strongest in Egypt  
My colleague, this isn’t living, it starts with humiliation and ends in a grave  
Don’t hit me in the belly, my belly and back are my back  
I’m fresh-faced, without sweating, I'm so fresh  
I’ll raise you two groups, bye and bench  
Your brother is the front, I just attend but don’t speak  
Life is tough, I don’t suffer from its whips  
Work is divided, masters of the market, selling is forbidden  
I say audible words, executed whenever I say allowed  
I won’t make you poor, I’ll let everyone die of hunger  
I’m not forgetting you and not mingling with you, the work is clear  
The king is exposed, the pawn gets eaten  
My movements in the port, I import from the coast  
I act like I don’t understand but I know and witness  
At the right time, we’ll gather the tickets  

**[Chorus]**  
The word is sharp, you live in sin and call it paradise  
We talk about manhood, they talk about material, moving without precedence  
- I walk by the principle of a good son, oh children of the  
Since when, oh students, what’s this talk?  
You speak of heroism, where’s its belt?

**[Verse 2]**  
I wouldn’t be surprised if I fill my hands  
Everyone bows at my feet  
They bring gas and mention my name  
They bring a bike  
They bring Chinese, we bring Nike  
We bring Nike  
We bring Fendi  
We bring Fendi  
They stray from the path of the lawful  
Illegal traders  
Illegal traders with the ages of children  
And they tell you it’s better than asking  
Rushing for sustenance, oh uncle  
And they tell you it’s better than asking  
Illegal traders with the ages of children  
Illegal traders  
Illegal traders  
Illegal traders  
Illegal traders, illegal traders  
Illegal traders, illegal traders  
Illegal traders, illegal traders  
Illegal traders, illegal traders  
Illegal traders, illegal traders
