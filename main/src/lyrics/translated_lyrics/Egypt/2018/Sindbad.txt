**Translated Lyrics:**

Yeah, a new year  
And you’re still in my mind, fixed like the Mona Lisa, yeah  
Yeah-yeah  

**[Chorus]**  
Wake up from your sleep  
I haven’t slept since yesterday  
All night I’ve been lost in the sky  
Sounds cliché, I know  
But it’s real  
This year smells like money  
It smells like wine, it smells like lessons  
It came safe and not locked up  
Thank God  
As long as I sleep, I’m full  
Someone else has gone mad  
I’m content with my fate and not upset  
I’m blessed  
There’s no time to waste  
Here, there are no fakes  
And any fakes, I’ll sell  
And it’s all up to God  

**[Verse 1]**  
It’s all up to God  
Tomorrow and the day after, it’s not in my hands  
My friend, leave it to God  
Oh man, glory be to God  
No provision comes by force  
No love is by coercion  
Baby, I’m a star  
There’s no sleep  
There’s a bank account  
I want to fill it with zeros  
My mind’s in the game  
Please don’t kill my vibe  
I don’t want you on sight  
Bitch, I’m in the zone, yeah  
Forget what’s past  
Just keep spinning around  
Go to my friend Sinbad  
Yeah-yeah-yeah  
I don’t see you in my future, I won’t hide  
Hate as much as you want, I won’t burn you in my blood  
I feel like I’m the best one who ever did it  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  

**[Chorus]**  
I haven’t slept since yesterday  
All night I’ve been lost in the sky  
Sounds cliché, I know  
But it’s real  
This year smells like money  
It smells like wine, it smells like lessons  
It came safe and not locked up  
Thank God  
As long as I sleep, I’m full  
Someone else has gone mad  
I’m content with my fate and not upset  
I’m blessed  
There’s no time to waste  
Here, there are no fakes  
And any fakes, I’ll sell  
And it’s all up to God  

**[Verse 2]**  
Yeah, it’s all up to God  
Yeah, let’s go  
The work has expanded for us  
You wish to be one of us  
Walking in the street among us  
Don’t get your hopes up  
You’ll hang like decoration  
I’m the one  
Yeah, she knows I’m the one, yeah  
I made a wave and they want to ride it  
My friend, wake up, my friend, rise  
Focus on who’s driving  
Name a street after me once I’m gone  
This isn’t a dream, it’s ambition, yeah  
I have positive energy  
I have many friends, and they’re tough  
I’m not from Egypt, I’m from Alexandria  
This year, I’m taking it for myself  

**[Chorus]**  
Wake up from your sleep  
I haven’t slept since yesterday  
All night I’ve been lost in the sky  
Sounds cliché, I know  
But it’s real  
This year smells like money  
It smells like wine, it smells like lessons  
It came safe and not locked up  
Thank God  
As long as I sleep, I’m full  
Someone else has gone mad  
I’m content with my fate and not upset  
I’m blessed  
There’s no time to waste  
Here, there are no fakes  
And any fakes, I’ll sell  
And it’s all up to God
