**Translated Lyrics:**

(Ah, ah, ah)  
Molotof on the beat

**[Chorus]**  
My friend, bring money, bring money, bring money  
I went to a sheikh, he told me I'm possessed  
Here I'm trapped, I'm here trapped  
The sheikh says bring money, bring money  
My devil tells me bring money, bring money  
People say bring money, bring money  
I'm here trapped, I'm here trapped  
My friend, go bring money, bring money, bring money  
My street is known and filled with dogs  
I've never read a book in my life  
I opened the page, closed the door  
I'm here guarded, guarded, guarded  
I'm here trapped, I'm here thrown away  
In an empty space, they set conditions for me  
Here it's known, known, known (What?)

**[Verse]**  
Here it's known, known, known  
No one cares about the circumstances  
No one cares what's in the hearts  
Everything's in my heart and it will melt away  
Lost in my thoughts until evening  
I'm not free if you're upset  
Coming and going, there's no belonging  
I don't feel guilty, there's no accusation  
Yeah  
We've come to the time of games  
Nerves will be left behind  
Take it easy on the kid  
It's a trip all this  
I didn't teach the kid to swim  
Many thoughts at bedtime  
Every now and then they ask  
When will his hand touch it?  
We're placed on the map (on the map)  
They made calculations for us here  
Filling the gap  
If you have beef, cover it and forget it  
Opened both my eyes  
Thinking originally in the Hussein  
Let's create a party in the square  
Coming for me, buckle up  
A friend with two faces here is a liar  
You rest on the side and take how much?

**[Chorus]**  
My friend, bring money, bring money, bring money  
My friend, bring money, bring money, bring money  
My friend, bring money, my friend, bring money  
My friend, bring money, money, money, money  
Money, money, money, money, money  
Bring money, bring money  
My devil tells me bring money, bring money  
People say bring money, bring money  
Bring money, bring money, bring money, bring money  
I'm here trapped, I'm here trapped  
My friend, go bring money, bring money, bring money  
My friend, go bring money, bring money, bring money  
My friend, go bring money, bring money, bring money

**[Outro]**  
My friend, go press, press, press, press, press, press  
Press, press, press, press, press, press, press, press  
My friend, I'm here trapped, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss  
Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss  
My friend, bring money, bring money, bring money  
My friend, bring money, bring money, bring money  
My friend, bring money, my friend, bring money  
My friend, bring money, money, money, money, money, money, money
