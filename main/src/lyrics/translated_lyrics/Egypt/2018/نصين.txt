**Translated Lyrics:**

Let it go, let it go for me, let it go for me  
My heart and mind are in conflict  
Yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey  

**[Chorus]**  
My heart and mind are in conflict  
And I'm split in two  
If you're not coming, I'll bring you  
Where are you taking me?  
In my cage, trapped in loss  
And I'm the one they’re watching  
Everyone's dancing down below  
And they didn’t ask what’s going on outside  

**[Verse 1]**  
We drift apart, we drift apart  
The state of things  
I disappear, I disappear  
When I wake up, I see  
Paris, Paris  
My eyes are thirsty and want to see  
On the mud of depression, we plant some weed and live cheerfully  
Ahead of my age, ahead of time  
Ah, like honey, like honey, like honey  
Ten green tears, their eyes like honey  
Thank God my name is well-known  
Among the people, any corpse I give him  
Time will show, I’m at the pharmacy  
What did you graduate in? Graduated all this!  
Who’s your friend? Who’s your uncle?  
Ah, you come with him, go back with him, and your blood is in him  
At the crime scene, my face on the tape  
No, it’s not my leg, my friend is on the scene  
Clapping with a crew, my words are sharp, and the eloquent nut  
(On the scene)  
They mention me a lot  
(On the scene)  
I turn in the shrine  
My head is poison, my hand is movement  
My colleague Zuri eats bread and opens a company  
My head is a crown, in my pocket a stack  
Enjoy, my life is short  
My voice, my voice, no, I’m not Turkish  
I’m not Turkish  

**[Chorus]**  
My heart and mind are in conflict  
And I'm split in two  
If you're not coming, I'll bring you  
Where are you taking me?  
In my cage, trapped in loss  
And I'm the one they’re watching  
Everyone's dancing down below  
And they didn’t ask what’s going on outside
