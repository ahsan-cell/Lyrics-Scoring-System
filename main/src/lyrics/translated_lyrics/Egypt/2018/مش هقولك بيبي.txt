**Translated Lyrics:**

I brought balloons, I brought your games  
Your heart is a trap, my heart is lost in shame  
I run away from you as if I've caused a crime  

**[Verse 1: Wegz]**  
I brought balloons, I brought your games (your games)  
Your heart is a trap, my heart is lost in shame (lost in shame)  
I run away from you as if I've caused a crime (a crime)  
Music, I’ll do what you love  
And we’ll drive into the world of dreams  
In a Mercedes, escaping from sorrows  
And because I understand, if two faces show  
What’s up, about the worries and the tears  
I have dreams bigger than me, we’ve crossed the line  
I’ll make more out of it than you, just watch me shine  
You say it doesn’t matter, and I say I don’t feel it  
And you don’t need me, a traitor, I can sense it  
So please, let me off this time  
Please don’t leave me for the beggars  
You kill me inside and tell me to move on  
You’ll say stop, pay my bills  

**[Chorus]**  
And I won’t call you baby (I won’t call you baby)  
I won’t call you baby (I won’t call you baby)  
I won’t call you baby (I won’t call you baby)  
I won’t call you baby, won’t call you baby  
Baby, oh  

**[Verse 2: Afrotto]**  
You say you’re not interested, so why are you looking at me?  
My mood is unstable, it’s better for you to stay away  
Maybe in a moment I’ll love you, but in another moment I might hate you  
But what I know is I won’t call you baby  
I won’t call you baby, won’t call you baby  
I won’t call you baby, no, I won’t call you baby  
Tell me why you’re lying, I don’t love anyone but you  
So I won’t call you baby, no, I won’t call you baby  
So consider me a prank and consider yourself foolish  
The story was a failure from the start  
Oh, I caught you off guard, you were foolish  
You’re beautiful, no flattery, but terrible with these words  
What’s this talk? You understand, you get it, oh  
Fax, it’s fine, oh, I don’t love you, forget me  
I’m the star, every time I annoy you, you love me  
I hung up on you, hello, this number says let me go  
So I blocked, blocked, blocked, blocked like Radwa El Sherbiny, oh  
You’ll see me sad, wishing for me to be strong  
Sorry, I thought out loud  
I was saying the sentence in my mind  
Try to forgive me for what’s past  
And take away the mistakes  
My love for you was fake like a salon marriage  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, I won’t call you baby  
I won’t call you baby  
I won’t call you baby, no  
I won’t call you baby  
No, no, I won’t call you baby  
I won’t call you baby  
I won’t call you baby
