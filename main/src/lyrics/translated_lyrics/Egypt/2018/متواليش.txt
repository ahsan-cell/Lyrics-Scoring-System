**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse]**  
Madmen living in a world ruled by fools,  
We'll sedate them and dance them like the flames of the stoves.  
Puzzles that only the weary can solve,  
We’ll catch you with our hunters, so don’t you see me?  
Troublemakers, my father, we don’t play with your tricks.  
In the alleys, black shadows, my back is strong, I won’t yield.  
I won’t give in, I won’t give in, I won’t give in.  
Light of lights, let me see it,  
Let’s not judge it before I know its circumstances.  
I won’t give in, let it live,  
If I see its fear, education matters to me.  
No, no, no, no, no, it’s not death.  
A foreigner, and I don’t play allegiance, I won’t give in.  
The workers and the managers,  
My stories are waiting,  
Those who oppose me will go mad,  
If they sell it, they’ll be imprisoned,  
Those who trusted the traitors are named.  
A puppet show, and they’re entertained,  
If it falls into their hands, they won’t name it.  
My single friends, they won’t come out,  
I have a bunch of envious ones who won’t be named.  
A puppet show, and they’re entertained,  
If it falls into their hands, they won’t name it.  
My single friends, they won’t come out,  
I have a bunch of envious ones who won’t be named.  
Your betrayal won’t catch up with the traitors,  
The blow comes from behind, you end up dead.  
Who can stand against them, the mighty?  
And they don’t fear the divisions and informants.  
Fighters (yeah),  
Don’t give in (yeah),  
Fighters (yeah),  
Don’t give in.

**[Outro]**  
Good morning to the stoners,  
Thrown in bars and shops,  
We gather them to tell them tales.
