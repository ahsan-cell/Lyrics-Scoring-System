**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
My friends are tough, broke but bold,  
I’ve never felt my life slipping away.  
A therapist healing my wounds,  
I’m wounded, I’m wounded.  
You’re not alone, my heart is lost,  
Your mind is poisoned, craving something new.  
You’ve built a barrier, don’t cross it,  
I’m no angel, but you’re a devil.  
Enough of the jokes, you’re greedy for me alone,  
I can’t let go of the rest because I love to be chained.  
I’m not the one who’s chained, I’m not the one who’s edited,  
Baby, stop being the superstar in your film.  
Crying on the pillow, I’m making the material,  
I told her to ruin you, so the thousand counts as charity.  
We keep talking, joking, and breaking down,  
We love, we get hurt, we get hit, and decide to say goodbye (say goodbye).  
You should have left before the war began (began),  
It doesn’t hurt that I’m selling out, she was buying.  
Selling and paying the price,  
What’s left in me isn’t much.  
I live searching for a reason,  
And die without finding an explanation.  
I live obeying time,  
Tomorrow will be better, and God is great.  
We were raised on hardship,  
And grew up asking about the check.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m poison, don’t you dare love me,  
I’ll wander and pray for you to miss me.  
A mermaid drowning, forgive me,  
Try to pull me back to shore.  
I’m poison, don’t you dare love me,  
I’ll wander and pray for you to miss me.  
A mermaid drowning, forgive me,  
Try to pull me back to shore.  
Drowning, forgive me,  
Try to pull me back to shore.  
Drowning, forgive me,  
Try to pull me back to shore.

**[Verse 2]**  
I know ten girls, all beautiful,  
Not one can handle them walking away gradually.  
I’ll talk to ten more,  
Searching for my share, I’m in suffering.  
I’m wounded, I’m wounded,  
Injuries, pains, I’m wounded.  
We’re in suffering, I’m wounded,  
I’m wounded, I’m wounded.  
There’s no exit, I close it off,  
Send me today and I’ll wait for tomorrow.  
I hope tomorrow brings me hope,  
Young and sad, but a star on the poster.  
Fuck fame, fuck love,  
Fuck fake friends.  
Bitches love us, we love Benz,  
Get me paid to buy that stuff.  
She got me shoes and booze,  
And I only got her that dick alone.  
Got her that dick (only),  
Got her that dick (only),  
Got her that dick.

**[Chorus]**  
I’m poison, don’t you dare love me,  
I’ll wander and pray for you to miss me.  
A mermaid drowning, forgive me,  
Try to pull me back to shore.
