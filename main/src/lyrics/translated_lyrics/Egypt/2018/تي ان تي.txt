**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
You think you can shut me down? You know Wegz from the tone,  
French rap with style,  
The beat hits hard like I'm playing wing,  
Superstar, rap blinging,  
TNT, I blow up the stage,  
With a shot of ping,  
I'm glitching, A.K.A. Glitch.

**[Verse]**  
We unleash the energy while you shake your shoulders,  
Rappers, we’re rubber, at the top of the game, you’re just a burden,  
Patta and Nike, there’s a difference in quality,  
Careless, I’m so Egyptian, it’s a vibe,  
We’ve fought hard in our field, the peak is where we belong,  
Holding Egypt high,  
We taught the masters, our words are steel to you,  
Flow like lava from the earth's core,  
We’re the new generation, we’ve drained the energy,  
So we finish the pack, repeat, we’re still listening,  
Because we don’t lack you, delete, they envy us,  
With your knowledge, I won and didn’t lose a dime.  
I’m a big boss shaking up this great hall,  
I go heavy on that beat like I’m Rick Ross,  
L5VAV, the house moves your shoulders,  
Seeing the flow, Wegz's syndrome,  
And this world is submissive, walking in herds,  
Just like being whipped, a system like the system,  
Rap in Arabic, can’t find you, Lord of the lost, respond to the lost,  
A war of attrition and cannibalism, if your flesh isn’t forbidden,  
You’re surprised why I’m at the top,  
Sorry, it’s not me at the top, where’s the peak then?  
King roaster, the sky’s your level beneath your feet,  
Compared to Ferrero Rocher, your sweets aren’t fair,  
This scene is candy, your minds are paranoid,  
Our wars are bloody, a doctrine of ISIS,  
Our judgments are fascist, your mind is airy,  
Our strikes are decisive, our shots are instant,  
With my voice, I create street art,  
You’re doing, but not hearing,  
With my voice, I create street art,  
You’re doing, but not hearing,  
I told you before, our paths aren’t clear,  
Your tracks are a disaster,  
(Damn, Damn) You’re over, I don’t feel you, we came to fix the tilt,  
When I forgive, I don’t forget,  
It’s normal to feel the pain, human,  
I sing for the sorrow to dance for me and fade away,  
Proof that I’m not a failure is that I have enemies,  
My mom warned me about the caravan and dogs,  
My words are dark, rap in a crypt,  
As if I’m translating Kafka’s words,  
We sing for war on the day of peace,  
You won’t be more Muslim than me with a belt,  
Like cargo delivery,  
I provide everything like Carrefour,  
"You have something to die for," she told me, Wegz,  
And my heart and mind are in conflict, baby, like Darfur,  
Middle East, I am the music, I am the,  
Double E, I’m Hollywood, I am,  
I’m the street, I’ve seen a lot,  
While you were blind, you didn’t see me,  
I’m the ceiling of ambitions you wish to surpass,  
I’m money, art, lights, and what you desire,  
Everything you desire, everything you desire,  
Everything you desire, everything you desire.
