**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: CL, Bom, Minzy, Dara]  
Hey, playboy, it's about time and your time’s up  
I had to do this one for my girls, you know  
Sometimes, you gotta act like you don't care  
That's the only way you boys learn  
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh (2NE1; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh (2NE1; Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Verse 1: Minzy, CL, Dara]  
The lipstick on your collar (Mwah)  
I can never forgive that (Uh-uh)  
Every day, dozens of times, my phone's off  
It feels like nothing will change, oh, oh  
So many girlfriends who are just friends  
Don't think of me the same way, I won’t let it slide  
Do as you please now, I’ll throw away my regrets  
I really loved you once, oh-oh, oh  

[Pre-Chorus: CL]  
Sometimes drunk, you call me  
It's five-thirty in the morning  
You call out another girl's name  
No, no  

[Chorus: Bom]  
I don't care, I'm done  
Wherever you are, whatever you do  
I really won't care anymore, can you step aside?  
Don’t come crying and begging now  

[Post-Chorus: Bom, Minzy]  
'Cause I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
'Cause I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
Boy, I don’t care  

[Verse 2: Minzy, Dara]  
You’re so pathetic, stealing glances at other girls  
The couple ring you always leave off, blind dates behind my back  
I feel like I can't take it anymore, oh-oh, oh  
Countless friends who say you’re not the one  
I lost all my friends because of you, but  
I feel freer now, I was too good for you  
I believed it was love, oh-oh, oh  

[Pre-Chorus: CL]  
You say you're busy again today  
I tried calling, but  
Of course, I hear a girl laughing in the background  
Oh, no  

[Chorus: Bom]  
I don’t care, I’m done  
Wherever you are, whatever you do  
I really won’t care anymore, can you step aside?  
Don’t come crying and begging now  

[Post-Chorus: Bom, CL]  
'Cause I don’t ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
'Cause I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don’t ca-a-a-a-a-are  
Boy, I don't care  

[Verse 3: Minzy]  
I remember the nights I cried because of you, boy  
Thinking of the days I’ll regret makes me feel relieved, boy  
Isn’t it a waste to let me go, yet too trivial to keep?  
You should have treated me well while you had the chance, why are you begging now?  

[Verse 4: CL]  
I’ve been fooled by your lies hundreds of times  
From today on, I’m a bad girl who makes men cry  
Now I laugh at you without a single tear  
In this game of love, you’re the loser  
Kneel down and repent your mistakes  
Or just get out of my sight right now  
Now clap your hands to this  

[Chorus: Bom]  
I don't care (Oh), I'm done (Oh-oh)  
Wherever you are, whatever you do  
I really won’t care anymore, can you step aside? (Mmm)  
Don’t come crying and begging now  

[Post-Chorus: Bom, Minzy]  
'Cause I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
'Cause I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
Boy, I don't care  

[Chorus]  
I don't care, I'm done (Oh, oh)  
Wherever you are, whatever you do  
I really won’t care anymore, can you step aside? (Mmm)  
Don’t come crying and begging now  
You know I don't care, oh no  

[Post-Chorus: Bom, Minzy]  
Ca-a-a-a-a-are  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
'Cause I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are (You know, I just don't care)  
I don't ca-a-a-a-a-are  
Boy, I don't care
