**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Jessica, Yuri]  
Get it together, you’re such a bad boy  
It’s just curiosity, not love  
All this time, I’ve been fooled  
I fell for you, thinking it was real  

[Refrain: Yoona]  
You’re boring, you have no manners  
You’re a devil, devil, you, you  

[Verse 2: Taeyeon, Tiffany]  
Your phone’s full of other guys  
Just one letter (just one letter) changed in the girl  
The perfume that makes me sick to my stomach  
Whose is it? Explain it to me  

[Pre-Chorus: Sooyoung, Hyoyeon]  
Are you seeing someone behind my back?  
Haven’t you fixed that terrible habit?  
Even if you run, you’re still in my palm  

[Chorus: All, Sunny, Seohyun, Taeyeon]  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
I can’t see you anymore, can you kick me out?  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
Even if you hold on, I’ll lose interest, hey  
On the day I become even more amazing  
I’ll pay you back, don’t forget  
You better run, run, run, run, run  

[Post-Chorus: Hyoyeon]  
Gotcha, you’re teasing me  
Run, devil, devil, run, run  

[Verse 3: Seohyun, Tiffany]  
You glance at me softly  
Always checking out other girls  
When I’m not around, you’re a super playboy  
Lift your head up, answer me  

[Refrain: Yuri]  
You’re boring, you have no manners  
You’re a devil, devil, you, you  

[Chorus: All, Yoona, Sunny, Jessica]  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
I can’t see you anymore, can you kick me out?  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
Even if you hold on, I’ll lose interest, hey  
On the day I become even more amazing  
I’ll pay you back, don’t forget  
You better run, run, run, run, run  

[Post-Chorus: Tiffany, Taeyeon]  
Gotcha, you’re teasing me  
Run, devil, devil, run, run  
You’re boring, you have no manners  
Run, devil, devil, run, run  

[Bridge: Sunny, Hyoyeon, Taeyeon, Sooyoung]  
There’s no one like me anywhere  
I’m disappointed by your tricks  
I’m greater than those others  
What will you become, growing up like that?  
I told you not to mess around  
You should have treated me right when you loved me  

[Chorus: All, Yuri, Sooyoung, Seohyun, (Taeyeon)]  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
I can’t see you anymore, can you kick me out?  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
Even if you hold on, I’ll lose interest, hey  
On the day I become even more amazing  
I’ll pay you back, don’t forget  
You better run, run, run, run, run (You better run, run, run)  

[Post-Chorus: Jessica, Taeyeon]  
In this vast world, half are men  
Even if you’re gone, it doesn’t matter  
I’ll wait for a wonderful man  
I’ll wait alone.
