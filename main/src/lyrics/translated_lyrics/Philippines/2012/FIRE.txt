**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: CL]  
I go by the name CL of 2NE1  
It's been a long time coming, but we're here now  
And we're about to set the roof on fire, baby (Uh-oh)  
You better get yours, 'cause I’m getting mine  
Ay  

[Refrain: Bom, Dara, All]  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh  
2NE1  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh  
You better ring the alarm  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh  
We're 2NE1  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  

[Verse 1: CL, Minzy]  
Come in, come in, come in to another world  
Leave behind the boring worries that weigh you down  
La-la-la-la with my unpretentious tune  
Ha-ha-ha-ha so I won’t laugh at you again  
Now let’s dance, dance, dance, want to get down  
Dream bigger, bigger, bigger, the world is mine  
Because I can do anything for great freedom tonight  
Tonight, oh  

[Pre-Chorus: Bom]  
My gaze shines like twinkling stars  
The light that burns inside my heart  
It may not last forever, but I have nothing to lose  
Oh, oh, yeah  

[Chorus: CL]  
I want to go mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-crazy  
I want to run faster, faster, faster, faster, faster  
Over those tall buildings, up into the blue sky  
I want to shout out loud, loud, loud, loud, loud  

[Post-Chorus: Dara]  
You got the fire, pounding in my chest  
You got to drop it like it's hot  
Don’t try to stop now (Ooh)  
The fire, booming in my head  
I got to drop it like it's hot  
Don’t try to stop now (Hey)  

[Verse 2: CL, Minzy]  
Get up, get up, get up, even if I fall many times  
Even if the world I trusted betrays me again  
I-I-I won’t cry like a fool  
Oh no-no-no, don’t act coy like others  
I’ll take you all the way, follow, follow me  
My heart races as I run until I’m breathless  
Somehow, I don’t mind, it’s fun, don’t be afraid, let it go  
To a better tomorrow, le-le-le-le-le-let's go  

[Pre-Chorus: Bom]  
My gaze shines like twinkling stars  
The light that burns inside my heart  
It may not last forever, but I have nothing to lose  
Oh, oh, yeah, oh  

[Chorus: CL]  
I want to go mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-crazy  
I want to run faster, faster, faster, faster, faster  
Over those tall buildings, up into the blue sky  
I want to shout out loud, loud, loud, loud, loud  

[Interlude: CL]  
Switch it up  

[Refrain: Bom, Dara]  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh  
2NE1  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh  
You better ring the alarm  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh, eh  
We're 2NE1  
Eh-eh-eh, eh-eh-eh  

[Bridge: Dara, CL]  
Let your hair sway-sway-sway-sway  
Shake your hips sway-sway-sway-sway  
Let your hair sway-sway-sway-sway  
Shake your hips sway-sway-sway-sway, uh  

[Chorus: CL]  
I want to go mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-mi-crazy (Oh)  
I want to run faster, faster, faster, faster, faster  
Over those tall buildings (over those buildings) up into the blue sky (up into the sky)  
I want to shout out loud, loud, loud, loud, loud  

[Outro: CL]  
I always want to be as free as today.
