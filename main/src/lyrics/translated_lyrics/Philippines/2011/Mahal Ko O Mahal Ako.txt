**Translated Lyrics:**

There are two of you in my life, and now  
I need to choose, only one can stay  
You know I'm here, always for you  
Oh, I love you so much, but you want someone else  
And sheâ€™s here, offering me a pure love (Love)  
I'm confused, so very confused  

**[Chorus]**  
Who should I love?  
Is it you, my dream, or her who knocks on my heart?  
Oh, what should I follow? My mind or my heart?  
I'm confused, so very confused  
Who should I choose? The one I love or the one who loves me?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Even if I'm not the one you love, if I stay with you  
Maybe you'll learn to love me too  
And if she is truly faithful, perhaps as time goes by  
I might also learn to love her  

**[Chorus]**  
Who should I love?  
Is it you, my dream, or her who knocks on my heart?  
Oh, what should I follow? My mind or my heart?  
I'm confused, so very confused  
Who should I choose?  

**[Bridge]**  
What I want is to experience love  
And to be reciprocated with love  

**[Chorus]**  
Who should I love?  
Is it you, my dream, or her? (Or her?)  
Oh, what should I follow? My mind or my heart? (My mind or my heart?)  
I'm confused, so very confused, so very confused  
Who should I choose?  
The one I love or the one who loves me?
