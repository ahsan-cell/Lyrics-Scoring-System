**Translated Lyrics:**

With every hour that passes, it’s you  
That I keep thinking of  
I can’t stop the beating of my heart  
You are the dream I’ve always had  
Since I realized  
That one day my heart would love

[Chorus]  
You are the love I’ve been waiting for  
My heart has been sad for so long, but now you are here  
You are the love given to me by the Creator  
You are a blessing in my life, my joy and my love is you

[Verse 2]  
Time stops with every moment we share  
The world spins slower  
My heart smiles on its own  
Because the question has been answered  
I used to worry  
If someone would truly love me

[Chorus]  
You are the love I’ve been waiting for  
My heart has been sad for so long, but now you are here  
You are the love given to me by the Creator  
You are a blessing in my life, my joy and my love is you

[Bridge]  
And I’ve never loved like this before  
Thinking of being with you for a lifetime

[Chorus]  
You are the love I’ve been waiting for  
My heart has been sad for so long, but now you are here  
You are the love given to me by the Creator  
You are a blessing in my life, my joy and my love is you  
(You are the love I’ve been waiting for)  
My heart has been sad for so long, but now you are here  
You are the love given to me by the Creator  
You are a blessing in my life, my joy and my love is you

[Outro]  
My love is you
