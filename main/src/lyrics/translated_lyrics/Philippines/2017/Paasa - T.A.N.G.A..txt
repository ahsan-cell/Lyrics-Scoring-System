**Translated Lyrics:**

Ah-ah, ah-ah  
Hehe  

[Verse 1]  
I thought there was a meaning  
To your liking my status on Facebook  
You also reply on Twitter  
I thought that was it  
But I saw yesterday, you posted something else  
With a beautiful girl by your side  
You told me she’s just a friend  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s hard to be T-A-N-G-A (fool)  
It’s hard to be T-A-N-G-A  

[Chorus]  
You’re just leading me on because you know I have a crush on you (Oh)  
Yes, I have a crush on you (Oh)  
Unbelievable, oh, even back then  
You were asking questions  
About who’s in my Facebook status  
Hey, that was about you  
Wishing I could be your girlfriend, oh-oh-oh  

[Verse 2]  
I feel like I want to say  
The feelings I’ve been hiding from you, oh  
I’m like a cop trying to stalk  
Your profile, what’s up?  
But when I saw yesterday, your post with someone else  
My world changed  
I feel like, boy, she’s your girl, ah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s hard to be T-A-N-G-A  
It’s hard to be T-A-N-G-A  

[Chorus]  
You’re just leading me on because you know I have a crush on you (Oh)  
Yes, I have a crush on you (Oh)  
Unbelievable, oh, even back then  
You were asking questions  
About who’s in my Facebook status  
Hey, that was about you  
Wishing I could be your girlfriend  

[Bridge]  
Now I’m thinking, did I lose my chance? (Leading on)  
I suspect you might like me (Leading on)  
It’s looking broken (Leading on)  
Thinking that (Leading on), your message means something  
(What does your message mean to me?)  
(I’m so confused, so confused)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s hard to be T-A-N-G-A (Oh)  
It’s hard to be T-A-N-G-A  

[Chorus]  
You’re just leading me on because you know I have a crush on you (Oh)  
Yes, I have a crush on you (Oh)  
Unbelievable, oh, even back then  
You were asking questions  
About who’s in my Facebook status, oh  
That was about you  
Wishing I could be your girlfriend.
