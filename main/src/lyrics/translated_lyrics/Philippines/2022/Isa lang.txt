**Translated Lyrics:**

Mmm, whoa-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, mmm  

[Verse 1]  
Let’s first talk about your night  
You are my rest, my love  
My smile brightens when I’m talking to you, just be patient if  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We’ll still return to each other  
Even if you don’t seek me out  
I’ll just be enslaved to you  
You quench the thirst of my heart  
Oh, eager for the depth of your gaze upon me  
When you notice me  
I’ll make it clear to you that  

[Chorus]  
There’s only one, just one  
That I’m searching for, my desire  
It’s only you, only you  
If fate allows  
Will you be mine?  

[Verse 2]  
Wherever I go, I don’t know why in my heart  
Your name is the only thing that fills it  
I don’t understand why you still follow your stars  
And not what you feel for me, but  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We’ll still return to each other  
Even if you don’t seek me out  
I’ll just be enslaved to you  
You quench the thirst of my heart  
Oh, eager for the depth of your gaze upon me  
When you notice me  
I’ll make it clear to you that  

[Chorus]  
There’s only one, just one  
That I’m searching for, my desire  
It’s only you, only you  
If fate allows  
Will you be mine?  

[Bridge]  
If you’re teasing, tease me again  
Can it just be with me, just me?  
If you’re teasing, tease me again  
Can it just be with me, just me?  
If you’re teasing, tease me again  
Can it just be with me, just me?  

[Chorus]  
There’s only one, just one  
That I’m searching for, my desire  
It’s only you, only you  
If fate allows  
Will you be mine?
