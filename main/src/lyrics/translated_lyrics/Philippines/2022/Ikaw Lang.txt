**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, how beautiful it is to behold your eyes  
Sparkling brightly, I can't understand  
Your glances, so full of brilliance  
The heavens have come down, the stars are falling

[Chorus]  
Look into my eyes  
And you don’t need to ask  
Over and over again, you are the one I love  
And if you’re not convinced, just trust  
Hold my heart and believe that  
You are the one I’ve loved  
You are the one I will love

[Verse 2]  
And in your sweet caress, I too have fallen  
I don’t know what to do  
I don’t know where to look  
A kiss on the lips, let’s gaze at each other  
I never thought you would fall for me

[Chorus]  
Look into my eyes  
And you don’t need to ask  
Over and over again, you are the one I love  
And if you’re not convinced, just trust  
Hold my heart and believe that  
You are the one I’ve loved  
You are the one I will love  
My dear

[Bridge]  
And as the sun sets, I thought you didn’t love me  
And what I felt wouldn’t last  
Who knew I wouldn’t tire  
I will love you no matter how long it takes

[Chorus]  
Look into my eyes  
And you don’t need to ask  
Over and over again, you are the one I love  
And if you’re not convinced, just trust  
Hold my heart and believe that  
You are the one I’ve loved  
You are the one I will love

[Post-Chorus]  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Outro]  
My dear
