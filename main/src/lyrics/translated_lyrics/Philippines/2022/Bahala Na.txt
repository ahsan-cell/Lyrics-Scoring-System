**Translated Lyrics:**

(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]  
I can't explain what I'm feeling  
Is it really her?  
But there are so many rivals

[Pre-Chorus]  
It doesn't matter  
Who am I for her to choose, right?  
I don't want to force myself  
On someone who doesn't know me

[Chorus]  
Am I going to take a chance?  
I'm betting my heart again  
It might be wasted or I might be embarrassed  
Oh, whatever will be, will be

[Verse 2]  
A dream  
To be together until we grow old  
Even though I don't really know her that well (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]  
It doesn't matter  
Who am I for her to choose, right?  
I don't want to force myself  
On someone who doesn't know me

[Chorus]  
Am I going to take a chance?  
I'm betting my heart again  
It might be wasted or I might be embarrassed  
Oh, whatever will be, will be (Oh, yeah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]  
It doesn't matter  
Who am I for her to choose, right?  
(Oh, hey!)  
It doesn't matter  
Who am I for her to choose, right?

[Bridge]  
It doesn't matter  
Who am I for her to choose, right?  
It's hard to  
Trust and believe in just anyone

[Chorus]  
Am I going to take a chance?  
I'm betting my heart again (Yeah)  
It might be wasted or I might be embarrassed  
Oh, whatever will be, will be (Woah)
