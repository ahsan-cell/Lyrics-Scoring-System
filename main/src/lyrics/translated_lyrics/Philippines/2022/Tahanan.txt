**Translated Lyrics:**

Every day, it’s only you that  
I always long for  
The light I see in you  
Serves as my guiding star  
My smile is brighter when you’re near  
I feel your love, my dear  
You stand out, unique and rare  
You’re the one meant for me  
To you alone, to you alone I’ll return  

[Chorus]  
So here you are beside me  
Oh, just stay here, just stay here  
The world slows down  
When you are around  
Oh, my home  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, home  
Just stay here, just stay here, just stay here  
Oh, my home  
La-ta-ta-da-ta-da, mm  

[Verse 2]  
In every moment we share  
Wrapped in each other’s embrace  
Your warmth envelops me  
Chasing away my cold feelings  
We were brought together  
By the right moment  
It’s undeniable that for me  
You are the only certainty, ahh  
Only you, you are the one I cherish  
(You are the one I cherish)  

[Bridge]  
It’s just you and me that can be seen (Can be seen)  
In the paradise we’ve begun  
Oh, my home  

[Refrain]  
You erase all your smiles  
The negativity clinging to my lips  
Your smile captures my delight  
A truth I cannot deny  
That I love you, no one else  

[Chorus]  
So here you are beside me  
Oh, just stay here, just stay here  
The world slows down  
When you are around  
Oh, my home  

[Outro]  
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, home  
Just stay here, just stay here, just stay here  
Here with me  
(You erase all your smiles)  
The negativity clinging to my lips  
The world slows down  
(Your smile captures my delight)  
A truth I cannot deny  
Ta-ta-ta-ta-ta, home  
Just stay here, just stay here, just stay here  
Oh, my home, mm
