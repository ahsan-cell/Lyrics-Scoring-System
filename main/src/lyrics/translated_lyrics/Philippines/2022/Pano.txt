**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, my love, can you hear yourself?
It drives me crazy, the words that come from your lips
I know I'm foolish, I know I'm fragile
But I'm just human too

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something too
I'm not numb like you
I know someone like you is used to letting go
Am I going to walk away?

[Chorus]
What about me?
I've fallen for you
Did you really just let me go?
What about me?
I waited so long for you
Was all of that nothing to you?
What am I supposed to do? (Hmm-hmm)
(Na-na-na-na-na-na, na)

[Verse 2]
Are you doing this on purpose
Or do you just enjoy hurting me?
After I offered my shoulder when you cried
What do you think of me?
Am I a slave?
Don't you have any decency?
What have you done?
I trusted you

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something too
I'm not numb like you
I know someone like you is used to letting go
Am I going to walk away?

[Chorus]
What about me?
I've fallen for you
Did you really just let me go?
What about me?
I waited so long for you
Was all of that nothing to you?
What am I supposed to do? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
What about me?
I've fallen for you
Did you really just let me go?
What about me?
I waited so long for you
Was all of that nothing to you?
What am I supposed to do?
