**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 1]  
If I let go gently,  
Will I be freed from our  
Yesterdays that tenderness can no longer mend?  
Are promises enough to bring us  
Together again in the future?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Why remind me?  
It won’t be held onto anyway.  
Why insist?  
If we’re not (if we’re not) meant to be...

[Chorus]  
For each other? Oh  
Wasn't it, my love, just the two of us back then  
For each other? Oh, whoa  
Why didn’t time agree with us?

[Verse 2]  
Maybe there’s nothing left  
From the letters you wrote for me.  
I know tears erase,  
But just let it be.

[Verse 3]  
My prayers are pointless  
If I’m not the one you seek.  
Even if I scream my pleas to you,  
Why don’t you feel this?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Why remind me?  
It won’t be held onto anyway.  
Why insist?  
If we’re not (if we’re not) meant to be...

[Chorus]  
For each other? Oh  
Wasn't it, my love, just the two of us back then  
For each other? Oh, whoa  
Why didn’t time agree with us?

[Chorus]  
For each other (For each other)  
Wasn't it, my love, just the two of us back then (We, we)  
For each other? Oh, whoa  
Why didn’t time agree with us?
