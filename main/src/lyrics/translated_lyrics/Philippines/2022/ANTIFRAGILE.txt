**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain: All]  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Antifragile, antifragile  

[Verse 1: Chaewon, Yunjin, Kazuha]  
Riding on a thorny path  
You made me rise up (Ah-ah-ah-ah)  
A party filled with lies  
I’m not even bothered  
There are many words behind me  
Even I’m hearing about my rival for the first time  
Everyone prays for my downfall  
But over that hand, I'ma jump in (Yes, gimme that)  

[Pre-Chorus: Eunchae, Chaewon, Kazuha, Sakura]  
Walk with pride like a lion  
In my eyes, a massive desire (Na-na-na, eh)  
Pour more, gasoline on fire  
Flying again through the flames, rising (Na-na-na, eh)  
Don’t forget the toe shoes I left behind  
What more do you need to say?  
Don’t ignore my career that I’ve walked  
I’ll ride until I die, die  

[Chorus: Chaewon, Yunjin]  
I’ll go higher  
To the world I dreamed of, at the very top (Ah-ah)  
I can fall and it’s okay  
I'm antifragile, antifragile (Ah-ah)  
I’m on my way now  
Throw away your fairytale (Ah-ah)  
Now, you know my name  
I'm antifragile, antifragile  

[Refrain: All]  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Antifragile, antifragile  

[Verse 2: Kazuha, Chaewon, Yunjin]  
Lovey, lovey, lovey, dovey, dovey, dovey  
You decide how to see me  
I don't know what to say  
I can't feel it  
Warm attention is welcome  
Cute jealousy, go ahead  
No thanks to the puppet on a string  
This song will write my future (Yeah, gimme that)  

[Pre-Chorus: Sakura, Eunchae, Kazuha, Chaewon]  
Walk with pride like a lion  
In my eyes, a massive desire (Na-na-na, eh)  
Pour more, gasoline on fire  
Flying again through the flames, rising (Na-na-na, eh)  
Don’t forget the toe shoes I left behind  
What more do you need to say?  
Don’t ignore my career that I’ve walked  
I’ll ride until I die, die  

[Chorus: Sakura, Eunchae]  
I’ll go higher  
To the world I dreamed of, at the very top (Ah-ah)  
I can fall and it’s okay  
I'm antifragile, antifragile (Ah-ah)  
I’m on my way now  
Throw away your fairytale (Ah-ah)  
Now, you know my name  
I’m antifragile, antifragile  

[Refrain: All]  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Antifragile, antifragile  

[Bridge: Kazuha, Eunchae, Yunjin, Sakura, *Chaewon*]  
We can break it, baby  
Rock it, twist it, lock it, baby  
All I know is you can’t chain me  
'Cause I’m gonna break out, gonna, gonna break out, out  
We can break it, baby  
Rock it, twist it, lock it, baby (Rock it, twist it, lock it, baby)  
All I know is you can't chain me (All I know is you can't chain me)  
'Cause I’m gonna break out, gonna, gonna break out, out (*Woah-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh*)  

[Chorus: Kazuha, Yunjin]  
I’ll go higher  
To the world I dreamed of, at the very top (Ah-ah)  
I can fall and it’s okay  
I'm antifragile, antifragile (Ah-ah)  
I’m on my way now  
Throw away your fairytale (Ah-ah)  
Now, you know my name  
I'm antifragile, antifragile  

[Refrain: All]  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile  
Anti-ti-ti-ti-fragile, fragile  
Antifragile, antifragile
