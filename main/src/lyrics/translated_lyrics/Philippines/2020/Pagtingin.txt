**Translated Lyrics:**

I have more to say  
But let’s hold off for now  
Let’s just wait for the wind  
To carry the words away  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don’t blame me  
It’s hard to take a chance  
I’ll dive into the sea  
Even if there’s nothing to gain  

**[Chorus]**  
When feelings are laid bare  
I hope your view won’t change  
Admit the secrets we share  
I hope your view won’t change  

**[Verse 3]**  
Why is it always like this?  
We need to understand each other  
I’m feeling so confused  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Don’t blame me  
It’s hard to take a chance  
I’ll dive into the sea  
Even if there’s nothing to gain  

**[Chorus]**  
When feelings are laid bare  
I hope your view won’t change  
Admit the secrets we share  
I hope your view won’t change  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Hints  
I hope your view won’t change  
Hints  
I hope your view won’t change  

**[Bridge]**  
I’ll only love when I’m ready  
Not just when it’s a whim, just for fun  
I’ll only love when I’m ready  
Not just when it’s a whim, just for fun  

**[Chorus]**  
When feelings are laid bare  
I hope your view won’t change  
Admit the secrets we share  
I hope your view won’t change  
Try to pray  
I hope your view won’t change  
Maybe tomorrow you’ll be mine  
I hope your view won’t change  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Hints  
I hope your view won’t change  
Hints  
I hope your view won’t change
