**Translated Lyrics:**

Why is it so hard  
To speak honestly?  
Misunderstandings  
Could have been discussed  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Wait, can I know  
What’s on your mind?  
So there are no wrong assumptions  

[Chorus]  
It feels like you left so quickly  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  
Where did we go wrong? Can we make amends?  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  
It’s still too early  

[Verse 2]  
What is it that you’re searching for?  
Is the answer with me?  
How will we know  
If we keep blaming each other?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Wait, can I know  
What’s on your mind?  
So there are no wrong assumptions  

[Chorus]  
It feels like you left so quickly  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  
Where did we go wrong? Can we make amends?  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  

[Bridge]  
It’s still too early for you to be gone  
I believed too much in your promises  
That I loved you more than myself  
Oh my God, why can’t I forget you?  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  
Where did we go wrong? Can we make amends?  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  

[Chorus]  
Just a moment, why the rush?  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  
Where did we go wrong? Can we make amends?  
Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment  

[Outro]  
It’s still too early for you to be gone  
It’s still too early (Hold on, hold on, hold on for a moment)  
For you to be gone
