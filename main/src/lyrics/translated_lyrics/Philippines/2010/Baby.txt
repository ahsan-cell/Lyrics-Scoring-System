**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Justin Bieber]  
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh, woah-oh-oh-oh, oh  
Oh, woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh  

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber & Ludacris]  
You know you love me, I know you care (Yeah, uh)  
Just call me whenever and I'll be there (Yeah, uh)  
You're my love, you're my heart (Yeah, uh)  
And we'll never, ever, ever be apart (Yeah, uh)  
Are we a couple? Baby, stop playing (Yeah, uh)  
Are we just friends? What are you saying? (Yeah, uh)  
She said, "There's someone else," and looked me in the eyes (Yeah, uh)  
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I said (Yeah, uh)  

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
Baby, baby, baby, oh  
I said baby, baby, baby, no  
I said baby, baby, baby, oh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  
Baby, baby, baby, oh  
I said baby, baby, baby, no  
I said baby, baby, baby, oh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber & Ludacris]  
Oh, for you, I would have done anything (Yeah, uh)  
And I just can't believe we're not together (Yeah, uh)  
And I want to act cool, but I'm losing you (Yeah, uh)  
I'll buy you anything, I'll get you any ring (Yeah, uh)  
And I'm shattered, baby, fix me (Yeah, uh)  
And just shake me until I wake from this nightmare (Yeah, uh)  
I'm sinking, sinking, sinking (Yeah, uh)  
And I just can't believe my first love isn't around, and I say  

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
Baby, baby, baby, oh  
I said baby, baby, baby, no  
I said baby, baby, baby, oh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  
Baby, baby, baby, oh  
I said baby, baby, baby, no  
I said baby, baby, baby, oh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  

[Verse 3: Ludacris]  
(Luda) When I was thirteen, I had my first love  
There was nobody that compared to my baby, and no one could come between us  
She had me going crazy, oh, I was fascinated  
Waking up daily, didn't need a Starbucks (Wuh)  
She made my heart race, and it skipped a beat when I saw her on the street and  
At school, on the playground, but I really wanted to see her on the weekend  
She knows she got me dazed because she was so amazing  
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep saying  

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
Baby, baby, baby, oh  
I said baby, baby, baby, no  
I said baby, baby, baby, oh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  
Baby, baby, baby, oh  
I said baby, baby, baby, no  
I said baby, baby, baby, oh  
I thought you'd always be mine, mine  

[Outro: Justin Bieber]  
I'm done  
Now I'm done (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Now I'm done (Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Now I'm done (Done, done, done, done), I'm done
