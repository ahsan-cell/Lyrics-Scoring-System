**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: All]  
Look at me  
Dantaran-dan, dantaran-dan, dantaran-dan, dadadadap  
Dantaran-dan, dantaran-dan, dantaran-dan, dadadadap  

[Verse 1: Siwon, Heechul, Leeteuk & Eunhyuk]  
Do you know or not, do you know or not, oh beautiful lady?  
Even if they say I'm crazy, I still like you, oh beauty  
Someone tell my baby, to my baby  
That I'm right here waiting, waiting for you  
(Baby, you turn it up now!)  

[Refrain: Kyuhyun, Yesung]  
You, just say something, just say something, oh beauty  
If you have my heart, then I’m a winner in life  
The way of this world, the way of this world  
Follows those with courage, like me  

[Pre-Chorus: Ryeowook, Sungmin, Ryeowook & Sungmin]  
As the old saying goes, if you strike ten times, you’ll succeed, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh  
She’s a tough opponent, no doubt about it, pouting, pouting, pouting  
What should I do? What should I do? She’s the only one I care about, about, about  

[Chorus: All]  
Bounce to you, bounce to you, my heart  
Is racing towards you, it’s beating so fast I can’t catch it  
Break it down to you, down to you, my heart  
Will stop if I can’t have you  
(Look at me)  

[Post-Chorus: All, Leeteuk & Eunhyuk]  
Should I look or not, should I look or not, should I look or not at a guy like me?  
Pretending not to see, pretending not to see, even if I turn around  
No matter how much I look, no matter how much I look, there’s only me  
It’s obvious, it’s obvious, it’s obvious  
(Baby, you turn it up now!)  

[Verse 2: Donghae, Kyuhyun, Yesung]  
What should I buy, buy, buy, buy as a gift for you?  
Oh! I’m going crazy just thinking about how you’ll like it  
Listen girl! (I like you)  
Baby girl! (I love you)  
I’m the only man for you  
(Listen to my confession towards you)  

[Pre-Chorus: Ryeowook, Sungmin, Ryeowook & Sungmin]  
My heart says, please don’t just tease me, nod, nod, nod  
With this effort, I could save myself, how commendable, how commendable, how commendable  
What should I do? What should I do? She’s my everything, everything, everything  

[Chorus: All]  
Bounce to you, bounce to you, my heart  
Is racing towards you, it’s beating so fast I can’t catch it  
Break it down to you, down to you, my heart  
Will stop if I can’t have you  
(Look at me)  

[Post-Chorus: All]  
Should I look or not, should I look or not, should I look or not at a guy like me?  
Pretending not to see, pretending not to see, even if I turn around  
No matter how much I look, no matter how much I look, there’s only me  
It’s obvious, it’s obvious, it’s obvious, there’s only me  

[Pre-Bridge: Leeteuk, Heechul, Eunhyuk, Siwon]  
I’m finally going to go crazy, I’m going to explode  
I can’t hold it in anymore, her push and pull  
Oh, I’m really going to lose it, someone stop me  
Who would have said it would be this hard?  

[Bridge: Ryeowook, Kyuhyun]  
(It’s) true, true, my feelings have nowhere to go  
I’ve adjusted to you, you know that well  
How to keep loving you? I’ll really treat you well  
Don’t let me rot like this  

[Post-Bridge: Yesung, Leeteuk/Shindong/Donghae, All, Ryeowook & Kyuhyun]  
I’m waiting, oh beauty!  
(Hope you’ll step to me, step to me!)  
I love you, oh beauty!  
(Bring it, sign to me, sign to me!)  
Hahaha, hahaha!  
Looks like she was already ready to look at me  

[Chorus: All]  
Bounce to you, bounce to you, my heart
