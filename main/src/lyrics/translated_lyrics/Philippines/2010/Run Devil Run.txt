**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Jessica, Yuri]  
Get it right, you’re such a bad boy  
Just curiosity, not love  
All this time, I was fooled  
I fell for you, thinking it was real  

[Refrain: Yoona]  
You’re boring, you’ve got no manners  
You’re a devil, devil, you, you  

[Verse 2: Taeyeon, Tiffany]  
Your phone’s filled with countless guys  
Just one letter (just one letter) changed in the girl  
That perfume is nauseating,  
Whose is it? Explain it to me  

[Pre-Chorus: Sooyoung, Hyoyeon]  
Are you seeing someone behind my back?  
Haven’t you fixed that terrible habit?  
Even if you run, you’re still in my palm  

[Chorus: All, Sunny, Seohyun, Taeyeon]  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
I can’t see you anymore, can you kick me out?  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
Even if you hold me back, I’ll lose interest, hey  
On the day I become even more amazing  
I’ll pay you back, don’t forget  
You better run, run, run, run, run  

[Post-Chorus: Hyoyeon]  
Gotcha, I’m teasing you  
Run, devil, devil, run, run  

[Verse 3: Seohyun, Tiffany]  
You glance at me softly  
Always checking out other girls  
When I’m not around, you’re a super playboy  
Lift your head up, answer me  

[Refrain: Yuri]  
You’re boring, you’ve got no manners  
You’re a devil, devil, you, you  

[Chorus: All, Yoona, Sunny, Jessica]  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
I can’t see you anymore, can you kick me out?  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
Even if you hold me back, I’ll lose interest, hey  
On the day I become even more amazing  
I’ll pay you back, don’t forget  
You better run, run, run, run, run  

[Post-Chorus: Tiffany, Taeyeon]  
Gotcha, I’m teasing you  
Run, devil, devil, run, run  
You’re boring, you’ve got no manners  
Run, devil, devil, run, run  

[Bridge: Sunny, Hyoyeon, Taeyeon, Sooyoung]  
There’s no one like me anywhere  
I’m disappointed by your tricks  
I’m greater than those others  
What will you become being so big?  
I told you not to mess around  
You should have treated me right when you loved me  

[Chorus: All, Yuri, Sooyoung, Seohyun, (Taeyeon)]  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
I can’t see you anymore, can you kick me out?  
You better run, run, run, run, run  
Even if you hold me back, I’ll lose interest, hey  
On the day I become even more amazing  
I’ll pay you back, don’t forget  
You better run, run, run, run, run (You better run, run, run)  

[Post-Chorus: Jessica, Taeyeon]  
In this vast world, half are men  
Even if you’re gone, it doesn’t matter  
I’ll wait for a wonderful man  
Just for me, I’ll wait alone
