**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Crakky]**  
This is the text he sent me,  
He said, "Next to the blue gate, past the store,  
And the door is brown."

**[Jom]**  
Oh, am I knocking now?

**[Crakky]**  
Oh...

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Crakky]**  
Even if serenading isn't in style anymore (not in style anymore),  
And they say love can now be found online,  
Isn't it ugly when it's too easy?  
You can just get it without even asking for a blessing.  
I'm already outside your house,  
I've passed a few corners, had my fights, but that's okay as long as I have a goal—  
To greet your dad and give your mom a nice hello.

Oh, how about that?  
Well, I'll just toughen up,  
As long as what I did has no bitterness,  
So even if times change,  
I won't replace how I loved you from the very start,  
I will continue to surpass that.

Stay here with me,  
In my heart where no one else should belong,  
Except you, because you're the kind of woman who shouldn't be replaced.

From any angle you look,  
It's truly a delight to behold.  
You're happy by my side,  
And I don't see you getting tired.  
Oh, isn't it true?

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Jom]**  
I always find myself smiling,  
Good thing you never said no to me.  
Since I found you,  
I felt something different right away.

Please, don’t leave,  
Just stay here,  
So I won’t miss you.

Don’t disappear,  
You know you belong with me.  
Nothing else makes me smile,  
It’s not easy,  
I’ve been through that before.  
So every moment  
That you’re beside me,  
I won’t think of any reason to fight.

To make you upset,  
I’ll show you your worth,  
Even if sometimes you’re grumpy,  
I still want you to be with me.

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Clien]**  
I hope you just stay here,  
How long will I be alone?  
It’s hard to get used to being without you.

Here by my side,  
You should be here,  
When I’m with you,  
I feel so happy.

And if only I could,  
I’d want to hug you and be with you,  
But it’s just a dream, it’s tiring,  
I miss seeing you laugh.

Because I can’t help but  
Think of you, there’s no end to it.  
You’re the only one I need,  
I promise I won’t let you down.

I want you to stay here,  
I hope no one interferes.  
I don’t want it to be just words,  
Stay with me because I love you.

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Crakky]**  
No plans to change, no turning back,  
Leaving you, I can't find a reason for that.  
I want you to stay here (stay here),  
You're all that I need.

**[Russell]**  
I can’t just turn my back on you,  
Because I want you to know how much I
