**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We tried so hard to avoid  
These kinds of questions  
And even though we’re unsure  
We continued our connection  

[Verse 2]  
Now our conversations have run dry  
Regret has begun to arise  
Everything seems so unclear  
Not knowing where to go from here  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I knew it all along  
We should have realized from the start  
Not to hope, not to believe  

[Chorus]  
We can’t be together  
Brought together but not meant to be  
It’s no longer possible  
Let’s not torment our hearts  
I’m giving up the fight, we can’t be, woah, woah-oh, oh  

[Verse 3]  
The weight of feelings is so heavy  
Why can’t we just admit it?  
From the very beginning  
We knew we had no chance  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I knew it all along  
We should have realized from the start  
Not to hope, not to believe  

[Chorus]  
We can’t be together  
Brought together but not meant to be  
It’s no longer possible  
Let’s not torment our hearts  
I’m giving up the fight, we can’t be  

[Bridge]  
We can’t be because from the start  
We knew there were limits  
And even if we try, this is where it ends, this is where it ends  

[Chorus]  
We can’t be together  
Brought together but not meant to be  
It’s no longer possible  
Let’s not torment our hearts  
I’m giving up the fight, we can’t be  

[Outro]  
We can’t be
