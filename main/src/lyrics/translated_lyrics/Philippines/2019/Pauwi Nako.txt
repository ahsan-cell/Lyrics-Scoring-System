**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Hey, I miss you, baby, I can't take it anymore  
I'm so happy that we'll be together again  
I promise you won't have to wait anymore and (No more)  
You won't be sad, I'm almost there  

**[Post-Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Baby, I'm on my way home, I'm coming home  
Baby, I'm on my way home, I miss you so much  
Baby, I'm on my way home, hey,  
You won't be sad anymore, I'm almost there  
Baby, I'm on my way home  

**[Verse 1: Jnske]**  
I don't want to see sadness in your eyes  
So I found a way to ease your sorrow  
Rather than seeing you like this all the time, I don’t want you to get hurt  
I can feel how painful it is, that's why I don’t want to make you feel that way  
I'm almost there, just a little more time and we'll be together  
I'm almost there, right by your side, just a little patience, love, your sadness will fade  
I'm so happy to be with you again after such a long time apart  
I promise I won't leave your side, I swear, you won't be alone, I'm coming home  

**[Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
I miss you, baby, I can't take it anymore  
I'm so happy that we'll be together again  
I promise you won't have to wait anymore and (No more)  
You won't be sad, I'm almost there  

**[Post-Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Baby, I'm on my way home, I'm coming home  
Baby, I'm on my way home, I miss you so much  
Baby, I'm on my way home, hey,  
You won't be sad anymore, I'm almost there  
Baby, I'm on my way home  

**[Verse 2: Bullet-D]**  
I'm on my way home, can you please not be mad at me?  
I’ve brought what you need, I miss you, what did I do wrong?  
I want to see you, please don’t be angry with me (Angry), because you might look worse (Worse)  
But even if you keep getting mad, I’ll still come home to you, they can't tempt me (Woo!)  
Why are you always grumpy with me? (With me)  
Can we fix this? (This)  
Our arguments sometimes aren’t tiring to understand  
I love you, you know that, I won’t look for anyone else  
Just remember this, my love is only for you  
But before anything else, I’m going home (Going home)  
Just a moment, don’t scold me (—old me)  
I’ve missed our playful moments when we sometimes had misunderstandings (—understandings)  
It’s hard being away from someone like you, that’s one thing I’ve learned  
So I’ll make up for my shortcomings, I’ll be your pillow again  

**[Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Hey, I miss you, baby, I can't take it anymore  
I'm so happy that we'll be together again  
I promise you won't have to wait anymore and (No more)  
You won't be sad, I'm almost there  

**[Post-Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Baby, I'm on my way home, I'm coming home  
Baby, I'm on my way home, I miss you so much  
Baby, I'm on my way home, hey,  
You won't be sad anymore, I'm almost there  
Baby, I'm on my way home  

**[Verse 3: Yuridope, Bullet-D]**  
I’m on my way (On my way), sorry (Sorry)  
If I made you wait, hold on, sorry, I’m on my way (Woo)  
Are you getting impatient? (Impatient!), hold on, I’m almost there (Bppp)  
Do you want me to pick something up so I can buy it here?  
So nothing will disturb us (—bother!), nothing will interrupt our time (—interrupt!)  
Just the two of us, no one else, traveling until the stars (Stars!)  
The vehicle is just a bed (Bed), and you too  
Because when you’re with me, I know I won’t get lost (Woo!)  
I’m excited to hug you (Hug you!), to claim everything that’s mine (Mine!)  
Not a second will be wasted, the kind where you’ll be looking for me every now and then  
My affection that you can’t compare to anyone else  
You won’t feel cold again, you can count on that when I arrive  

**[Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Hey, I
