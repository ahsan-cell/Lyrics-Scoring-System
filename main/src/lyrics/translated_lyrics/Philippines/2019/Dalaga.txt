**Translated Lyrics:**

Baby, don’t hesitate anymore  
You know that I really need you  
Someone like you, I’ve been searching for so long  
And I want to see you, yeah  
I want to see you  

[Post-Chorus: Crakky]  
A Filipina maiden, yeah  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  

[Verse 1: Clien]  
Woah baby, I want to see  
That Filipina girl  
I met back then on social media  
She’s captivating, so I sent my heart her way  
Like the flow of the sea when I lie down  
Don’t worry, baby, I’ll miss you  
Even if you’re far, you’re by my side  
We said goodbye face to face  
I plan to wait for your return  
It’s been two months since we’ve been apart  
Baby, take care over there  
When you come back to me, we’ll make up for lost hugs and kisses  

[Chorus: Crakky]  
Baby, don’t hesitate anymore  
You know that I really need you  
Someone like you, I’ve been searching for so long  
And I want to see you, yeah  
I want to see you  

[Post-Chorus: Crakky]  
A Filipina maiden, yeah  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  

[Verse 2: Crakky]  
Where do you usually go?  
When I find you, maybe I’ll see you  
If only I could talk to you, even just for a moment  
Please let me get closer  
So I can stick close to you  
Or lighten up your day with my persistence  
Surely now you’re of age  
There’s nothing forbidden between us  
We can leave together  
Without hiding where we are  
Because I’ve been to so many places  
And I haven’t seen anyone like you  
With your beauty, I know I’ll only find joy with you  

[Chorus: Crakky]  
Baby, don’t hesitate anymore  
You know that I really need you  
Someone like you, I’ve been searching for so long  
And I want to see you, yeah  
I want to see you  

[Post-Chorus: Crakky]  
A Filipina maiden, yeah  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  

[Verse 3: Russell]  
I’ve been searching for a long time  
For a maiden who will make me happy  
I won’t let you be away from me  
Once I find you, yah  
I desire nothing but to be beside you  
I’ll savor every moment, ready to stay late  
You’re the reason for my longing  
I hope you’ll grant me a kiss  
When you arrive, it’ll be pure joy  
You’re the answer to all my questions  
Let’s not delay any longer, just the two of us  
You know that being by your side is heaven  
Because it’s just a figment of imagination that fades away  
I hope that tomorrow when I wake up, you’ll be with me, yeah  

[Chorus: Crakky]  
Baby, don’t hesitate anymore  
You know that I really need you  
Someone like you, I’ve been searching for so long  
And I want to see you, yeah  
I want to see you  

[Post-Chorus: Crakky]  
A Filipina maiden, yeah  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  

[Verse 4: Jom]  
I saw a woman  
I can’t forget her image  
What’s your name?  
When I saw you, I couldn’t sit still  
I want to hold your hands  
Even now, I can’t settle down  
I hope I can catch up with you  
So I can learn your name  
And get to know you  

[Chorus: Crakky]  
Baby, don’t hesitate anymore  
You know that I really need you  
Someone like you, I’ve been searching for so long  
And I want to see you, yeah  
I want to see you  

[Post-Chorus: Crakky]  
A Filipina maiden, yeah  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden  
Filipina maiden, yeah  
A Filipina maiden
