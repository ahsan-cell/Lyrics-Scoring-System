**Translated Lyrics:**

Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship  

[Verse 1: Nik Makino]  
Call me "Mister Who's The Chick, Nik?", 'cause I got plenty  
Her T-shirt and pants are black, with pink panties  
I dropped her to the floor, then she felt cold  
She wrapped around me while she was getting thrilled  
She can't help but feel the heat I bring  
Scratching and moaning, she’s feeling everything  
She said, "N-I-K (What?), go deeper"  
"Faster now", "Come on, keep it up"  
Are you charcoal? (Why? Why?)  
Because earlier you were burning for me  
Are you ice cream? (Why? Why?)  
Because you want to be licked  
Are you rice? (Why? Why?)  
Because you want to be threshed (Huh)  
Are you chicharrón? (Why? Why?)  
Because you make noise when I eat you  

[Chorus: Nik Makino]  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship  

[Verse 2: Nik Makino]  
With the beauty of your eyes and smile, I’m attracted (Crack)  
Chest locking up like there’s a heart attack  
You don’t want anyone else, you want N-I-K  
N-I to the motha— (Motha), mothafuckin' K  
'Cause I’m lit, a bit handsome in your eyes  
S-A-M P-I-N-T-O, so sexy, perfectly fit  
That flat petite, a little playful (Yeah)  
Long hair and eyes that are slightly slanted  
That’s my type sometimes when there’s no fake  
Lasting in the game like Jordan in game six (Six)  
She’s super sexy, mini skirt and fake C  
A chick who’s always down, you won’t regret  
Are you studying? (Why? Why?)  
Because you want to be explored (Huh)  
Are you flour? (Why? Why?)  
Because you want to be kneaded  

[Chorus: Nik Makino]  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship (Boom)  

[Verse 3: Raf Davis]  
Spaceship, I’ll take you  
Everything you need, I’ve got it all  
Safe when you’re with me, don’t be surprised  
You won’t doubt, there’s no need to worry  
It’s ten o'clock at night, I can’t sit still  
Not even lit yet, and you’re not beside me  
When you say yes babe, I can’t resist  
I miss every part, don’t act up  
My mind’s dry for you, waiting  
Chicks are dry, all wanna bang  
After one night stand, still they wanna hang  
Tapping on the street, bitch, yeah, I’m the man  
Neneng B, I’m your boy picker  
Can I see you? What time is our meet-up?  
Are you a car? (Why?)  
Because you want me to ride you  

[Chorus: Nik Makino]  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship  
Boom, like Neneng B is her body (Body)  
So nice to look at you (Look at you)  
Are you a rose? (Why? Why?)  
Because I’ll take you on a spaceship
