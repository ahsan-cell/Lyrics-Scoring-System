**Translated Lyrics:**

They say, one day it will come  
The one thing you’ve been wishing for  
And when my prayer was answered  
It could no longer be hidden  

**[Pre-Chorus: Moira Dela Torre]**  
The hope I found in your eyes  
And the fear of losing you someday  

**[Chorus: Moira Dela Torre]**  
And now, here you are  
I can’t explain what I feel  
I’m ready for eternity  
I won’t let you down, I won’t hurt you  
From then until now  
It’s you and me  

**[Verse 2: Jason Marvin]**  
And at last, I have found  
The one thing I’ve been wishing for  
A promise to you that you’ll come first  
And it’s undeniable  

**[Pre-Chorus: Jason Marvin]**  
The destiny I found in your love  
That will make our love last  

**[Chorus: Both, Moira Dela Torre, Jason Marvin]**  
And now, here you are  
I can’t explain what I feel  
I’m ready for eternity  
I won’t let you down, I won’t hurt you  
From then (From then), until now  
It’s you and me  

**[Instrumental Bridge]**  

**[Outro: Moira Dela Torre, Jason Marvin, Both]**  
And now, you’re here  
I’ll always hold your hands  
You won’t be alone in hardship and ease, I will love you  
From then until now  
From now until the end  
It’s you and me
