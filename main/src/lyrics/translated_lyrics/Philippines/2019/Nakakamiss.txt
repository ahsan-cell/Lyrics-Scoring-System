**Translated Lyrics:**

Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Verse 1: Dello, Flict G, Curse One]**  
So much has happened, years have passed  
Jamming with friends, just reminiscing  
Now I remember, I wish we could relive that (I just miss it)  
I can't help but smile  
When I think of these moments  
So sweet to look back on, the joy of what’s gone (I just miss it)  

**[Chorus: Curse One, Smugglaz]**  
After all this time  
How have you been? How is she?  
What’s up with the rest of the crew now?  
Drinking, joking, teasing, laughing  
I just miss it  

**[Verse 1: Curse One, Smugglaz]**  
How have you been, Smugg? I'm doing fine, Curse!  
How about you, Curse? I'm good, Smugg!  
Thanks for making another one with me  
Another song that doesn’t just stir emotions  
But also shares every moment  
That adds to our lives  
Even if we’re not like we used to be  
Hanging out on the streets when we had free time  
Yeah, I wish we could go back  
To our past  
You’d see what’s missing now  
Things from then that can’t be revisited  
(What a beautiful sight) So nice to behold  
(What a beautiful sight) Of the days gone by  

**[Verse 2: Curse One, Smugglaz]**  
Behind the paths I’ve walked, shaped by my fate  
Imprints of the days, in my experiences I’ve learned  
What’s right and wrong, wait a second, how are the others?  
Some are famous, some have moved up  
Some already have kids  
I hope we don’t forget each other  
No matter what happens, brother or friend  
No matter how many times we fall, let’s keep chasing our dreams  
Whatever happens, don’t give up  
Our dreams for tomorrow  

**[Chorus: Curse One, Smugglaz]**  
After all this time  
How have you been? How is she?  
What’s up with the rest of the crew now?  
Each has their own life, I hope you’re always happy  
Wherever you are or whatever you’re doing  
I hope you always remember the times we had  
Sometimes, sometimes  
Drinking, joking, teasing, laughing  
I just miss it  

**[Verse 3: Flict-G, Dello]**  
How are you, Dells, are you okay?  
I’m good, Flict, always vibing with the crew  
So many pretty girls taking pictures  
Suddenly I miss those playful memories  
Hanging out with friends under the guava tree  
Back then, we played hide and seek, no games, just Dota  
Drinking together, laughter echoing  
It feels like now I long to be with them  
Because I remember the hangouts in the neighborhood  
Partners in all kinds of mischief  
But there was support in facing problems  
It felt good to have someone by your side  
I experienced that back then, wait, where is it now?  
Time, back then, felt like we were in a well  
Full of drinks, holding onto the bucket  
I smile because I suddenly miss that  

**[Verse 4: Dello, Flict-G]**  
And you, Flict? Hey, Dello!  
You seem deep in thought? Huh? Yeah  
I just can’t help but think  
About these things, which ones?  
The ones where I wish we could relive the old days  
Unaware of the things  
That brought sadness to each other  
Endless love, only games were our passion  
Young souls wandering in a garden full of melodies  
Dreaming that all the stars  
Could be held in my hands  
And all failures would be forgotten  
Carried away by the flow of life  

**[Chorus: Curse One, Smugglaz]**  
After all this time  
How have you been? How is she?  
What’s up with the rest of the crew now?  
Each has their own life, I hope you’re always happy  
Wherever you are or whatever you’re doing  
I hope you always remember the times we had  
Sometimes, sometimes  
Drinking, joking, teasing, laughing  
I just miss it  

**[Outro: Dello, Curse One, Smugglaz, Flict-G, *Curse One & Smugglaz*]**  
So much has happened, years have passed  
Jamming with friends, just reminiscing
