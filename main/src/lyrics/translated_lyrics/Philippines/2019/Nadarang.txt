**Translated Lyrics:**

You're here again  
Why can't I help but gaze at your light?  
Once more, I'm drawn to your fire  
Why do I always let it happen?  
You're here again  
Why can't I help but gaze at your light?  
Once more, I'm drawn to your fire  
Ready to get hurt if necessary  

[Verse 1: Shanti Dope]  
Do you have plans later? Can I join you for a stroll?  
If you can't make it, I have things to do as well  
Maybe you're wondering why I'm checking in?  
You've been in my dreams for days, I'm just worried where you might go  
But you seem fine, so I won't bother you anymore  
How many "Our Fathers" do I need to say? So you can worry about me in secret (Uh)  
While they only fantasize about your mascara at night and your wallet in the morning  
You, behind the makeup, still mean "paradise" to me  
Why is it that my treasure is still recognized? Your laughter  
Even if your heart has room for dozens now  
Fate has long denied me, so losing hope isn't new to me  
It's one in the morning again, just call me back when you're no longer together  

[Chorus: Klumcee]  
You're here again  
Why can't I help but gaze at your light?  
Once more, I'm drawn to your fire  
Why do I always let it happen?  
You're here again  
Why can't I help but gaze at your light?  
Once more, I'm drawn to your fire  
Ready to get hurt if necessary  

[Verse 2: Shanti Dope]  
Do you have plans later? I hope you can pass by after  
Just tell me now that I can count on you, your shoes will take you here  
If tonight is the only reason, I'm still ready to lose my breath  
Even if you're comfortable, I'll help you find joy in a more entertaining way  
Why did you reach out? Maybe you’re not being bothered anymore  
Why doesn’t he know your worth and how sweet you are?  
I tried to avoid craving while hiding the struggle of neglect  
When desire calls, let’s play heaven and earth without stakes  
Eye to eye, mouth to mouth, the sounds only we can hear  
Smiling, I drifted off in bed, but why were you gone by morning?  

[Chorus: Klumcee]  
You're here again  
Why can't I help but gaze at your light?  
Once more, I'm drawn to your fire  
Why do I always let it happen?  
You're here again  
Why can't I help but gaze at your light?  
Once more, I'm drawn to your fire  
Ready to get hurt if necessary
