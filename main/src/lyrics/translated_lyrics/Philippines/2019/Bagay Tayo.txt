**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Jom]**  
I won't hesitate if I want you  
I can see the joy in your eyes  
Whenever I'm with you, whenever we're together  
Admit it, the two of us really are meant to be  

**[Post-Chorus: Jom]**  
We are meant to be, we really fit together  
We are meant to be, just the two of us  
Hold my hand  
And we'll fly away together, oh, oh  

**[Verse 1: Crakky]**  
You've been running through my mind for a while now  
I can't stop thinking about you  
Only your pictures are what I want to see  
When I close my eyes in my dreams  
It's just the two of us  
I don't want to be just a fantasy  
If we can truly fulfill this together  
Just the two of us in a destined paradise  
In love with you, what more could I ask for? Nothing, right?  
Your eyes shine like stars above  
I'm drawn to you, can you take me out?  
Let's go to a place where our story can unfold  
Let’s not put off our tale for tomorrow  
I don’t want to leave alone again  
I want to return with you by my side  
Do you know I'm afraid to love anyone else?  
But since I met you, I've forgotten all that  

**[Chorus: Jom]**  
I won't hesitate if I want you  
I can see the joy in your eyes  
Whenever I'm with you, whenever we're together  
Admit it, the two of us really are meant to be  

**[Post-Chorus: Jom]**  
We are meant to be, we really fit together  
We are meant to be, just the two of us  
Hold my hand  
And we'll fly away together, oh, oh  

**[Verse 2: Clien]**  
Oh, do you know that we are meant to be?  
I love you so much, it wasn't really planned  
Your beauty has such a strong effect  
I never expected it to turn out like this  
I hope you'll grant me this wish  
I can't bear my love for you  
Wherever we meet, I'll be here  
Don't worry as long as I'm with you until the end  

**[Chorus: Jom]**  
I won't hesitate if I want you  
I can see the joy in your eyes  
Whenever I'm with you, whenever we're together  
Admit it, the two of us really are meant to be  

**[Post-Chorus: Jom]**  
We are meant to be, we really fit together  
We are meant to be, just the two of us  
Hold my hand  
And we'll fly away together, oh, oh  

**[Verse 3: Russell]**  
You know that every time I see you  
All my fatigue just disappears  
I always seek the sweetness of your smile  
Whenever I'm wrapped in my fears  
You're the reason I keep going  
Doing things even when I make mistakes  
I only believe in you, even though  
Many say all sorts of things  
I’ll cherish the moments when it's just us  
Being with you feels like I'm in the clouds  
I wouldn't want to find anyone else  
Because you answered my dreams  
I can't wait for your arrival  
Just remember, no matter where we go  
There's a vow between you and me  
A promise that no matter what happens, I won't stray, yah  

**[Chorus: Jom]**  
I won't hesitate if I want you  
I can see the joy in your eyes  
Whenever I'm with you, whenever we're together  
Admit it, the two of us really are meant to be  

**[Post-Chorus: Jom]**  
We are meant to be, we really fit together  
We are meant to be, just the two of us  
Hold my hand  
And we'll fly away together, oh, oh  

**[Verse 4: Jom]**  
Do you know that when you're here, my heart races?  
And why are you always on my mind?  
When I open my eyes, you're who I seek  
At night, you're in my dreams  
I know I keep repeating everything I say  
Because I can't explain what I feel  
I hope to be with you  
So you can see how I cherish you  
And show that you and I are truly meant to be  
No matter what happens, as long as we're together  
That's all that matters  

**[Chorus: Jom]**  
I won't hesitate if I want you  
I can see the joy in your eyes  
Whenever I'm with you, whenever we're together  
Admit it, the two of us really are meant to be  

**[Post-Chorus: Jom]**  
We are meant to be, we really fit together  
We are
