**Translated Lyrics:**

Star, star, star  
I see the sparkle of the stars in your eyes  
Star, star, star  
I found the shine of your eyes in the stars  

[Verse 1]  
Maybe my heart is shaking too fast  
For your heart to keep up  
Maybe I’m just being stubborn, refusing to listen  
To the flow of my thoughts, I can’t force it  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It feels like I’m floating in the sky  
But drowning in your smiles  

[Chorus]  
And if this is really where our journey ends  
I won’t abandon the path we’ve walked together  
And if we reach the very end  
Hold on tight, we’ll reach for the stars  

[Post-Chorus]  
Star, star, star  
I see the sparkle of the stars in your eyes  
Star, star, star  
I found the shine of your eyes in the stars  

[Verse 2]  
Perhaps tomorrow will change  
The direction of what you desire  
But can you be mine, even if just for a moment?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It feels like I’m floating in the sky  
But drowning in your smiles  

[Chorus]  
And if this is really where our journey ends  
I won’t abandon the path we’ve walked together  
And if we reach the very end  
Hold on tight, we’ll reach for the stars  

[Post-Chorus]  
Star, star, star  
I see the sparkle of the stars in your eyes  
Star, star, star  
I found the shine of your eyes in the stars  

[Bridge]  
Even if I wasn’t placed in this world for you  
It feels like the whole universe is watching when you hold me close  

[Chorus]  
And if this is really where our journey ends  
I won’t abandon the path we’ve walked together (I won’t abandon)  
And if we reach the very end  
Hold on tight  
We’ll reach for the stars  

[Post-Chorus]  
Star, star, star (Star)  
I see the sparkle of the stars in your eyes  
Star, star, star  
I found the shine of your eyes in the stars  

[Outro]  
Ha, ah-ah-ah (Ha, ah-ah-ah)  
Ha, ah-ah-ah (Ha, ah-ah-ah)  
I see the sparkle of the stars in your eyes  
I see it in your eyes (Ah-ah-ah)  
I found the shine of your eyes in the stars
