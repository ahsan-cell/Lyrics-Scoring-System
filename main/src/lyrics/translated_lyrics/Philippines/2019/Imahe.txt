**Translated Lyrics:**

Coloring the mind, back to the past  
Don't look back, you'll only keep getting hurt  
I never stopped thinking of a beautiful image  
Repeatedly mentioning the name I've grown accustomed to  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
We were brought together, but it wasn't meant to be  
This world is truly playful  

**[Chorus]**  
Forgotten even while in pain  
For the sake of my own well-being  
Forgotten even while in pain  
Moments that can never be reclaimed  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Brought together, but not destined  
Our hearts do not belong to each other  

**[Verse 2]**  
What we once had can no longer return  
The sweetness of your kiss can no longer be felt  
Promises made to each other can no longer live on  
Goodbye to our love that was once united  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
We were brought together, but it wasn't meant to be  
This world is truly playful  

**[Chorus]**  
Forgotten even while in pain  
For the sake of my own well-being  
Forgotten even while in pain  
Moments that can never be reclaimed  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Brought together, but not destined  
Our hearts do not belong to each other  

**[Instrumental Bridge]**  

**[Chorus 2]**  
Forgotten even while in pain  
For the sake of my own well-being  
Forgotten even while in pain  
The love that we wasted  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Brought together, but not destined  
This is where we end  

**[Chorus]**  
Forgotten even while in pain  
For the sake of my own well-being  
Forgotten even while in pain  
Moments that can never be reclaimed  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Brought together, but not destined  
Our hearts do not belong to each other
