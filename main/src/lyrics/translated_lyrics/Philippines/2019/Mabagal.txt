**Translated Lyrics:**

I want to dance with you slowly  
I want to dance with you slowly  
Hand in hand, eyes closed  
Moving along with the music  
I want to dance with you slowly  

[Verse 1: Daniel Padilla]  
Here comes the song we've been waiting for  
Here comes the chance to tell you  
What my heart feels  
I've wanted to say this for a long time  

[Chorus: Daniel Padilla]  
I want to dance with you slowly  
I want to dance with you slowly  
Hand in hand, eyes closed  
Moving along with the music  
I want to dance with you slowly  

[Verse 2: Moira dela Torre, Both]  
I'll place your hand on my waist  
Our bodies swaying to the rhythm of the song  
And slowly our skins will touch  
I've wanted this to happen for a long time  

[Chorus: Both, Daniel Padilla, Moira dela Torre]  
I want to dance with you slowly  
I want to dance with you slowly  
Hand in hand (Hand in hand)  
Eyes closed (Eyes closed)  
Moving along (Moving along)  
With the music  
I want to dance with you slowly  

[Bridge: Daniel Padilla, Moira dela Torre, Both]  
When our song is over (When our song is over)  
And there's no more music (Music)  
I'll sing to you acapella in your ear  
And we'll savor our togetherness  

[Chorus: Both]  
I want to dance with you slowly  
Hand in hand, eyes closed  
Moving along with the music  
I want to dance with you slowly
