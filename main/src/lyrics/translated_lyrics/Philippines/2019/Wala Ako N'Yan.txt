**Translated Lyrics:**

I'm so far away  
From him, from you  
I always bow my head  
But my eyes are fixed on you  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I've accepted it  
That no matter what, I will never be her  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m not that, I’m not that  
You will never love me  
Not now, not ever  
But my heart can't be restrained  

**[Verse 2]**  
It's already one in the morning  
But I'm still holding back the tears  
I'm not begging  
I know it, I know it  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m not that, I’m not that  
You will never love me  
Not now, not ever  
But my heart can't be restrained  

**[Bridge]**  
This is all I can give  
This is all I can express  
It's not enough, whenever that may be  
It's still lacking, it's still lacking  
It's still lacking  

**[Chorus]**  
I’m not that, I’m not that  
You will never love me  
Not now, not ever  
But my heart can't be restrained
