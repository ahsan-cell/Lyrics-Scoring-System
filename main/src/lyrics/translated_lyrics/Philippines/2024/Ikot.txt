**Translated Lyrics:**

Just going around in circles since I felt shy  
Because of your gaze and smile  
Unintentionally falling, losing my mind  
Hoping that we’ll end up together in the end  

[Verse 1]  
Should I admit it?  
Or will it just suddenly disappear?  
Whatever stands between us two  
Do you ever think  
In the moments we’re together  
What we mean to each other in life?  

[Chorus]  
Just going around in circles since I felt shy  
Because of your gaze and smile  
Unintentionally falling, losing my mind  
Hoping that we’ll end up together in the end  

[Verse 2]  
Day and night  
Only you are on my mind  
Even in my dreams, it’s you  
My wish is  
To grow old with only you by my side  
For a lifetime, I choose you  

[Chorus]  
Just going around in circles since I felt shy  
Because of your gaze and smile  
Unintentionally falling, losing my mind  
Hoping that we’ll end up together in the end  

[Interlude]  
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  

[Bridge]  
I keep saying it over and over  
But I don’t really stand by it, oh-oh  
Always second-guessing  
I keep telling myself the things  
I can’t say to you  

[Refrain]  
It’s only you that my heart is shouting for  
A heart that can’t find peace  
It’s only you that my heart is shouting for  
I hope you notice my love  
It’s only you that my heart is shouting for  
A heart that can’t find peace  
It’s only you that my heart is shouting for  
I hope you notice my love  

[Chorus]  
Just going around in circles since I felt shy  
Because of your gaze and smile  
Unintentionally falling, losing my mind  
Hoping that we’ll end up together in the end
