**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, I’m left speechless when I see you  
Oh, can’t tell who will go first—  
Is it me or someone else?  
I have no questions, but you have the answers  
Wherever this leads, I’m not afraid  
If staying is the only remedy  
I might not be able to give it, baby  

[Verse: Kristina Dawn, HevAbi, Kristina Dawn & HevAbi]  
I hope you understand that I’m not ready yet  
Oh, I feel the same, don’t look at me like a threat  
So even if it’s hard for both of us  
Oh, don’t be dramatic, I don’t want you to be combative  
Oh, that’s just how you are  
Hard to find, but twice is enough  
Oh, that’s how you are, only checking in when you have nothing to do  
The things we don’t want, if you’re gone, I can’t handle it  
And I don’t want to be without you, baby, I want you to be mine  

[Chorus: Kristina Dawn & HevAbi]  
I’m left speechless when I see you  
Oh, can’t tell who will go first—  
Is it me or someone else?  
I have no questions, but you have the answers  
Wherever this leads, I’m not afraid  
If staying is the only remedy  
I might not be able to give it, baby  
Oh, I’m left speechless when I see you  
Oh, can’t tell who will go first—  
Is it me or someone else?  
I have no questions, but you have the answers  
Wherever this leads, I’m not afraid  
If staying is the only remedy  
I might not be able to give it, baby
