**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Do you know that my heart almost  
Gave up once again?  
Time and time again,  
It has been hurt, it has failed.  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Looks like I'm in danger again,  
Oh, why am I feeling giddy once more?  
But now it feels different,  
When I look into your eyes, the world is calm.  

**[Chorus]**  
Now that you're here, I won't rush,  
You're the only one beside me until our hair turns gray.  
I won't search for answers to any questions,  
Because you are my certainty.  
I will never let go, now that you are my dance partner.  
If there’s any color to my guiding light,  
You, you are yellow.  

**[Verse 2]**  
I never thought I would feel again  
The embrace of time while  
The warmth and rays of the sun touch me  
(In the shade of the clouds).  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Looks like it's not dangerous after all,  
Because I feel like I'm smiling again (smiling again).  
So now I won’t worry,  
No matter what they say.  

**[Chorus]**  
Now that you're here, I won't rush,  
You're the only one beside me until our hair turns gray.  
I won't search for answers to any questions,  
Because you are my certainty.  
I will never let go,  
Now that you are my dance partner.  
If there’s any color to my guiding light,  
You, you are yellow.  

**[Interlude]**  
(You, you, you)  

**[Chorus]**  
Now that you're here, I won't rush,  
You're the only one beside me until our hair turns gray.  
I won't search for answers to any questions,  
Because you are my certainty.  
Now that you're here, I won't rush,  
You're the only one beside me until our hair turns gray (until our hair turns gray).  
I won't search for answers to any questions,  
Because you are my certainty (you, you, you).  
I will never let go, now that you are my dance partner (now that you are my dance partner).  
If there’s any color to my guiding light,  
You, you are yellow.
