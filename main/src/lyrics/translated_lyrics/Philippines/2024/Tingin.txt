**Translated Lyrics:**

Slowly now  
Even in the middle of the road  

[Verse 1: Raphaell Ridao, Gian Bernardino]  
Moments created, a unique touch  
Of the light on your brown skin  
Oh, where are you taking me?  
Every smile that suddenly fades, you painted it  
The mystery in your gaze captivates  
Wherever I may go  

[Chorus: Raphaell Ridao, Gian Bernardino]  
Ignoring the noise beside me  
In this chaotic environment  
My eyes are only on you  
Not paying attention, you'll spin me around  
Just slowly now  
Even in the middle of the road  

[Verse 2: Janine Teñoso, Gian Bernardino & Raphaell Ridao]  
In every moment that I watch you  
A tickling sensation comes that I can't understand  
No words, can't mention  
In my mind, it's only you that leaves a mark  
Even if my words fall short, my eyes reveal  
Only to you will I surrender, I won't let go  
Please don’t slip away (You won’t slip away)  

[Chorus: Janine Teñoso]  
Ignoring the noise beside me  
In this chaotic environment  
My eyes are only on you  
Not paying attention, I'll be spun around  
Just slowly now  
Even in the middle of the road  

[Interlude: Janine Teñoso]  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

[Bridge: Raphaell Ridao, Gian Bernardino, Janine Teñoso & Gian Bernardino]  
Though I don't know what’s coming  
At the end and in the midst of darkness  
I’m looking at your light  
Looking at you, my eyes are only on you  
Though I don't know what’s coming  
At the end and in the midst of darkness  
I’m looking at your light  
Looking at you, my eyes are only on you  

[Chorus: Raphaell Ridao, Gian Bernardino & Janine Teñoso, Gian Bernardino, Janine Teñoso, *All*]  
Ignoring the noise beside me  
In this chaotic environment  
My eyes are only on you  
Not paying attention, you'll spin me around  
Just slowly now (Slowly now)  
Even in the middle of the road  
(Ignoring) Ignoring, (the noise beside me) the noise beside me  
(In this chaotic environment) This chaotic environment  
(My eyes are only on you) My eyes are only on you  
(Ignoring) Ignoring, (you'll spin me around) you'll spin me around  
(Just slowly) Just slowly now  
*Even in the middle of the road*
