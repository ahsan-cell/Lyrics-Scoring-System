**Translated Lyrics:**

Beloved, I am hopeful  
Even if we suffer, we are one  
Because the world is sad  
It longs for company  
I will take the joy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if we are in pain, let’s not  
Let go of our love  

[Chorus]  
I’m burning out  
In the fire of your gaze  
Go on, consume me  
I am yours completely  
I’m burning out  
In the heat of your skin  
Your touch speaks volumes  
You are mine, everything  

[Verse 2]  
One day that will come  
I will never tire of having you by my side  
Because my love is for night and day (For night and day)  
It will never fade  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if we are in pain, let’s not  
Let go of our love  

[Chorus]  
I’m burning out  
In the fire of your gaze (In the fire of your gaze)  
Go on, consume me (Go on, consume me)  
I am yours completely (I am yours completely)  
I’m burning out  
In the heat of your skin (In the heat of your skin)  
Your touch speaks volumes (Your touch speaks volumes)  
You are mine, everything (You are mine, everything)  

[Outro]  
Everything  
Everything  
Everything  
Everything  
Everything (I’m burning out)  
Everything (In the fire of your gaze)  
Everything (Go on, consume me)  
Everything (I am yours completely)  
Everything (I’m burning out)  
Everything (In the heat of your skin)  
Everything (Your touch speaks volumes)
