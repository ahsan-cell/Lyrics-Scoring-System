**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, hello there, mysterious one  
I still can't read your true motives, ooh-woah  
You show something different, contrary to your words  
But I don't want to doubt, maybe it's just the beginning  

**[Refrain: Stacey, Aiah]**  
I'll just wait for you to pass by  
I hope it eases my longing  
Trapped in this fairytale  
But I don't wanna wake up from this dream, baby  

**[Pre-Chorus: Colet]**  
I don't want to hope  
In the belief that  
Is there really hope  
That my heart might be granted?  

**[Chorus: Jhoanna, Sheena]**  
Magic mirror, when will you admit  
Your true feelings?  
Magic mirror, what should I do?  
Why is my heart left hanging?  

**[Post-Chorus: Gwen, Mikha]**  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Where has love gone?  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Can you tell me?  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Where has love gone?  
Mirror, mirror  
When will you notice me?  

**[Verse 2: Sheena, All]**  
I don't want to believe (I don't want to believe, ayy)  
That I might be overlooked (Oh, no, oh, no)  
But in your glance, your eyes speak  
I can't pretend, what is this really?  

**[Refrain: Gwen, Mikha]**  
I'll just wait for you to pass by  
I hope it eases my longing  
Trapped in this fairytale  
But I don't wanna wake up from this dream, baby  

**[Pre-Chorus: Jhoanna]**  
I don't want to hope  
In the belief that  
Is there really hope  
That my heart might be granted?  

**[Chorus: Maloi, Stacey]**  
Magic mirror, when will you admit  
Your true feelings?  
Magic mirror, what should I do?  
Why is my heart left hanging?  

**[Post-Chorus: Aiah, Colet]**  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Where has love gone?  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Can you tell me?  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Where has love gone?  
Mirror, mirror  
When will you notice me?  

**[Bridge: Mikha, Stacey, Jhoanna, Aiah, (All)]**  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Please tell my prince charming, I'm waiting for his call  
Why all the twists and turns? It feels like a game  
I really can't get it, what is your next move?  
I just want to know (To know)  
What is the truth? (Oh, my)  
Better say it now, it's not too late  
I'm ready to be called your princess, hey (Hey)  

**[Pre-Chorus: Maloi]**  
I don't want to hope  
In the belief that  
Is there really hope  
That my heart might be granted?  

**[Chorus: Gwen, Colet, (Maloi)]**  
Magic mirror, when will you admit (Oh, admit)  
Your true feelings? (What will you say?)  
Magic mirror, what should I do? (Do)  
Why is my heart left hanging?  

**[Post-Chorus: Gwen/Aiah/Maloi/Stacey, Colet/Jhoanna/Sheena/Mikha]**  
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Mirror, mirror, mirror)  
Where has love gone? (What to do?)  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Can you tell me?  
Mirror, mirror on the wall  
Where has love gone?  
Mirror, mirror  
When will you notice me? (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
