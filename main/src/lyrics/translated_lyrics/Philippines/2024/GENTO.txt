**Translated Lyrics:**

I want some, I get some, no later  
I woke up and baked that potato  
Got carbed to shape me for major  
But I stay me, not mediocre  
Look at me, tell me what you see  
All Gucci? But the real question is, "Who's really me?"  
A movie's definitely not my reality  
'Cause you see, "Marumi, marumi, marumi"  
Ewww, gross  

[Pre-Chorus: Stell, Justin, Pablo]  
Yeah, I'm gonna see you later (Later)  
After I take a shower (Shower)  
I can feel the power (Power)  
But the haters still lack the sour, so  
Let’s figure out the details  
No room for pests in my house  
They say the strong stay quiet  
But when they snap, they really make noise (Like this)  

[Chorus: Ken, Pablo]  
Like this, like this  
This isn’t just a simple bingo  
You need to complete it like a bento  
Like this, so, can you handle it?  
Digging deep just to find gold  
Even if there’s no stop, a hundred percent  
With every move I make, can you do this?  
You won’t easily find something like this  

[Post-Chorus: Pablo]  
Like this, mm, yeah, yeah, like this, like this  
You won’t easily find something like this  

[Verse 2: Josh, Pablo, Ken]  
I don’t need to swallow stones anymore  
This isn’t like Darna, my engine will run  
The only mechanic is me, no money, no fun  
With all I’ve been through, my story has piled up  
Nosy gossipers, come and climb up here, uh  
It’s not really easy, whether I admit it or not  
Behind the hidden sobs, my wealth is pain  
This is stale, always alert, even if it’s Mephisto  
I fold when I go beast mode, dressed to impress  
No rush, I can do this all day (No rush)  
Twenty-four mentality like Kobe (Mamba)  
The harder I work, the harder I play  
There’s no "home court" for me, I’ll slam even away  
Here it comes, here it comes, no more chatter  
When I rise up, I’ll shout, "Down, down!"  
I come from the ground  
Even if you try to dig me up, you won’t get me  

[Pre-Chorus: Justin, Stell]  
Yeah, I know this isn't over (Over)  
The disaster isn’t finished (Disaster)  
I know, I'm in danger (Danger)  
But I bet you soon it’ll get better, so  
Let’s figure out the details  
No lounging in my house  
Everyone who raises an eyebrow  
Will be burned by those who learn to reflect  

[Chorus: Josh, Justin, Stell]  
Like this, like this (Ooh, yeah)  
This isn’t just a simple bingo  
You need to complete it like a bento (Oh-oh)  
Like this, so, can you handle it? (Like this)  
Digging deep just to find gold (Ooh-ooh)  
Even if there’s no stop, a hundred percent (Oh-woah)  
With every move I make, can you do this? (Can you?)  
You won’t easily find something like this  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Outro: All, Pablo]  
Dig it up like this  
Don’t stop at the ordinary  
Keep digging until you bleed  
You won’t easily find something like this  
Like this, like this, like this, like this, like this, like this (Ahh, like this)  
Dig it up like this (Like this, like this)  
Don’t stop at the ordinary (Like this, like this)  
Keep digging until you bleed  
You won’t easily find this.
