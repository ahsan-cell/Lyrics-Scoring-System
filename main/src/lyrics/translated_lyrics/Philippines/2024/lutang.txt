**Translated Lyrics:**

If it were up to me to choose  
If I could turn back the hands of time  
Or fly in the wind to catch a glimpse of my future  
I wouldn’t hesitate  
I want to talk to myself, hmm-hmm  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But how long will I suffer?  
What if there’s no certainty?  

[Chorus]  
Ah, I just want to float around  
To be carried by the gentle breeze  
It’s exhausting to be filled with worries, ah-ah  
I think I need to learn how to breathe, ah-ah  

[Verse 2]  
Since my childhood, I’ve always pressured myself  
I forgot how to enjoy, ah-ah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But how long will I suffer?  
What if there’s no certainty?  

[Chorus]  
Ah, I just want to float around  
To be carried by the gentle breeze  
It’s exhausting to be filled with worries, ah-ah  
I think I need to learn how to breathe, ah-ah  

[Outro]  
What if there’s no certainty?  
What if there’s no certainty?  
What then? (What if there’s no certainty?)  
What then? (What if there’s no certainty?)  
What then?  
It’s okay, it’s really okay (What if there’s no certainty?)  
It’s really okay  
(What if there’s no certainty?)  
It’s really okay
