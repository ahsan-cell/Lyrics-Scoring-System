**Translated Lyrics:**

Later, I’ll go home (Later, I’ll go home)  
And your dad woke up (Because)  
And he doesn’t know that I’m here in your room (I’m here in your room now)  
[Intro]  
Yeah-yeah, uh (Everything I’ve been searching for, I found in you)  
Woah, woah  
Do you know, girl? (Do you know, girl?)  
Yeah, I promise I’m con— (I promise I’m concerned)  
Yeah, yeah, uh  
Yeah, do you know, girl? (Baby, do you know, girl?)  
Here, I promise I’m con— (I promise I’m concerned)  
Do you know, girl? (You know, uh, uh, uh-huh)  
Yeah (Uh-uh, huh), yeah-yeah, woah, uh  

[Verse 1]  
Do you know, girl (Do you know)  
When you’re not here, I promise I’m concerned (I promise)  
You don’t reply, you still can’t confirm me (What’s up?)  
Don’t you like me because I don’t have a car? (Skrrt!)  
Or don’t you like me because you’re older? (Uh-huh)  
I can’t give you the luxuries and orders you want  
Just bad luck, what I have in hand right now is four pairs (That’s fine)  
I’m just a street kid, you’re all foreigners  
I offered you Red Horse, you replied, “Okurrr” (Okurrr)  
If only you knew  
When you turned your back on me, I almost lost my mind (God damn)  
Your pocket reached me from behind  
Even with two small steps between us, I felt it (Damn you, damn you)  
I wish you felt it too  
No matter the trials, I’m ready for your body  
This is something I’ll stand by, baby, I’m not afraid  
I love you and it’s not just a fling (Oh, yeah, I saw that)  

[Chorus]  
I don’t want to let you go  
Everything I’ve been searching for, I found in you  
Baby, I hope you don’t just set me aside  
Oh, if you only knew  
Baby, I don’t want to let you go  
Everything I’ve been searching for, I found in you  
Baby, I hope you don’t just set me aside  
Oh, if you only knew  

[Verse 2]  
Do you know, girl  
I can’t understand what I’m feeling  
When what’s between your thighs is what I’m carrying  
Your fierceness and fighting spirit fade away  
The stubbornness is gone, but you rise again  
I’m bouncing back, and you say, “Really?”  
Don’t come back with empty pockets (Huh?)  
Don’t come back smelling like a night out  
I accept you, I just can’t help but get hurt  
When it slips into my mind that you might have someone else  
Even if you don’t catch me anymore, please don’t  
It feels like you’re just playing with me  
A little shame wouldn’t hurt, huh?  
And wherever this goes, I hope you’re not frowning  
Our lips meeting  
On a night when you’re alone, wrapped in darkness  
I love you and this isn’t a secret anymore  

[Chorus]  
I don’t want to let you go (Oh, I don’t want to let you go)  
Everything I’ve been searching for, I found in you (I found in you)  
Baby, I hope you don’t just set me aside (Just set me aside)  
Oh, if you only knew (Ooh)  
Baby, I don’t want to let you go (I don’t want to let you go)  
Everything I’ve been searching for, I found in you (I found in you)  
Baby, I hope you don’t just set me aside (Set me aside)  
Oh, if you only knew
