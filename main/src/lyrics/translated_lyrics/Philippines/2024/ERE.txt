**Translated Lyrics:**

All the love  
And time that I gave  
It seems you don’t notice  
How bad I look in your eyes, mm-mm  

[Chorus]  
Oh, right? It’s so damn frustrating  
We’re flying high, and you left me behind  
Oh, right? You made me look like a fool  
We’re flying high, and you left me behind  

[Verse 2]  
You didn’t say right away  
That you had doubts in your mind (Doubts, doubts)  
You deepened  
The wound here in my chest, oh, shit  

[Chorus]  
Hm, right? It’s so damn frustrating  
We’re flying high, and you left me behind  
Oh, right? You made me look like a fool  
We’re flying high, and you left me hanging, hanging, hanging  
And you left me hanging, hanging, ooh, hanging, ooh  
And you left me, ooh  

[Bridge]  
Three billion, you’re the only one I want  
Sorry to him if now I’m not for you  
We’re moving on to our new chapter  
I don’t want to live in a world without us  
Three billion, you’re the only one I want  
Sorry to him if now I’m not for you  
We’re moving on to our new chapter  
I don’t want to live in a world without us  

[Chorus]  
Right? It’s so damn frustrating  
We’re flying high, and you left me behind  
Oh, right? Right? Right? You made me look like a fool  
We’re flying high, and you left me behind  
Hanging, hanging, hanging (Oh, right? It’s so damn frustrating)  
(We’re flying high) And you left me  
Hanging, hanging, oh, hanging (Oh, right? You made me look like a fool)  
(We’re flying high) And you left me  

[Outro]  
Oh, right? It’s so damn frustrating  
We’re flying high, and you left me too  
Right? You even made me look like a fool  
We’re flying high, and you left me
