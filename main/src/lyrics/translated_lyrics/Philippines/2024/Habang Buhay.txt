**Translated Lyrics:**

My beloved, what is it about you  
That when I see you, the world slows down?  
When you smile, it feels like there's someone else,  
When you look at me with your dreamy eyes.  
I can't escape your drowning beauty, oh,  
Come here.

[Chorus]  
Just look into my eyes,  
Don't glance at anyone else.  
You're mine, no one else,  
I'm here for you until we grow old.  
I will love you as long as when you fall,  
I hold on tight, just don’t let go.  
For a lifetime, I am yours.

[Verse 2]  
No one else has ever done this to me,  
But you, the only goddess of my life.  
Don’t be afraid, don’t worry,  
I’m here when you’re all alone.  
I can't escape your drowning beauty, oh,  
Come here.

[Chorus]  
Just look into my eyes,  
Don't glance at anyone else.  
You're mine, no one else,  
I'm here for you until we grow old.  
I will love you as long as when you fall,  
I hold on tight, just don’t let go.  
For a lifetime, I am yours.

[Bridge]  
Even if your back is bent and weary,  
Even if your head is full of gray,  
I will dance with you until our eyes close.  
I have no other wish,  
As long as I'm with you for life.  
I’m content as long as it’s just you by my side,  
You with me.

[Breakdown]  
My beloved, what is it about you  
That when I see you, the world slows down?

[Chorus]  
Just look into my eyes,  
Don't glance at anyone else.  
You're mine, no one else,  
I'm here for you until we grow old.  
I will love you as long as when you fall,  
I hold on tight, just don’t let go.  
For a lifetime, I am yours.

[Outro]  
Just look into my eyes,  
Don't glance at anyone else.  
You're mine, no one else.
