**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, calm down, baby, calm down  
Don't give me a reason to sit next to you  
Oh, calm down, can you please resist?  
Just one smile for me, I’ll really come closer  
And as the vodka hits,  
You get even more intense  
Don’t provoke me too much,  
I won’t be able to say no  
And I don’t care if anyone sees  
This won’t happen again (Woah-oh)  
I won’t allow it if you don’t go home with me, so

[Chorus: Skusta Clee]  
When the party starts to shake,  
So smooth, so wild  
Look at her move,  
Her dance is like a battle cry  
All she needs is her hips,  
Then the conversation’s done  
Men, I wanna see your booty, go  
Left cheek, right cheek  
I wanna see your booty, go

[Verse 2: Illest Morena]  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, Morena)  
My craving is so strong, I’m searching for  
My favorite dinner is your lips  
Are you down? Let’s go, put it on my throat  
We gon' make a movie there, some things I wanna show  
Many have tried me, but you’re the one I chose to taste  
With the music blasting, you’re the only one I want to dance with  
I don’t want you beside me, I want you on top  
With how tight you hold, you can’t let go of me  
So powerful, you can’t resist  
I want to hear my name from your lips  
[?], uh, Illest, yeah  
There are many others, but they’re not you  
When I tell them, yah, baby, grrah  
I want you, are you still hesitating?

[Chorus: Skusta Clee]  
When the party starts to shake,  
So smooth, so wild  
Look at her move,  
Her dance is like a battle cry  
All she needs is her hips,  
Then the conversation’s done  
Men, I wanna see your booty, go  
Left cheek, right cheek  
I wanna see your booty, go  
(Dance, dance, dance)

[Bridge: Skusta Clee]  
Baby girl just move if you wanna, shake if you wanna  
Go ahead and shake, shake, shake it  
Do what you wanna, twerk if you wanna  
Outshine everyone watching  
Shawty, why are you so fine?  
Did you get it from your mama?  
Ass like Coco, high and low, huh?  
I know you’re really fierce, huh?  
I won’t stop until morning

[Chorus: Skusta Clee]  
When the party starts to shake,  
So smooth, so wild  
Look at her move,  
Her dance is like a battle cry  
All she needs is her hips,  
Then the conversation’s done  
Men, I wanna see your booty, go  
Left cheek, right cheek  
I wanna see your booty, go
