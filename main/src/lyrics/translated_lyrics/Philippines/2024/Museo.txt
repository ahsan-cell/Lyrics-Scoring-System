**Translated Lyrics:**

I've been here for hours now  
My friends have already gone home  
Who would have thought  
That I'd be mesmerized by a picture?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Behind the scenery  
It seems like something is calling me  
I didn't even notice  
That footsteps were drawing near

[Chorus]  
I can't help but  
Gaze at your picture  
Even if you don't realize  
You're the only one I want to see  
I may not be able to say  
Even if it's not possible  
Can I just stay?  
You're the only one I want to admire

[Verse 2]  
Your shadow is calling me  
I can also hear your voice  
They say they can't understand me anymore  
That I'm going crazy over a simple picture

[Pre-Chorus]  
Is it possible  
To just stay in this museum?  
I didn't even notice  
Suddenly, I don't want to leave

[Chorus]  
I can't help but  
Gaze at your picture  
Even if you don't realize  
You're the only one I want to see  
I may not be able to say  
Even if it's not possible  
Can I just stay?  
You're the only one I want to admire

[Bridge]  
It's so delightful to behold  
Even if it's been days, years, and months  
Others may not understand  
But it feels like I've sensed magic

[Chorus]  
I can't help but  
Gaze at your picture  
Even if you don't realize  
You're the only one I want to see  
I may not be able to say  
Even if it's not possible  
Can I just stay?  
You're the only one I want to admire
