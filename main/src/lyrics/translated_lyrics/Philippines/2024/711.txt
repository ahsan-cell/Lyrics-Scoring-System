**Translated Lyrics:**

Someday, will I be able to write  
The song that will buy a house in Santa Rosa?  
I’ll put up a 7/11  
On the highway, even though I don’t want to be a capitalist.  
And I’ll buy a car  
Because you said riding a motorcycle is forbidden.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But the truth is, I don’t mind anymore,  
It’s just you, you’re all I think about.  
Because  

[Chorus]  
I want to give  
You the life you desire,  
And I want to give  
You the life you desire.  
And I’ll do anything, oh,  
I want to give  
You the life you desire.  

[Verse 2]  
And someday, I’ll take you  
To Shibuya or to that café with capybaras.  
And we can retire  
In Vancouver, in Canada.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But the truth is, I don’t mind anymore,  
It’s just you, you’re all I think about.  
Because  

[Chorus]  
I want to give  
You the life you desire,  
And I want to give  
You the life you desire.  
And I’ll do anything, oh,  
I want to give  
You the life you desire.  

[Interlude]  
Pa-ra-ra-ra-pa, ra-ra-pa, ra-ra  
Pa-ra-ra-ra-pa, ra-ra-pa, ra-ra  

[Chorus]  
I want to give  
You the life you desire,  
And I want to give  
You the life you desire.  
And I’ll do anything, oh,  
I want to give  
You the life you desire.  

[Outro]  
Pa-ra-ra-ra-pa, ra-ra-pa, ra-ra  
The life you desire.  
Pa-ra-ra-ra-pa, ra-ra-pa, ra-ra  
The life you desire.
