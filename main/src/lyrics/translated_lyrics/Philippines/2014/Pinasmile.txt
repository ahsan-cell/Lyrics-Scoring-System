**Translated Lyrics:**

Find the way again  
To the land where  
Paradise is the feeling  
This is the day we've been waiting for  
I know that even back then  
Hope was never far away  
Because there's a smile in your heart  

Summer's here in the Philippines, smiles are shining bright  
Summer's here in the Philippines, smiles are shining bright  

**PINASmile us**  
Like the sun after the rain  
**PINASmile us**  
Everything feels lighter  
**PINASmile us**  
Your lips say, "Don't you worry"  
**PINASmile us**  
There's a song in your laughter  
Whatever comes our way  

We can do it! We can do it! hey!  
We can do it! We can do it! smile!  

Because of your smile  
The rainbow appears  
Even if hidden in the dark  
This day won't be missed  
You might also like  
Summer's here in the Philippines, smiles are shining bright  
Summer's here in the Philippines, smiles are shining bright  

**PINASmile us**  
Like the sun after the rain  
**PINASmile us**  
Everything feels lighter  
**PINASmile us**  
Your lips say, "Don't you worry"  
**PINASmile us**  
There's a song in your laughter  
Whatever comes our way  

We can do it! We can do it! hey!  
We can do it! We can do it! smile!  

**PINASmile us**  
Like the sun after the rain  
**PINASmile us**  
Everything feels lighter

There's a song in your laughter  
Whatever comes our way  
We can do it! We can do it! hey!  
We can do it! We can do it! smile!  

Just look into each other's eyes  
There are seven thousand reasons to be happy!  
Just look into each other's eyes  
There are seven thousand reasons to be happy!
