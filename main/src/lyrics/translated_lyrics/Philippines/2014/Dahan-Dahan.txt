**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Can one fall in love without getting hurt?  
Can the heart that loves be restrained?  
Dreaming that you might be free,  
I can’t sleep at night, wishing you were by my side.  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, take it slow,  
Take it slow,  
Take it slow,  
Oh, just take it easy, take it slow.  
It’s painful to admit, but I can’t get it out of my mind,  
The kiss that came from heaven, from your lips where it began.  
Take it slow, take it slow,  
(Take it slow, take it slow, ooh)  

**[Verse 2]**  
Is it a mistake for me to make excuses?  
How do I forget our past?  
Is it a sin to love you sincerely?  
Are there tears falling because of joy and happiness?  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, take it slow,  
Take it slow,  
Take it slow,  
Oh, just take it easy, take it slow.  
It’s painful to admit, but I can’t get it out of my mind,  
The kiss that came from heaven, from your lips where it began.  
Take it slow.  

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t rush down this path,  
Our lives are tumultuous.  
I will fight for the right to be happy,  
But now, I’m so confused,  
How did we end up here?  
Right or wrong, can you please tell me?  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, take it slow,  
Take it slow,  
Take it slow,  
Oh, just take it easy, take it slow.  
It’s painful to admit, but I can’t get it out of my mind (I can’t get it out of my mind),  
The kiss that came from heaven, from your lips where it began.  
Take it slow.  

**[Outro]**  
Take it slow, take it slow,  
Take it slow, take it slow,  
Take it slow, take it slow,  
Take it easy, take it slow.
