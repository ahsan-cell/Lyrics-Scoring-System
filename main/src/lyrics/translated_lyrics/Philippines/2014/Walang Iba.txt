**Translated Lyrics:**

How many times have we fought  
Until we hurt each other?  
We’ve lost track of the reason,  
Even the little things we used to talk about  
Suddenly become the cause of our fights.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But even like this,  
We often can’t agree,  
You’re the only one I want to be with  
For my whole life.  

[Chorus]  
Even when you throw all sorts of things at me,  
I still want you.  
Even when you slap me,  
Kick me, and leave me bruised,  
You’re still the one, no one else  
I want to be with,  
No one else, no one else, ahh.  

[Verse 2]  
It started with teasing,  
Until it heated up,  
Another scene of us arguing again.  
Why do we insist on what we can’t understand?  
It’s really not necessary.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But even like this,  
We often can’t agree,  
You’re the only one I want to be with  
For my whole life.  

[Chorus]  
Even when you throw all sorts of things at me,  
I still want you.  
Even when you slap me,  
Kick me, and leave me bruised,  
You’re still the one, no one else  
I want to be with,  
No one else.  

[Instrumental Bridge]  

[Chorus]  
Even when you throw all sorts of things at me,  
I still want you.  
Even when you slap me,  
Kick me, and leave me bruised,  
You’re still the one, no one else  
I want to be with,  
Don’t ever leave,  
Hmm, no one else, no one else.
