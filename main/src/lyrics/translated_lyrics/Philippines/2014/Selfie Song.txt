**Translated Lyrics:**

1, 2, 3, go!

[Verse 1]  
Waking up in the morning, still a lot of sleep in your eyes  
You grab your camera right away  
And take a picture even before you brush your teeth  
Just to get the perfect angle  
I don’t like that, delete it, I look so fat there  
Let’s just use this one, I look thinner in this shot  
Then caption it with "Good morning, everyone"

[Verse 2]  
At the dining table, you see your dish is eggplant omelet  
You take a photo first even though you’re starving  
Then you upload it and share it with your friends  
And ask, "What’s on your plate? Let’s eat together!"

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every move you make has its documentation  
You show all of this to the nation  
If this is your vibe  
Go ahead, baby, just keep clicking

[Chorus]  
Come on, let’s take selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Show the world your beautiful smile  
Selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Being beautiful or handsome, it ain't a crime  
Selfies, selfies too when we have time

[Verse 3]  
There are sad selfies, and there are happy ones  
Some are pouting, imitating a duck  
Selfies in new clothes or a fresh haircut  
There are wacky ones, cute poses, and those pretending to be mad

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every move you make has its documentation  
You show all of this to the nation  
If this is your vibe  
Go ahead, baby, just keep clicking

[Chorus]  
Come on, let’s take selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Show the world your beautiful smile  
Selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Being beautiful or handsome, it ain't a crime  
Selfies, selfies too when we have time

[Bridge]  
Oh, you don’t need anyone’s approval  
To know that you’re beautiful  
What matters is that you’re comfortable with what you have  
Your beauty is unique, so go ahead

[Chorus]  
Let’s take selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Show the world your beautiful smile  
Selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Being beautiful or handsome, it ain't a crime  
Oh, selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Show the world your beautiful smile  
Selfies, selfies, selfies, selfies when we have time  
Being beautiful or handsome, it ain't a crime  
Selfies, selfies too when we have time

[Outro]  
Selfies, selfies too when we have time  
Selfies, selfies too when we have time
