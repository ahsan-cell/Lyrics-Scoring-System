**Translated Lyrics:**

Can we talk about this now?  
After everything we've been through,  
Are you really thinking of giving up  
On all that we've shared?  
It's tight in my heart, the air has been sucked out,  
The strength is fading, feeling so lost.  
Can we think it over, please don’t walk away,  
Maybe there's still a chance to save this.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The night is getting colder,  
Not like it used to be.

[Chorus]  
Is there still hope if you’re ready to give up?  
Should I crumple your picture now?  
Through hardships and ease, we’ve been together,  
But your feelings seem so tired now.  
You and I are just memories,  
If you’re ready to give up.

[Verse 2]  
Every dream we talked about,  
Is it all just going to waste?  
Let me correct my mistakes,  
In these moments, I know you’re confused.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The night is getting colder,  
Not like it used to be.

[Chorus]  
Is there still hope if you’re ready to give up?  
Should I crumple your picture now?  
Through hardships and ease, we’ve been together,  
But your feelings seem so tired now.  
You and I are just memories,  
If you’re ready to give up.

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]  
Is there still hope if you’re ready to give up?  
Should I crumple your picture now?  
Through hardships and ease, we’ve been together,  
But your feelings seem so tired now.  
You and I are just memories,  
If you’re ready to give up.

[Outro]  
Oh-ohh (If you’re ready to give up)  
(Should I crumple your picture now?)  
Oh-ohh (Through hardships and ease, we’ve been together)  
(But your feelings seem so tired now)  
You and I are just memories,  
If you’re ready to give up.
