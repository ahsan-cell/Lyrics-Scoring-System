**Translated Lyrics:**

Is your breathing light now?  
Come back to me  
Is your mind clear, my love?  
Come back to me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You haven't reached out at all  
Since the cool-off, I've lost my mind  

[Chorus]  
Please, don’t be upset anymore  
Come back to me  
I'm sorry, my love, I hurt you  
Come back to me  
Come back to me  

[Verse 2]  
If I just let you go  
You might completely disappear  
I hope you'll grant this wish  
I promise it won't happen again  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I'm just a person like you  
Caught up in the chaos too  

[Chorus]  
Please, don’t be upset anymore  
Come back to me  
I'm sorry, my love, I hurt you  
Come back to me  

[Guitar Solo]  

[Bridge]  
Please don’t trade me away  
Just you and me again, again  

[Chorus]  
Please, don’t be upset anymore  
Come back to me  
I'm sorry, my love, I hurt you  
Come back to me  
Please, don’t be upset anymore  
Come back to me  
I'm sorry, my love, I hurt you  
Come back to me  

[Outro]  
Please, come back to me  
I'm sorry, my love  
Come back to me
