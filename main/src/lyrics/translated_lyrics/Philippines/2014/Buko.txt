**Translated Lyrics:**

I still remember  
When I was just courting you  
Visiting every night  
Just to catch a glimpse of your smile  
And I would tell you, "Tomorrow at seven at our usual spot"  
My day is complete  
Just to hear your melodies  
Even if I don’t know where you are  
With no communication between us  
I’ll wait for you all night long  
Because you are my life  

[Chorus]  
If you think  
That my love will change  
Etch it in stone  
Even if many Christmases pass  
Even if you can’t reach the floor anymore  
Even if you can’t hear me anymore  
You are still my life (Ooh-ooh)  

[Verse 2]  
I still remember  
When I was just dreaming of you  
Picking you up, dropping you off  
Even if I had to pluck the stars from the sky  

[Chorus]  
If you think  
That my love will change  
Etch it in stone  
Even if many Christmases pass  
Even if you can’t reach the floor anymore  
Even if you can’t hear me anymore  
You are still  

[Bridge]  
Every day I will court you  
I will serenade you always  
I will court you  
I will serenade you always  

[Chorus]  
If you think  
That my love will change  
Etch it in stone  
Even if my hair turns white  
If you think  
That my love will change  
Etch it in stone  
Even if many Christmases pass  
If you think  
That my love will change  
Etch it in stone  
Even if many Christmases pass  
Even if my skin wrinkles  
Even if you struggle to open your eyes  
Even if you can’t reach the floor anymore  
Even if you can’t hear me anymore  
You are still (You are still)  
My life
