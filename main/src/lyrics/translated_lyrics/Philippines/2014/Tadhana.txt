**Translated Lyrics:**

In the unexpected  
Meeting of worlds,  
There’s a rare connection,  
You can feel its echo.

[Verse 2]  
Isn’t the pain and everything  
Enough that I would never let you feel?  
Your eyes reveal  
A love that cries out.

[Chorus]  
Why not respond  
To this unfulfilled affection?  
We who hope for north and west,  
You are my destination,  
And as your refuge,  
I will save you.

[Verse 3]  
Where are we headed? (Where are we headed?)  
Barefoot and in wonder,  
The storm of fate  
Brings me to the warmth of your embrace.

[Chorus]  
Why not just say what you can’t admit?  
Should we leave it all to the wind?  
Don’t fear the whispers of your feelings,  
I’m here, listening to you.

[Outro]  
Oh-woah-woah-oh, oh-woah-woah-oh  
Oh-woah-woah-oh, oh-woah-woah-oh  
Oh-woah-woah-oh, oh-woah-woah-oh  
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
