**Translated Lyrics:**

It's been a while since I've lost my spark  
Watching the world go by  
My heart's always been so tough  
Eager to feel something inside  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Though you’re not new to my sight  
Secretly, you’re in my embrace and affection  
In every hiding place  
I can’t hold back the feelings that rise  

**[Chorus]**  
There’s no answer to the question  
Of why you are so important  
No one can compare to you  
There’s no answer to the question  
Of why you are so important  
No one can compare to you  

**[Verse 2]**  
If morning ever comes again  
I hope to hear you once more, hear you once more  
Your smile is all I see  
Even if the room is empty  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are  
You are the sun in the rain  
And in my cloudy mornings  

**[Chorus]**  
There’s no answer to the question  
Of why you are so important  
No one can compare to you  
There’s no answer to the question  
Of why you are so important  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are  

**[Instrumental Bridge]**  

**[Chorus]**  
There’s no answer to the question  
Of why you are so important  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are  

**[Outro]**  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are  
No one can compare to you  
No matter who they are
