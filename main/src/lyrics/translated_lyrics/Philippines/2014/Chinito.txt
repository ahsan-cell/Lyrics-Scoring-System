**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Will you notice someone like me?  
Even if I'm just in the corner of your eyes  
Can you catch a glimpse of me  
Even though I'm not the one in front of you, oh, chinito*  

[Pre-Chorus]  
One day, you'll know too  

[Chorus]  
And if you are laughing  
Do you still see me?  
I forget what I look like  
When I'm talking to you  
I hope you'll listen to me  
So that you can understand  
Because you've captured my sight and feelings  
Oh, chinito  
Chinito  

[Verse 2]  
If you're not sleepy  
If you're not blinded  
Can I know  
Is there still hope in sight?  
Why is the window of your world so hazy?  
Just one smile from you  
Is something I carry home with me  
Oh, chinito  

[Pre-Chorus]  
One day, you'll know too  

[Chorus]  
And if you are laughing  
Do you still see me?  
I forget what I look like  
When I'm talking to you  
I hope you'll listen to me  
So that you can understand  
Because you've captured my sight and feelings  
Oh, chinito  
Chinito  

[Interlude]  

[Outro]  
I hope you'll listen to me  
So that you can understand  
Because you've captured my sight and feelings  
Ah, just keep laughing  
Do you still see me?  
I forget what I look like  
When I'm talking to you  
I hope you'll listen to me  
So that you can understand  
Because you've captured my sight and feelings  
Oh, chinito  
Chinito
