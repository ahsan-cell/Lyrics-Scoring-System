**Translated Lyrics:**

Once upon a time, we dreamed of everything together  
Singing in the wind, with sun-kissed skin  
I still remember back then, fighting over Nintendo  
How sweet it is to revisit our story  
You always came straight to us when you got home  
Playing with little figurines bought for a coin  
Singing the theme song we learned by heart  
How sweet it is to recall those memories  

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Concepcion & Tippy Dos Santos, Tippy Dos Santos]  
You were my companion from way back then  
You are the dream that lasts until now (Until now)  

[Chorus: Sam Concepcion, Tippy Dos Santos, Both]  
Aren't you the queen and I'm your king?  
I'm the princess you always save  
But now so much has changed and happened  
Yet not the way I look at you (Not the way I look at you)  
Just like the da-ra-rat-da-dati  
Da-ra-rat-da-dati, da-ra-rat-da-dati  
Just like before  

[Verse 2: Sam Concepcion, Tippy Dos Santos]  
Back in the day, we always took our siestas together  
And woke up at four-thirty  
Oh, weâ€™d watch our favorite show together  
Oh, how sweet it is to recall those memories  

[Chorus: Sam Concepcion, Tippy Dos Santos, Both]  
Aren't you the queen and I'm your king?  
I'm the princess you always save  
But now so much has changed and happened  
Yet not the way I look at you (Not the way I look at you)  
Just like before  

[Verse 3: Quest]  
Yeah, back then we played house  
Using a tablecloth tied to bamboo  
And we were rivals when we played games  
But it was as sweet as candy when we pretended to marry  
Weren't we pretending to be Marvin and Jolina?  
Sometimes we were Mylene and Bojo Molina  
It would be so nice to revisit those memories  
Especially when we hugged as kids together  

[Bridge: Tippy Dos Santos, Quest, Sam Concepcion, Tippy Dos Santos & Sam Concepcion]  
Like Julio and Julia, we were always together (Never apart)  
We cried together when Sarah was bullied (That can't happen)  
You were the first to knock on my door in the morning (That's love)  
I wish we could return to our past together, ah-ah  

[Chorus: Sam Concepcion, Tippy Dos Santos, Sam Concepcion & Tippy Dos Santos, Quest]  
Aren't you the queen and I'm your king?  
I'm the princess you always save  
But now you're far away and it's unlikely to happen  
My feelings, oh, just whisper them to the wind (Just whisper them)  
Just a dream now (Just a dream now)  
Just like before (Just like)  
The da-ra-rat-da-dati (Just like before)  
Da-ra-rat-da-dati, da-ra-rat-da-dati (Before, yeah)  
Just like (Yeah-hey)  
Da-ra-rat-da-dati, da-ra-rat-da-dati (Oh-oh)  
Da-ra-rat-da-dati  
Just like (Oh-oh-oh)  
Before
