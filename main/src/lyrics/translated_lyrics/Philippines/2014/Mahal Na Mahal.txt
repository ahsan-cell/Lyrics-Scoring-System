**Translated Lyrics:**

If there's someone I should love  
It’s no one else but you  
No one can stop me now  
You’ve revived the rhythm  
And the beat of my heart with your love  
My life has changed again  
Filled with joy (Filled with joy)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In everything, it’s not possible, it can’t be left behind  
Nothing can hold me back, even if a storm comes  
What if you decide to leave on your own?  
How should I feel?  

[Chorus]  
If you were to leave my life  
If your love were to vanish  
What would the world be like?  
If I can’t see you in an hour  
If you’re already so far away  
Does this heart still have life?  
That’s all we can truly accept  
As long as I’m alive  
I love you so much  
More than you think  

[Verse 2]  
You’ve revived the rhythm  
And the beat of my heart with your love  
My life has changed again  
Filled with joy (Filled with joy)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In everything, it’s not possible, it can’t be left behind  
Nothing can hold me back, even if a storm comes  
What if you decide to leave on your own?  
How should I feel?  

[Chorus]  
If you were to leave my life  
If your love were to vanish  
What would the world be like?  
If I can’t see you in an hour  
If you’re already so far away  
Does this heart still have life?  
That’s all we can truly accept  
As long as I’m alive  
I love you so much  
More than you think  

[Bridge]  
I love you so much, I love you so much  
I love you so much  
More than you think  
I love you so much, I love you so much  
I love you so much  
More than you think  

[Chorus]  
If you were to leave my life  
If your love were to vanish  
What would the world be like?  
If I can’t see you in an hour  
If you’re already so far away  
Does this heart still have life?  
That’s all we can truly accept  
As long as I’m alive  
I love you so much  
More than you think, oh-oh-oh
