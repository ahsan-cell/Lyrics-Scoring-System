**Translated Lyrics:**

Joyful days spent with you  
Your sweet teasing that never gets old  
Our time together is filled with happiness  
As if nothing could ever break us apart  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Why has this moment come?  
I’ve heard the news that you’re no longer here  

**[Chorus]**  
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t leave me?  
That you wouldn’t let me be alone?  
Didn’t you say we’d grow old together?  
Why are you suddenly on the other side of life?  

**[Verse 2]**  
What about everything? What about me, us?  
Didn’t you tell me we’d dream together?  
Why did you leave so suddenly without saying goodbye?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
A cold breeze wrapped around me  
Like a sign that you were saying farewell  

**[Chorus]**  
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t leave me?  
That you wouldn’t let me be alone?  
Didn’t you say we’d grow old together?  
Why are you suddenly on the other side of life?  

**[Instrumental Bridge]**  

**[Chorus]**  
Didn’t you say you wouldn’t leave me?  
(On the other side of life)  
That you wouldn’t let me be alone?  
(On the other side of life)  
Didn’t you say we’d grow old together?  
(On the other side of life)  
Why are you suddenly on the other side of life?  

**[Outro]**  
On the other side of life
