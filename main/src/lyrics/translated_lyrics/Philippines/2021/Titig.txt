**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Flow G]**  
I don’t know how I’ll carry this  
Because my gaze, if it’s just a glance, feels incomplete (Ooh)  
I don’t want to keep this to myself  
But it seems I still can’t bring it up to you  
And you might just ignore it and not pay attention  
It feels incomplete even with drinks like beer and gin  
I still lack the courage, where will I borrow it from?  
Even if I get drunk, when I wake up, I’m still a coward  
How can I join if I don’t invite?  
How can I hit if I don’t take a chance?  
Sometimes I think maybe I should just let it go  
But my mind keeps changing every now and then  
And too much hope but lacking confidence  
So it seems unlikely to get a chance (Chance)  
All I want is to be your Popoy, Basha  
That’s been my long-time fantasy  

**[Chorus: MC Einstein]**  
I’ve been following you for a long time, staring and can’t help it  
Not being able to look at you from afar  
And I’m thinking of ways  
To get closer to you, but there’s a distance in between  
How long will I wait if there’s nothing to gain? (Oh)  
In what I do, when I take a chance, I shouldn’t be embarrassed  

**[Verse 2: Yuridope]**  
I’m not just sitting idle, my heart has been beating for you for a long time  
But sometimes it aches (Woo)  
I can’t say it, I’m not just acting  
I just don’t know how to approach  
Because I might get rejected  
So I tell myself not to try  
All of that is just a dream, slap me awake  
So I can wait for the right time  
I’ll just wait because there’s nothing wrong with being patient (Woo)  
If you’re meant for me, then I’ll wait  
Until there’s something to gain  
But nothing will happen especially if I don’t do anything  
And I might just end up waiting in vain  
If I wait for a miracle (Oh)  
It’s not impossible for you to notice me if I’m not hiding  
I just need to be brave  
If I want to stand up  
There’s really no other way  
If I let fear win  
I’ll just be pitiful, only looking from afar  
I need a change because  

**[Chorus: MC Einstein]**  
I’ve been following you for a long time, staring and can’t help it  
Not being able to look at you from afar  
And I’m thinking of ways  
To get closer to you, but there’s a distance in between  
How long will I wait if there’s nothing to gain? (Oh)  
In what I do, when I take a chance, I shouldn’t be embarrassed  

**[Verse 3: Jekkpot, MC Einstein]**  
It’s been a long time if you think about it  
But you don’t know this, who should I blame?  
If not myself for being too afraid of embarrassment  
Even if they call me awkward, I don’t care  
About what those crazy people say who don’t care about feelings  
I hope you feel this too  
That I love you without you knowing  
You’ve captivated me, your beauty is like a fantasy  
That’s my problem, I’m just simple  
How can I make you fall in love? (Make you fall in love)  
I can’t look into your eyes ('Can’t look into your eyes)  
Maybe my approach will go haywire  
But I can’t stop wanting to have you all to myself (All to myself)  
What approach can I use to talk to you? (Talk to you)  
I can’t figure it out, you might be surprised (You might be surprised)  
When I come close, my heart will surely race  
I just want you to know that  
For a long time now, I’ve been  

**[Chorus: MC Einstein]**  
I’ve been following you for a long time, staring and can’t help it  
Not being able to look at you from afar  
And I’m thinking of ways  
To get closer to you, but there’s a distance in between  
How long will I wait if there’s nothing to gain? (Oh)  
In what I do, when I take a chance, I shouldn’t be embarrassed  

**[Outro]**  
I’ve been following you for a long time, staring and can’t help it  
Not being able to look at you from afar  
And I’m thinking of ways  
To get closer to you, but there’s a distance in between  
How long will I wait if there’s nothing to gain
