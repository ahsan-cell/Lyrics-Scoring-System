**Translated Lyrics:**

Even if you don’t say it, I can feel the pretense  
You seem happy, but why does your laughter carry sadness?  
The weight of questions piling up in your mind  
You don’t have to carry it alone  

[Chorus]  
You’re not a waste, there’s no need to regret  
You’re not a waste, there’s no need to prove yourself  
You are important, no matter what they think  
I accept you  

[Verse 2]  
Throw it out into the universe  
A thousand whys that can’t be answered  
You don’t have to carry it alone  

[Chorus]  
You’re not a waste, there’s no need to regret  
You’re not a waste, there’s no need to prove yourself, woah  
You are important, no matter what they think  

[Bridge]  
I accept you  
Even if they turn their backs on you  
I accept you  
Call out your fears  
It’s not too late to heal  
The wounds of your past  
I won’t leave you  

[Chorus]  
You’re not a waste, there’s no need to regret  
You’re not lacking, there’s no need to prove yourself, woah  
You are important  
No matter what they think  
I accept you  
I accept you, woah  
You are important  
No matter what they think  
I accept you  

[Outro]  
I accept you  
I accept you  
I accept you
