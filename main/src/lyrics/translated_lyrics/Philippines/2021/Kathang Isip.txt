**Translated Lyrics:**

Isn’t this what you wanted?
Oh, I’m about to leave
I’ll bury the memories
Along with the sweetness of yesterday
Those nights when time flew by unnoticed
Moments drifting wherever we may end up
Every thrill felt whenever I hold your hand
It’s a misunderstanding, a huge blunder

[Chorus]
I’m sorry
For these fantasies of mine
Seemingly just brought on by my love for you
I’m waking up
From this dream of mine
And finally, I’ll willingly distance myself from you
(I’ll distance myself)

[Verse 2]
How quickly it all began
Just as fast, it disappeared
Can we go back to the start?
So that the lonely heart won’t hope anymore?

[Chorus]
I’m sorry (I’m sorry)
For these fantasies of mine
Seemingly just brought on by my love for you
I’m waking up (I’m waking up)
From this dream of mine
And finally, I’ll willingly distance myself from you
(I’ll distance myself)

[Bridge]
Flowing with the current written by fate
Sometimes it’s meant for you, but sometimes it’s just a tease
Running away, forgetting it all
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Interlude]
But no matter where I look
I catch glimpses of yesterday
And with every breath I take
You’re the one on my mind, my love

[Chorus]
So I’m sorry
For these fantasies of mine
Seemingly just brought on by my love for you
I’m waking up
From this dream of mine
And finally, I’ll willingly distance myself from you
(I’ll distance myself)

[Outro]
Isn’t this what you wanted?
Oh, I’m about to leave
