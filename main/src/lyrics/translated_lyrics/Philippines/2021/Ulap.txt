**Translated Lyrics:**

Alone  
Peering  
Through the window  
Have I fallen short?  
Sitting down  
Drifting away  
From temptation  
So as not to be disturbed  

**[Chorus]**  
You will dance  
On the clouds  
And we will talk  
No need for fortune-telling  
You will dance  
On the clouds  
I won’t let you  
Fall completely  

**[Verse 2]**  
Did I make a mistake (Did I make a mistake)  
With you?  
This remains  
Blank (This remains blank)  
I can hear  
Your voice  
My love is being rebuilt (My love)  

**[Chorus]**  
You will dance  
On the clouds  
And we will talk  
No need for fortune-telling  
You will dance  
On the clouds  
I won’t let you  
Fall completely  

**[Bridge]**  
Oh-oh (La-la-la)  
I want to be with you (La-la-la)  
I’ll take care of everything (La-la-la)  
Just don’t stray away (La-la-la)  
Let’s color (La-la-la)  
Our little world (La-la-la)  
Look at me (La-la-la)  
Breathe in the air (La-la-la)  
Why have I gotten used to this? (La-la-la)  
My mind is affected (La-la-la)  
In my heart (La-la-la)  

**[Chorus]**  
You will dance (Ooh, ooh)  
On the clouds (Ooh, ooh)  
And we will talk (Ooh, ooh)  
No need for fortune-telling (Ooh, ooh)  
You will dance (Ooh, ooh)  
On the clouds (Ooh, ooh)  
I won’t let you (Ooh, ooh)  
Fall completely (Ooh, ooh)  

**[Outro]**  
Alone  
Peering
