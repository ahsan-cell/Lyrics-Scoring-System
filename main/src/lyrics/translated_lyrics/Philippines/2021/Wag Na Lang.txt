**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m moving on, I’m not a game to play  
So if you’re looking to hurt me, please don’t stay  
Maybe think it over before you act this way  
Because you’re worth it, I might just be the one for you (Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)  
I was planning to make you my princess (Princess)  
Even if it means being your servant, that’s no stress  
But you should really start to think  
Because soon enough, my mind might change in a blink  

**[Refrain: MC Einstein]**  
I’m just being careful  
Because I also want to experience  
Being taken care of too  
I don’t want to get hurt, I can’t handle that, so  

**[Pre-Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Choose someone else to hurt  
Someone who can play along  
If you’re looking for a man who understands you  
Sorry, but that’s not me  

**[Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
So if possible, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t  
If you’re just going to hurt me  
That’s what I don’t want, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t  
If you’re just going to hurt me  
That’s what I don’t want, just don’t  

**[Verse 2: MC Einstein]**  
Good thing I know your tricks now  
I’m not someone who will fall for you somehow  
Giving everything you want and desire  
But my heart’s in pieces when you leave me behind  
Thanks, but I’ll pass  
And you can’t take your lies with you  
And the words that no one believes in  
I’ll admit, I almost fell for you  
But we can’t stand together, it’s true  

**[Refrain: MC Einstein]**  
I’m just being careful  
Because I also want to experience  
Being taken care of too  
I don’t want to get hurt, I can’t handle that, so  

**[Pre-Chorus: Skusta Clee]**  
Choose someone else to hurt  
Someone who can play along  
If you’re looking for a man who understands you  
Sorry, but that’s not me  

**[Chorus: Skusta Clee & MC Einstein]**  
So if possible, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t  
If you’re just going to hurt me  
That’s what I don’t want, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t, just don’t (Oh!)  
Just don’t, just don’t  
If you’re just going to hurt me  
That’s what I don’t want, just don’t  

**[Interlude: Skusta Clee with MC Einstein]**  
Pa-ra-ri-rap, pa-rap-pap-pap  
Pa-ra-ri-rap, pa-rap-pap-pap  
Pa-ra-ri-rap  

**[Outro: Skusta Clee, MC Einstein]**  
If you’re just going to hurt me  
That’s what I don’t want, just don’t (Woah-oh-oh, oh-woah, yeah)  
If you’re just going to hurt me  
That’s what I don’t want, just don’t
