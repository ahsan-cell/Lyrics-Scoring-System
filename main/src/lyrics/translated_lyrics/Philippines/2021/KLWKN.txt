**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, how sweet it is beneath the sky  
When I’m with you, gazing into the void  
The moon and stars bear witness to our love  
Just the two of us, just the two of us, ah  

[Verse 1]  
I can still see you, my love  
Though far away, you shine like a star  
Every time I’m with you  
The path lights up in the sparkle of your eyes  

[Pre-Chorus]  
When you’re by my side, my heart feels at ease  
The night becomes sweeter whenever I hold your hand  

[Chorus]  
Oh, how sweet it is beneath the sky  
When I’m with you, gazing into the void  
The moon and stars bear witness to our love  
Just the two of us, just the two of us, ah  

[Verse 2]  
The breeze is so cool against my skin  
Yet it can’t compare to the fire I feel  
Whenever we’re in different worlds  
Just one glance at the moon brings me closer to you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The heavens are smiling, waiting for the moment  
The whole surroundings are excited for our kiss  

[Chorus]  
Oh, how sweet it is beneath the sky  
When I’m with you, gazing into the void  
The moon and stars bear witness to our love  
Just the two of us, just the two of us, ah  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Chorus]  
Oh, how sweet it is beneath the sky  
When I’m with you, gazing into the void  
The moon and stars bear witness to our love  
Just the two of us, just the two of us, ah  

[Outro]  
Come now beneath the sky  
Join me in gazing into the void  
The moon and stars bear witness to our love  
Just the two of us, just the two of us
