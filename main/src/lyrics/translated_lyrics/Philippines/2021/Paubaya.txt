**Translated Lyrics:**

Where did everything start to change?  
When did I become not enough?  
Why didn’t you say it from the very beginning?  
I was the one you needed, but not the one you loved.  

[Verse 2]  
Where did my love fall short?  
I gave everything just to see you smile.  
Why didn’t I see that you no longer wanted me?  
I was by your side, but you were looking for her.  

[Chorus]  
And if you’re happy with her,  
I won’t force you anymore.  
All I wish for her is this:  
Don’t let her make you cry and take care of you.  

[Verse 3]  
Where did the truthfulness stop?  
Every time you mentioned that you loved me.  
Why didn’t you admit there was someone else?  
I was the one holding you, but your mind was on her.  

[Chorus]  
And if you’re happy with her,  
I won’t force you anymore.  
All I wish for her is this:  
Don’t let her make you cry and take care of you.  

[Bridge]  
Why didn’t I think there would be an end?  
I was the first, but she is the conclusion.  

[Chorus 2]  
And I can see it in your eyes  
Why you chose her.  
It’s hard to fight against fate,  
I’m letting go, I’m letting go.  

[Outro]  
I’m letting go to her.
