**Translated Lyrics:**

La-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la-la-la-la  

**[Verse 1]**  
With every step on the ground, I feel like I'm being swept away  
And drowning in the world's criticisms  
In what I can only manage  
Squeezed dry from all the  
Problems that can't be solved right away  
It feels like there's no tomorrow, can I just escape?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Searching for myself but  
I can’t handle this winding path I’m on  
Where is this leading?  
Where am I headed?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Let’s slowly start stepping forward again  
Gently look in the mirror  
To see our own beauty  
Slowly lift your face  
To behold the peaceful sky  

**[Chorus]**  
Yes, you’re tired  
But you’re not alone  
So fight on  
And say, "It's my turn now"  

**[Verse 3]**  
With every breath of air  
I notice there’s always smoke  
Barely anything clean, it’s all pollution  
Like I’m the one consumed  
My mind is so confused, where do I fit if I make a mistake?  
They judge so harshly, are they perfect?  

**[Verse 4]**  
Take a deep breath and think carefully  
About the decisions you’ll make for the future  
So you can reach where you’re meant to go  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Let’s slowly start stepping forward again (Start stepping forward again)  
Gently look in the mirror  
To see our own beauty  
Slowly lift your face  
To behold the peaceful sky  

**[Chorus]**  
Yes, you’re tired  
But you’re not alone (You’re not alone)  
So fight on  
And say, "It's my turn now" (Ooh-ooh-ooh)  
"It's my turn now" (Ah-ah-ah)  

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t let sadness swallow you  
Don’t allow your heart to crumble  
From what others throw at you  
Remember, you are enough  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Slowly take off the mask and  
Let the impending tears flow  
Gently lift your face to  
See the people who truly care for you  

**[Chorus]**  
Yes, you’re tired  
But you’re not alone  
So fight on  
And say, "It's my turn now"  

**[Outro]**  
It's my turn now
