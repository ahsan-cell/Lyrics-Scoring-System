**Translated Lyrics:**

Let’s slow down the world’s rotation  
Stop the hands of time on the clock  
Slowly, just slowly  
Slowly, just slowly  

[Verse 1]  
So much joy because you’re here now  
Even though you’ll be leaving soon  
Please don’t get annoyed, our time is fleeting  
Just rest your sandals for a moment, we’re not in a hurry, right?  
Come closer to me, babe, let’s make the most of the night  
Set aside your problems, let your lips brush against mine  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No matter how deep I dive,  
You won’t be left wanting with what I’ll do  

[Chorus]  
Let’s slow down the world’s rotation  
I’ll dance to your melody, this night is ours  
Stop the hands of time on the clock  
Let’s escape the chaos, flying away from it all  

[Post-Chorus]  
Slowly, just slowly  
Slowly, just slowly  

[Verse 2]  
Just take it slow  
Now I know  
You’re only here for a while  
The clock is my enemy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What will I do at night?  
If only I had someone by my side  
Just rest your sandals for a moment  
We’re not in a hurry, so  

[Chorus]  
Let’s slow down the world’s rotation  
I’ll dance to your melody, this night is ours  
Stop the hands of time on the clock  
Let’s escape the chaos, flying away from it all  

[Post-Chorus]  
Slowly, just slowly  
Slowly, just slowly  

[Outro]  
Oh, can we take a little break?  
Just slowly  
Oh, can we take a little break?  
Just slowly
