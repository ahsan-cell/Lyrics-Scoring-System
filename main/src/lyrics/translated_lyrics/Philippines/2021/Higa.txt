**Translated Lyrics:**

You need to know  
When you are needed  
It feels like you’ve never experienced  
Fighting for yourself instead  
Why do you always set aside  
Yourself for others?  
Yearning for someone who won’t return,  
Try to take a break.

[Chorus]  
And slowly lay your body down,  
So you’ll know you’re not alone.  
Come on, there’s no need to force it,  
Because to me, you are important.

[Verse 2]  
You do have a heart,  
But you don’t see it.  
Even when we’re in the corner,  
You still won’t let me in.  
Do you really need more pushing?  
Oh, it seems I’m just not the one you want.  
Just a little peek into what I feel for you.

[Chorus]  
And slowly lay your body down,  
So you’ll know you’re not alone.  
Come on, there’s no need to force it,  
Because to me, you are important.  
You are important.

[Bridge]  
And slowly,  
And slowly,  
And slowly lay down, woah.

[Chorus]  
And slowly lay your body down,  
So you’ll know you’re not alone.  
Come on, there’s no need to force it,  
Because to me, you are important.  
And slowly lay your body down,  
So you’ll know you’re not alone.  
Come on, there’s no need to force it,  
Because to me, you are important.
