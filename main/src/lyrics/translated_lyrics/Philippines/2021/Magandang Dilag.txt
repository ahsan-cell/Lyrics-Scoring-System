**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, beautiful maiden  
You've captured my heart  
I desire nothing more  
You bring me such joy  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Verse 1: JM Bales]  
Every step you take, everyone is watching  
I can't understand why this is happening to me  
Just one smile from you drives me crazy  
What have you done? I'm completely enchanted  

[Pre-Chorus: JM Bales]  
I gaze at you  
Like a star  
In the vastness of space  

[Chorus: JM Bales]  
Oh, beautiful maiden  
You've captured my heart  
I desire nothing more  
You bring me such joy  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Post-Chorus: JM Bales]  
Oh, beautiful maiden  
My heart is drawn to you  
I desire nothing more  
A blessing from heaven  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Verse 2: JM Bales]  
Even if I try to avoid you  
Oh, you keep circling in my mind  
There's no one else, it's just you  
The only star in my sky, ohh  

[Pre-Chorus: JM Bales]  
I gaze at you  
Like a star  
In the vastness of space  

[Chorus: JM Bales]  
Oh, beautiful maiden  
You've captured my heart  
I desire nothing more  
You bring me such joy  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Post-Chorus: JM Bales]  
Oh, beautiful maiden  
My heart is drawn to you  
I desire nothing more  
A blessing from heaven  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Verse 3: KVN]  
Oh, how do I say that my admiration deepens?  
Like a shooting star, my feelings fall  
No matter what they say, you are my only prayer  
That I wish would come true and be mine  

[Breakdown: KVN with JM Bales]  
I gaze at you  
I hope that fate has brought us together  
Like a shining star  
What a mystery  
Just a glimpse, and Iâ€™m left speechless  
In the vastness of space  

[Chorus: JM Bales with KVN]  
Oh, beautiful maiden  
You've captured my heart  
I desire nothing more  
You bring me such joy  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Post-Chorus: JM Bales]  
Oh, beautiful maiden  
My heart is drawn to you  
I desire nothing more  
A blessing from heaven  
Oh, beautiful maiden  

[Outro: JM Bales]  
I desire nothing more  
You bring me such joy  
Oh, beautiful maiden
