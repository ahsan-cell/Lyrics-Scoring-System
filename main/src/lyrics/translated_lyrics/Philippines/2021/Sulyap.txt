[Chorus: Jr Crown]  
I can't help but fall in love with you  
What is this?  
I always want to see you with my two eyes  
Crazy for you, oh, oh  
So I'm always waiting  
Just to catch a glimpse of you  
Because with just one smile, I'm already okay  
All because of you, oh, oh  

[Verse 1: Jr Crown]  
Always waiting to see where you'll pass by  
Hoping to catch another glimpse of you  
You're so beautiful and your sweet smile  
It's frustrating because I can't get you out  
Of my mind, I can't hold back  
My feelings for you, even if it's just through a stare  
Sometimes, I want to chat with you on FB  
Invite you out and hang out together  

[Pre-Chorus: Jr Crown]  
I can be your Superman, even if I'm not a superhero  
I'll fight for you, no matter who it is  
Yeah, I'm simple and it's hard for you to like me  
So it's okay if you only notice me on FB because  

[Chorus: Jr Crown]  
I can't help but fall in love with you  
What is this?  
I always want to see you with my two eyes  
Crazy for you, oh, oh (Oh, crazy for you)  
So I'm always waiting (Waiting)  
Just to catch a glimpse of you (A glimpse)  
Because with just one smile, I'm already okay  
All because of you, oh, oh  

[Verse 2: Thomé]  
Aye, lady, yeah, I know  
That I'm not the one you should like  
I accept that it's just through a stare  
So maybe through this melody, you'll listen  
Even if I can't say this in front of you  
Just to admit that you're always on my mind  
And carry you into my dreams until I wake up  

[Pre-Chorus: Thomé]  
Maybe it's true, I'm crazy for you, oh-oh  
All I wish is for you to notice me and say  

[Chorus: Jr Crown]  
I can't help but fall in love with you  
What is this?  
I always want to see you with my two eyes  
Crazy for you, oh, oh  
So I'm always waiting  
Just to catch a glimpse of you  
Because with just one smile, I'm already okay  
All because of you, oh, oh  

[Verse 3: Chris Line]  
I don't even know why I can't replace you  
Even though I know it's unlikely you'd like me back  
In this world, I found everything in you that I couldn't find in others  
You're the kind of woman who doesn't need makeup; to me, you're already beautiful  
When you pass by, I'm waiting even if I can't get close  
And when you smile, that's the sweetest thing to look at  
If I have a wish, I'll mention it several times  
"I just want to be with you, no one else, you and you alone"  
Even if it's uncertain to come true, remember I'll take care of you  
I won't let anyone disrespect you; even if I'm skinny, I'm ready to fight for you  
Even if I can't hold your hands, I'll keep waiting  
Even if it's impossible for you to focus your attention on me  

[Chorus: Jr Crown]  
I can't help but fall in love with you  
What is this?  
I always want to see you with my two eyes  
Crazy for you, oh, oh  
So I'm always waiting  
Just to catch a glimpse of you  
Because with just one smile, I'm already okay  
All because of you, oh, oh  

[Outro: Jr Crown]  
I can't help but fall in love with you  
What is this?  
I always want to see you with my two eyes  
Crazy for you, oh, oh
