Yeah  
BB Records  
Ey! Hahahah  
Sawndass Music  

[Chorus: Kath & Jr Crown]  
No matter how far you are, my love, always remember  
My love won't change, it's only for you  
Just trust me, even if the sea separates us  
Nothing can stand in the way of us two  
Even if you are far away  

[Verse 1: Jr Crown]  
My love, how are you?  
Take care always, don’t worry  
Even if I can't be with you now, that’s not a reason  
For me to look for someone else  
Because I’m content, I’m only yours  
You complete my world and build it up  
So there’s no reason for me to stray  
From the woman who has become my life partner  
So just trust me, always remember  
Nothing can come between us  
Even if you are far away, you can be assured  
Until the end, I won’t replace you  

[Pre-Chorus: Jr Crown with Kath]  
So my love, just trust me  
My love won’t change, it’s only for you, even if  

[Chorus: Kath & Jr Crown]  
No matter how far you are, my love, always remember  
My love won't change, it's only for you  
Just trust me, even if the sea separates us  
Nothing can stand in the way of us two  
Even if you are far away  

[Verse 2: Cyclone]  
Two hearts were struck but separated  
Perhaps to strengthen them so they won’t fail  
Hand in hand, we hold onto the promise we made  
That will never waver against tempting distractions  
God plays tricks, testing our strength  
Just to ensure that we are destined  
We can endure everything, just to prove  
My love for you is always true  
Even if there’s distance between us now, don’t cry  
Because we will embrace again, that’s for sure  
I always think of you wherever my steps lead  
Joy will remain as long as I can hold and kiss you again  
Together we’ll savor the fullness of the moon  
Upon my return, we’ll continue  
The love story that we started  

[Chorus: Kath & Jr Crown]  
No matter how far you are, my love, always remember  
My love won't change, it's only for you  
Just trust me, even if the sea separates us  
Nothing can stand in the way of us two  
Even if you are far away  

[Verse 3: Young Weezy]  
Days and nights without you by my side  
It feels strange, I don’t know how  
How I can manage without you here  
The distance between us is so vast  
How can I reach you?  
When there are thousands of spaces between us  
It might take a while for the fog to clear  
To have you with me even if you’re far away  
But no matter what  
Always remember that I’m here for you  
Waiting, ready  
For your return, even if there’s distance between us  
The one thing I’ll send with you  
Is trust and my deep love  
Even with thousands of kilometers apart  
In my heart, you will always remain special  

[Chorus: Kath & Jr Crown]  
No matter how far you are, my love, always remember  
My love won't change, it's only for you  
Just trust me, even if the sea separates us  
Nothing can stand in the way of us two  
Even if you are far away  

[Bridge: Kath with Jr Crown]  
Even if you are far away, it won’t change  
My love is only for you, it won’t fade  
So don’t worry and don’t be anxious  
I won’t break the vow we made  
I will wait to be with you again  

[Chorus: Jr Crown & Kath, Jr Crown, Kath]  
No matter how far you are, my love, always remember  
My love won't change, it's only for you  
Just trust me, even if the sea separates us  
Nothing can stand in the way of us two  
Even if you are far away  
No matter how far you are, my love, always remember  
My love won't change, it's only for you  
Just trust me, even if the sea separates us  
Nothing can stand in the way of us two  
Even if you are far away
