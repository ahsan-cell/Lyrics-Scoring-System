**Translated Lyrics:**

JRoa!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
No, no, oh-oh, woah, woah  
No, no, no, no, no  

[Verse 1]  
Hold my hand (My hand, my hand)  
And I'll take you wherever you want to go  
I’ll be your guide (Your guide, your guide)  
Close your eyes  
And we’ll fly away together  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let’s escape this world  
Just you and me, no one else  
I’m ready to give my all  
My heart is truly only for you  
So hold on tight  

[Chorus]  
In my hand, I’m ready to give  
Everything you desire  
For our journey ahead  
Give me your hand  
I won’t let go, no matter where we go  
This trip is just for us  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

[Verse 2]  
Hold my hand (My hand)  
I’ll be your armor against all your pain  
I’ll be your guide (Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh)  
Open your eyes  
Don’t hold back your joy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Let’s escape this world (This world)  
You can count on me at all times (Count on me)  
I’m ready to give my all (My all)  
So tighten your grip (Your grip)  

[Chorus]  
In my hand, I’m ready to give  
Everything you desire  
For our journey ahead  
Give me your hand  
I won’t let go, no matter where we go  
This trip is just for us  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

[Bridge]  
No matter what happens  
I’ll always be by your side  
Just trust in me  
Don’t let go of your grip  

[Chorus]  
In my hand, I’m ready to give (In my hand)  
Everything you desire  
For our journey ahead (Journey ahead)  
Give me your hand  
I won’t let go, no matter where we go  
This trip is just for us  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh (Ooh-woah, yeah)  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, ooh-woah  

[Outro]  
I won’t let go, no matter where we go  
This trip is just for us
