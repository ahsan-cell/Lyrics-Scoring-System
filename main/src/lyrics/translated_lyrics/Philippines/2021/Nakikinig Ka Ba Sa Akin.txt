**Translated Lyrics:**

I will greet you at the end of your anger  
I will understand you so we won’t become  
An endless epidemic to suppress  
Or a problem that can’t be seen, where’s the culprit?  
Have we become selfish?  
Are our ears closed to each other's wishes?  

**[Chorus]**  
Are you listening to me?  
I don’t want to fight with you  
We share the same desire  
To break the darkness  

**[Verse 2]**  
If there’s something you want to praise  
Go ahead, do that  
If there’s something you want to criticize  
Go ahead, do that  
What matters is that everyone gets heard  

**[Chorus]**  
Are you listening to me?  
I don’t want to fight with you  
We share the same desire  
To break the darkness  

**[Bridge]**  
I’m sorry for my shortcomings  
I hear you  

**[Chorus]**  
Are you listening to me?  
I don’t want to fight with you  
We share the same desire  
To break the darkness  
Are you listening to me?  
Let’s embrace tomorrow  
We share the same desire  
To break the darkness  

**[Outro]**  
Are you listening? (I will greet you at the end of your anger)  
Are you listening?  
Are you listening? (I will greet you at the end of your anger)  
Are you listening?  
I will greet you at the end of your anger
