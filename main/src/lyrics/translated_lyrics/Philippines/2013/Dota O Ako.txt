**Translated Lyrics:**

If Dota were the only one in the world, there are so many GFs
Your GF will leave you too, but Dota won’t
Your GF gets mad when you play Dota
But Dota doesn’t get mad when you have a GF
Dota is happy with just twenty pesos
Your GF might not be happy even with two hundred pesos
When you see another hero, Dota doesn’t get jealous
But when you see another girl, your GF gets angry
If you leave your GF, it’s hard to go back
But if you leave Dota, it’s still ready to accept you
What do you prefer? Dota or GF?

[Chorus: Sabrina]
What will you choose? Dota or me?
What do you prefer?
When I’m with you, that’s what’s on my mind
What do you prefer? Dota or me?
And what am I to you? What’s important?
Do you really love me?

[Verse 1: Aikee]
Let’s play Dota, Defense of the Ancients
Rain or shine, even in boots
Call the squad, let’s start the countdown
Everybody push, get ready for the gangbang (First blood)
Blood spills within three minutes, so quick to build
Just like basketball, make me like Mike
With all my kills, I’ve become Godlike
Go, Tiny Stun, please toss that
After that, let’s go Roshan
Nice strategy, like Menisky
And skills arch psyche, just like Aikee
Destroy the last tower, victory is ours
Let’s break the tree of Mulawin
Good game, maybe next time, sir
Imba sorry, GG now, sir

[Chorus: Sabrina]
What will you choose? Dota or me?
What do you prefer?
When I’m with you, that’s what’s on my mind
What do you prefer? Dota or me?
And what am I to you? What’s important?
Do you really love me?

[Verse 2: Aikee]
When playing, what joy do you feel?
Forgetting problems when you stumble
I’m not being dramatic, look at the difference
When your girlfriend hurts you, your heart breaks
When you have money, when you have TF
Dota costs twenty pesos, the rest goes to GF
But Dota can never love you
It provides entertainment for anyone

[Refrain: Sabrina]
What do you see in Dota that I don’t have?
Can a Dota you speak of love you?
Dota is a game you can play
Don’t compare it to me who gets hurt
What do you see in Dota that I don’t have?
Can a Dota you speak of love you?
Dota is a game you can play
Don’t compare it to me who gets hurt

[Chorus: Sabrina]
What will you choose? Dota or me?
What do you prefer?
When I’m with you, that’s what’s on my mind
What do you prefer? Dota or me?
And what am I to you? What’s important?
Do you really love me?

[Refrain: Sabrina]
What do you see in Dota that I don’t have?
Can a Dota you speak of love you?
Dota is a game you can play
Don’t compare it to me who gets hurt

[Spoken Outro: Aikee]
Dota is an invented game
It’s a pastime for people
But study well first for your future
So that in the future, you can be proud
