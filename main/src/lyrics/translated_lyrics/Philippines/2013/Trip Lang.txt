**Translated Lyrics: "Just for Fun"**

Trip, trip, trip, just for fun (Yo!)  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun (Listen to this)  
Why? (Just for fun)

[Verse 1: Shehyee]  
Come on, let’s go, it’s really easy  
I promise, after this, you’ll still be breathing  
Hurry up, man, it’s about to get bright  
If you don’t join in, you’ll be left behind  
Don’t overthink, keep your mind single, it’s just one  
All it wants is to be happy  
To avoid being judged, steer clear  
Of staying in one place, I mean don’t submit  
To fear, don’t give in  
When it itches, just scratch it  
Think about this, isn’t it true that all your experiences here in the world  
As a person remain the same, nothing has changed  
The happiest moments are those unplanned

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Pinto]  
Because when you don’t know yet (You don’t know yet)  
It’s scary but also exciting! (Exciting, right!)

[Chorus: Sam Pinto, Shehyee]  
Join in, Batman will take care of it  
It’s time to try what hasn’t been done  
It only happens once, so enjoy yourself  
Have fun, be happy, you won’t lose anything (Because)

[Post-Chorus: Sam Pinto]  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun

[Verse 2: Shehyee]  
You want to do something but worry that people will laugh at you  
You want to sing but it’s not your strength, karaoke costs just five pesos  
Go, just in an empty lot  
Just kidding, give it your all, even a little  
Even if it’s just for fun, put everything into what you do  
So that others have nothing to say  
In the world we live in, there are many fools  
You’re not bothered, what do you really need?  
Maybe my fun is your fun too  
You just can’t seem to do it  
If that’s the case, then just ride along  
Don’t worry where it will take you

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Pinto]  
Yeah, when you don’t know yet (You don’t know yet)  
It’s scary but also exciting! (Exciting, right!)

[Chorus: Sam Pinto, Shehyee]  
Join in, Batman will take care of it (Batman will take care of it)  
It’s time to try what hasn’t been done (Go)  
It only happens once, so enjoy yourself (Enjoy, enjoy yourself)  
Have fun, be happy, you won’t lose anything (Because)

[Post-Chorus: Sam Pinto]  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun

[Bridge: Sam Pinto]  
Even if I’m not a great singer, I still have the courage, 'cause  
I’m beautiful, oh, why?  
If you don’t like it, then don’t watch (Just kidding!)  
Don’t get mad, don’t be a buzzkill  
There’s nothing bad about my fun  
If I were you, to be happy on this trip, just join in (Let’s go!)

[Chorus: Sam Pinto, Shehyee]  
Join in, Batman will take care of it (Batman will take care of it)  
It’s time to try what hasn’t been done (Go)  
It only happens once, so enjoy yourself (Enjoy, enjoy yourself)  
Have fun, be happy, you won’t lose anything (Because)

[Outro: Sam Pinto & Shehyee]  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun  
Trip, trip, trip, just for fun
