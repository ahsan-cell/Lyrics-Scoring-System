**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh right, we really aren’t
This is as far as I go
Dreaming of being with you
Not meaning to search for my place
Where exactly am I?
Are you still there with you?

[Chorus]
Dizzy (Dizzy)
Confused
Where do I stand with you?
Should I hope for you?

[Verse 2]
I feel sick, my insides are churning
My knees hurt, must I kneel?
I just want the truth
The kind where the answer isn’t another question

[Chorus]
Dizzy (Dizzy)
Confused
Where do I stand with you?
Where do I stand with you?
Dizzy (Dizzy)
Confused
Where do I stand with you?
Should I hope for you?

[Bridge]
Because I can’t sleep anymore (Sleep anymore)
Can’t eat anymore (Eat anymore)
Because I can’t laugh anymore (Laugh anymore)
Because I can’t anymore
Oh right, we really aren’t
This is as far as I go

[Chorus]
Dizzy (Dizzy)
Confused
Where do I stand with you?
Where do I stand with you?
Dizzy (Dizzy)
Confused
Where do I stand with you?
Should I hope for you?

[Outro]
Dizzy
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Dizzy
Confused
