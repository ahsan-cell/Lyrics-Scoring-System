**Translated Lyrics:**

I will do everything so that  
In the end, in the end, in the end, it’s us  
If I have to traverse  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away (Away, away)  
Yeah, oh-oh, ooh  

[Verse 1]  
Why are we trying to stretch this distance?  
But while there are obstacles, love deepens  
It seems like stars in the sky, the distance is far and you’re out of sight  
But as it grows longer, I shout your name even louder  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even the sea, I will bravely cross  
Even if the waves reach the heavens  
Wherever it may be, I promised I would arrive  
Just to be with you  

[Chorus]  
I will do everything so that  
In the end, in the end, in the end, it’s us  
If I have to traverse  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away (Away, away)  

[Verse 2]  
The world is against us  
And we can’t meet  
Oh, should I listen now?  
Should I just go with the flow?  
Washed away, swept along, and you’re almost out of sight  
After being wrapped in scars  
I still shout your name  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even the sea, I will bravely cross (Oh)  
Even if the waves reach the heavens (Oh)  
Wherever it may be, I promised I would arrive  
Just to be with you (Oh)  

[Chorus]  
I will do everything so that (I will do everything)  
In the end, in the end, in the end, it’s us  
If I have to traverse  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even the sea, I will bravely cross  
Even if the waves reach the heavens  
Wherever it may be, I promised I would arrive  
Just to be with you  

[Chorus]  
I will do everything so that  
In the end, in the end, in the end, it’s us (In the end, it’s us)  
If I have to traverse  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away (Oh-oh)  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away  
(Oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
(Whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa)  
Kilome-kilome-kilometers away (Away, away)
