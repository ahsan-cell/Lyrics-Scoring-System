**Translated Lyrics:**

When I'm with you, joy is complete  
A true friend, I won't leave you behind  
When I'm with you, I forget my sadness  
A true friend, a bond that lasts till the end  

[Verse 1: All, Joaquin Reyes]  
Even if the times change  
Even if many waves come crashing  
Even if we face defeat again and again  
I’ll be right here  
When you have nowhere to run  
Nowhere to turn to  
We’re right here, we won’t abandon each other  
In the morning, noon, or night, we’re right here  

[Pre-Chorus: Grae Fernandez, Nash Aguas, All]  
Don’t think of the sadness  
Life is just like that  
Whatever happens  
We’ll be right here behind you  
We'll be there together, I won’t leave you  

[Chorus: All]  
When I'm with you, joy is complete  
A true friend, I won't leave you behind  
When I'm with you, I forget my sadness  
A true friend, a bond that lasts till the end  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  

[Verse 2: Nash Aguas, All]  
Even if the storm grows stronger  
Even as the years go by  
Wherever you may go  
I’ll be right here  
I swear and promise to you until the end  
Our friendship will never be forgotten  
Then, now, and forevermore  

[Pre-Chorus: Grae Fernandez, Nash Aguas, All]  
Don’t think of the sadness  
Life is just like that  
Whatever happens  
We’ll be right here behind you  
We'll be there together, I won’t leave you  

[Chorus: All]  
When I'm with you, joy is complete  
A true friend, I won't leave you behind  
When I'm with you, I forget my sadness  
A true friend, a bond that lasts till the end  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  

[Bridge: Grae Fernandez]  
I will never stray away  
This is our promise  

[Chorus: All]  
When I'm with you, joy is complete (Joy is complete)  
A true friend, I won't leave you behind (I won't leave you)  
When I'm with you (When I'm with you)  
I forget my sadness (Forget my sadness)  
A true friend, a bond (Bond) that lasts till the end  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  
(Woah-woah-woah-oh)  

[Outro: Grae Fernandez]  
When I'm with you, joy is complete  
A true friend, a bond that lasts till the end
