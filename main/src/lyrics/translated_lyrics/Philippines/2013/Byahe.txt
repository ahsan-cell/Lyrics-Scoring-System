**Translated Lyrics:**

JRoa!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
No, no, oh-oh, woah, woah  
No, no, no, no, no  

**[Verse 1]**  
Hold my hand (My hand, my hand)  
And I'll take you wherever you want to go  
I’ll be your guide (Your guide, your guide)  
Close your eyes  
And we’ll fly away together  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Let’s escape this world  
No one else, just you and me  
I’m ready to give completely  
My heart is truly only for you  
So hold on tight  

**[Chorus]**  
In my hand, I’m ready to give  
Everything you desire  
For our journey ahead  
Give me your hand  
I won’t let go, no matter where we go  
This trip is just for us  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

**[Verse 2]**  
Hold my hand (My hand)  
I’ll be your armor against all your pain  
I’ll be your guide (Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh)  
Open your eyes  
Don’t hold back your joy  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Let’s escape this world (This world)  
Count on me at all times (Count on me)  
I’m ready to give completely (Completely)  
So tighten your grip (Grip)  

**[Chorus]**  
In my hand, I’m ready to give  
Everything you desire  
For our journey ahead  
Give me your hand  
I won’t let go, no matter where we go  
This trip is just for us

Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh, oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
Just for us, oh, ooh-woah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

**[Bridge]**  
No matter what happens  
I’ll always be right beside you  
Just trust in me  
Don’t let go of your grip
