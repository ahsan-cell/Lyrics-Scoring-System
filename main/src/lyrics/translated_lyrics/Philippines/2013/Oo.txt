**Translated Lyrics:**

You just don’t know, I think of you  
Maybe someday you'll think of me too  
You just don’t know until the night  
I long to see you once more  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Everything ended unexpectedly  
In this time, and now you’ve left me  
In tears, wounded, feeling useless  
I wish you had just asked  

**[Chorus]**  
If only you knew  
I wish you had just asked  
If only you knew  

**[Verse 2]**  
You’ve hurt me so  
Maybe someday you’ll think of that  
You just don’t know how long it’s been  
I’m still here for you  
Even now  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Days have passed filled with joy  
Yet my love remains unchanged  
If I’ve sinned, I hope for your forgiveness  
My weary heart now  
Has no one to love  

**[Chorus]**  
You just don’t know, you’ve hurt me so  
Oh, maybe someday you’ll think, “It’s all about him”  
I wish it were me, you just don’t know, I’m watching you  
I hope you realize you just didn’t know  
You just don’t know  

**[Verse 3]**  
Even if we’re just friends  
Everything comes back when we tease each other  
Maybe someday you’ll think of that  
I’m just here, you just don’t know  
You’re quite clever  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
If you and I are truly defeated  
In this game, should we really give up?  
I wish I had never met you  
If I had known I’d be hurt like this  
I wish I had listened to my mother  

**[Chorus]**  
You just don’t know, you’ve hurt me so  
Oh, maybe someday you’ll think, “It’s all about him”  
I wish it were me, you just don’t know, I’m watching you  
I hope you realize you just didn’t know  

**[Outro]**  
Bad luck for you, you’re the one I chose  
You just don’t know, you’ve hurt me so
