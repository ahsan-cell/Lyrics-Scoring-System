**Translated Lyrics:**

**Magdalena, what’s the problem?  
Why can’t you break free from the chains?  
And every night, you’re in a cell  
That’s your livelihood now.  
Magdalena, what’s the problem?  
We both know you were once a girl,  
And to your father, you were a princess.  
What happened to you?**

**[Post-Chorus: Rico Blanco]  
This is the story of a woman  
Who sleeps in the morning, wakes up at night.  
Her face is full of makeup  
In a place where the lights flicker on and off.  
Let’s begin the story.**

**[Verse 1: Gloc-9]  
I’m her close friend, my name is Ernesto.  
A story you should know, don’t pretend you don’t see.  
Why do we want to know the dirt on others?  
I’ll indulge you, do you know Magda?  
My childhood friend, since we were young.  
We were always together, making paper boats in the stream.  
Her smile lights up the surroundings,  
And when she passes by, heads turn.  
She was stunning when she blossomed into a woman,  
Whenever I talked to her, I’d often be lost in thought.  
Even though I felt something, I tried to shut it down,  
The words and the heartbeat for her.  
And at the dance, after we graduated,  
Because my face was sweaty, I wiped it with powder.  
Even if it wasn’t perfect, I hurriedly pulled her in,  
She introduced me to a guy from Manila.**

**[Chorus: Rico Blanco]  
Magdalena, what’s the problem?  
Why can’t you break free from the chains?  
And every night, you’re in a cell  
That’s your livelihood now.  
Magdalena, what’s the problem?  
We both know you were once a girl,  
And to your father, you were a princess.  
What happened to you?**

**[Verse 2: Gloc-9]  
Many years have passed, I tried to escape,  
But I learned what I truly needed.  
I can’t shift my gaze to anyone else,  
I love her, I will find Magda.  
I traveled while praying to catch up,  
To the place they said she worked.  
I saw her picture stuck on the door,  
Even if her hair was a different color, I couldn’t forget.  
Her eyes and the sweetness of her smile,  
And because she was so joyful, I didn’t hesitate.  
I entered the room, but why was it dark?  
Many tables and drunk people drinking.  
Then suddenly, they applauded, a slow song played,  
On a small stage, I saw her.  
I was puzzled, I asked, scratching my head:  
“Why is she dancing wearing only shoes?”**

**[Post-Chorus: Rico Blanco]  
This is the story of a woman  
Who sleeps in the morning, wakes up at night.  
Her face is full of makeup  
In a place where the lights flicker on and off.  
Let’s continue the story.**

**[Verse 3: Gloc-9]  
She immediately came with me, without hesitation.  
The way she treated me was like a boyfriend, which was strange.  
We got off the taxi near Sta. Mesa,  
It felt like I was the star of the next scenes.  
If this is a dream, I don’t want to wake up,  
But I was dreaming, morning came when I woke up.  
All I found was an envelope on the floor,  
A letter for me that she wrote all night.  
Even though my mind was in chaos, I forced myself to read,  
I won’t forget what she said to me.**

**[Verse 4: Gloc-9 & Jennylyn Mercado]  
My dear Ernesto, I know you’re in deep sleep.  
I didn’t say goodbye, I didn’t wake you.  
Thanks for the treat of sweet rice,  
And for the happiest night of my life.  
When I left our village, I thought  
I would find true love.  
I searched everywhere and with everyone,  
I never imagined this would be my fate.  
Instead of being saved, I was pushed into the abyss.  
This is what it means to cling to a knife’s edge.  
If it stinks, wash it; if it itches, treat it.  
If it’s unbearable, shift your gaze.  
Even if I’m paid and dragged as a woman,  
Who knows the scent of different men’s saliva.  
There’s only one thing I can be proud of to you,  
You are the only one I’ve kissed on the lips
