**Translated Lyrics:**

Just lying in my room  
And lost in thought  
The question to myself  
Where did I go wrong?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Why did I fall for you?  
Like a bubble, you just vanished  

**[Chorus]**  
Why did I choose you?  
Now my heart is suffering  
It’s so simple, yet I’m stuck  
It was with you that I had everything  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
A miracle could turn back time  
What’s wrong can be made right  
In my heart, I’m resigned  
I gave all my life to you  

**[Verse 2]**  
I gave you everything  
Now I deeply regret  
The punishment is too much  
I don’t know if I can take it anymore  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Why did I fall for you?  
Like a bubble, you just vanished  

**[Chorus]**  
Why did I choose you?  
Now my heart is suffering  
It’s so simple, yet I’m stuck  
It was with you that I had everything  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
A miracle could turn back time  
What’s wrong can be made right  
In my heart, I’m resigned  
I gave all my life to you  

**[Bridge]**  
Don’t come near or call me anymore  
Or I might just slap you  
I won’t go back, even if you regret it  
Just leave me be  

**[Chorus]**  
Why did I choose you?  
Now my heart is suffering  
It’s so simple, yet I’m stuck  
It was with you that I had everything  

**[Outro]**  
Why were you the one I picked?  
Now my heart is broken  
My wish is so simple  
To feel the pain and sorrow you do  
I hope for a miracle, to get you back  
That what’s wrong can be made right, I pray  
In my heart, to erase you from my mind
