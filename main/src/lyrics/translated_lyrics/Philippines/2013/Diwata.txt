**Translated Lyrics:**

In your warm embrace, I long for you  
You are the joy that caresses my life  
When I feel down and blue  

Your lips are fragrant, a sweet delight  
When I see you, itâ€™s like gold and silver light  
You are the goddess who walked on this earth  
No one can compare to your worth  

The heavens gaze upon you  
Your beauty is so alluring  
You are my dream come true  

My prayer is to hold you tight  
As time passes by  
Your voice flows like a stream  
Our love will never fade away  
I love you  

Your eyes are  
The color of a gentle tree  
Swaying with the breeze  

The heavens gaze upon you  
Your beauty is so alluring  
You are my dream come true  
My prayer is to hold you tight  
As time passes by  
Your voice flows like a stream  
Our love will never fade away  
I love you
