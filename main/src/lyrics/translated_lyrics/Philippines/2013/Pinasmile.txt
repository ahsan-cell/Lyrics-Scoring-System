**Translated Lyrics:**

Find the way again  
To the land where  
Paradise is the feeling  
This is the day we've been waiting for  
I know that even back then  
Hope was never far away  
Because there's a smile in your heart  

Summer's here in the Philippines, smiles are shining bright  
Summer's here in the Philippines, smiles are shining bright  

**PINASmile** for us  
Like the sun after the rain  
**PINASmile** for us  
Everything feels lighter  
**PINASmile** for us  
Your lips say, "Don't you worry"  
**PINASmile** for us  
There's a song in your laughter  
Whatever comes  

We can do it! We can do it! hey!  
We can do it! We can do it! smile!  

Because of your smile  
The rainbow appeared  
Even if hidden in the dark  
This day won't be missed

Just look into each other's eyes  
There are seven thousand reasons to be happy!
