La-la-la-la-la  
Woah, yeah  
Mm-mm  
Yeah-yeah  
Yeah-yeah  

[Verse 1: James Reid, Nadine Lustre]  
I've been holding this for so long  
Should I say it, will you listen?  
Will I admit the secret I've kept?  
Your love is all I wish for  

[Pre-Chorus: James Reid, Nadine Lustre, Both]  
It's like a test  
Where erasing is not allowed  
One seat apart, no cheating  
Think it through  
Because it's just one question  

[Chorus: Nadine Lustre, James Reid, Both]  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Come on  
I just don’t want to feel out of place  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Yes, let’s go  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  

[Post-Chorus: Both, James Reid, Nadine Lustre]  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  
Ooh-oh  
No, no, no, no, no  

[Verse 2: James Reid, Nadine Lustre]  
Back then, I said "I don't know" while planting seeds  
Now, love has blossomed, just waiting and waiting  
Wasn't it you who shone in the dark?  
Now, I’ll be noticed in your light, it’s different  

[Pre-Chorus: James Reid, Nadine Lustre, Both]  
It's like a test  
Right or wrong  
If you don’t know, don’t guess  
Think it through  
Because it's just one question  

[Chorus: Nadine Lustre, James Reid, Both]  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Come on  
I just don’t want to feel out of place  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Yes, let’s go  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  

[Post-Chorus: Both, James Reid]  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  

[Bridge: James Reid, Nadine Lustre, Both]  
It's like a test  
Complete the blanks, no guessing allowed  
Think it through  
Because it's just one question, oh  

[Chorus: Nadine Lustre, James Reid, Both]  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Come on  
I just don’t want to feel out of place  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Yes, let’s go  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  

[Post-Chorus: Both, James Reid]  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  

[Chorus: Nadine Lustre, James Reid, Both]  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Come on  
I just don’t want to feel out of place  
Are you ready? What now?  
Are you sure? Yes, let’s go  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase  

[Post-Chorus: Both, James Reid]  
No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh

No, no, no, no, no, oh, oh  
No, no, no, no, no, oh  
No turning back, even if it means death  
Period, no erase
