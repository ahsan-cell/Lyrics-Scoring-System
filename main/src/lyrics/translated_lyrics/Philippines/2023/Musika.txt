**Translated Lyrics:**

Only you, my love  
The essence of poetry  
The sound of the guitar  
And the melody of the song  
Even if the voice fades  
It will never disappear  
The mystery you bring  
You are my music  

[Verse 1]  
If the day comes when  
Your eyes can no longer remember  
My face, my love, don’t worry  
The heart remembers  
The image of our love  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If only time could turn back  
I would return to the moment I first saw you  
I would court you again  
To experience loving an angel on earth once more  

[Chorus]  
Only you, my love  
The essence of poetry  
The sound of the guitar  
And the melody of the song  
Even if the voice fades  
It will never disappear  
The mystery you bring  
You are my music  

[Verse 2]  
If my mind can no longer  
Create melodies  
To make your cheeks blush  
Even if my memories fade  
It’s etched in destiny  
Once, I was amazed by you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
If only time could turn back  
I would return to the moment I first saw you  
And I would report to you  
That our story is endless  

[Chorus]  
Only you, my love  
The essence of poetry  
The sound of the guitar  
And the melody of the song  
Even if the voice fades  
It will never disappear  
The mystery you bring  
You are my music  

[Instrumental Break]  
[Chorus]  
Only you, my love  
The essence of poetry  
The sound of the guitar  
And the melody of the song  
Even if the voice fades  
It will never disappear  
The mystery you bring  
You are my music  
I am your music
