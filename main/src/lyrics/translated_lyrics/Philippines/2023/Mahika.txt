**Translated Lyrics:**

The wind surrounding me is stirring  
It feels like there's a hint, I'm longing  
Not forced at all, it just came to be  
The unexpected connection of the universe  

**[Pre-Chorus: Adie]**  
Birds around me, singing sweetly  
I’m mesmerized by your captivating charm  
You make my heart smile  

**[Chorus: Adie]**  
Darling, I can't hold back this rush of feelings  
It seems you’ll make me confess, yours, oh  
Darling, my feelings for you are showing  
I've realized that I like you (I really like you, darling)  

**[Verse 2: Janine Berdin]**  
I don’t know where to begin (To begin)  
Coloring the picture as if  
You’re the only star, the moon beside you  
Behind the clouds, it’s just “us” that will happen  

**[Pre-Chorus: Adie with Janine Berdin]**  
Birds around me, singing sweetly  
I’m mesmerized by your captivating charm  
You make my heart smile  

**[Chorus: Janine Berdin, Both]**  
Darling, I can't hold back this rush of feelings  
It seems you’ll make me confess, yours, oh  
Darling, my feelings for you are showing  
I've realized that I like you  

**[Bridge: Adie, Janine Berdin]**  
I like you, I like you, I like you, I like you  
What kind of magic do you have? (I like you, I like you)  
You’re wrapped in enchantment (I like you, I like you)  
What kind of magic do you have? (I like you, I like you)  
You've captured me already, ah  
(Yes, you've captured me)  
Ah (Yes, you've captured me)  
Ah-ah-ah, whoa-oh, hey  

**[Interlude: Adie, Janine Berdin]**  
You've truly captured me  
Without even trying  
It seems we were meant for each other  
(I’ve truly been captured, without even trying)  
Darling, my feelings are showing  
(Because it seems we were meant for each other)  
Da-da-da-feelings  
Da-da-da-da-da-feelings  

**[Outro: Adie, Both]**  
Darling, darling, darling  
I've realized that I like you
