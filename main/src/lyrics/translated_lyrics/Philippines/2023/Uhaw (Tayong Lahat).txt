**Translated Lyrics:**

Thirsting to kiss you  
To hold you and dance in the rain  
The world feels lighter  
My world feels lighter  
Even if I stray from the path  
I will seek the road  
That leads to you  
You are the way  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if the surroundings darken  
You are still my light  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

[Chorus]  
Why am I thirsty for your dance, why you?  
I won’t let go of you, it’s always you  
I’m feeling cold, come here  
Just stay by my side  
I will remain thirsty, thirsty, thirsty  

[Verse 2]  
I can’t sit still  
My heart is rushing  
To cuddle and cherish you  
Oh, my dear, I’m yours  
Even if I stumble, get tired  
And my knees give way  
I won’t stop  
You are my end  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if my shadow disappears  
You are here, oh, my light  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  

[Chorus]  
Why am I thirsty for your dance, why you? (Why you?)  
I won’t let go of you, it’s always you  
I’m feeling cold, come here  
Just stay by my side  
I will remain thirsty, thirsty, thirsty  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Bridge]  
Thirsty, lost, courting, shouting  
Drowning in every verse of your being  
A mesmerizing poem, every word from your lips  
Thirsty, crying out  

[Chorus]  
Why am I thirsty for your dance, why you?  
I won’t let go of you, it’s always you  
I’m feeling cold, come here  
Just stay by my side  
I will remain thirsty, thirsty, thirsty
