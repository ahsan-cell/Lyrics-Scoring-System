**Translated Lyrics:**

This serenade I sing for the maiden  
With unmatched beauty, her scent like roses in bloom  
If fate, so deceptive, should decide  
It won’t allow us to drift apart  
This letter hoping your eyes will read  
I’m ready to do anything, even court your family  
For the first time, I feel true wonder  
All I wish is that  

**[Chorus]**  
We could be together  
The end and the beginning  
Proving that first love  
Will never fade away  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’ve written countless poems, yet why do you not see?  
My only wish  
Is to be with you until the end  
If only it could last forever  
I’ll never let go, not ever  

**[Chorus]**  
Where has the sweetness of our togetherness gone?  
Where are you? (I keep searching for you)  
Why am I the only one left in this duo? (I hope we meet again)  
Your beautiful voice, will I hear it still?  
Ready to walk alone, even if you’re no longer here  

**[Instrumental Break]**  

**[Outro]**  
Wherever you are, I hope you’re happy now (I’ll set you free, ooh-woah)  
Even if we won’t be together anymore (I still love you)  
Just hear my wish to take care of yourself  
Oh, my beloved Leonora, ahh
