**Translated Lyrics:**

My palms are soaking wet  
The spark is intensely felt  
In my heart, so full of longing  
And a rush of nervousness  
Deep in every breath I take  
I’m just staring at you  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You walked slowly  
Down the aisle to the altar of the church  
I’ll kiss you and never let go  
I have nothing more to wish for  

**[Chorus]**  
You and you  
You and you  
You and you  
You and you  

**[Verse 2]**  
Nothing can compare  
To what I carry every day  
My favorite prayer is  
To grow old with you  
The wish to God who creates  
Is for my last name to be yours  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
You walked slowly  
Down the aisle towards me and held  
Me tight, I couldn’t help  
But shed tears when I embraced you  

**[Chorus]**  
You and you  
You and you  
You and you  
You and you  

**[Interlude]**  
You and you (You and you)  
You and you (You and you)  
You and you (You and you)  
You and you (You and you)  
You and you (You and you)  

**[Outro]**  
(You and you)  
My palms are soaking wet  
The spark is intensely felt  
In my heart, so full of longing  
Nothing can compare  
To what I carry every day  
My favorite prayer is you
