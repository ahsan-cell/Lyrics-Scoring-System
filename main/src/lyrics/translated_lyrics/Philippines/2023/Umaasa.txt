**Translated Lyrics:**

I wandered through the home  
The meeting place, you're not here  
How will the wound heal  
That was made from love? From love?

[Verse 2]  
I thought of you all day  
I read your letters  
How can the tears stop  
That were made from love? From love?

[Chorus]  
The past will return  
The origin will be restored  
Hoping, hoping  
The past will return  
The origin will be restored  
Hoping, hoping

[Verse 3]  
I searched for the old  
Joy and sadness  
I will offer the melody  
That was made from love, from love

[Chorus]  
The past will return  
The origin will be restored  
Hoping, hoping  
The past will return  
The origin will be restored  
Hoping, hoping

[Bridge]  
I wandered through the home  
And our former meeting place  
Hoping, hoping

[Chorus]  
The past will return  
The origin will be restored  
Hoping, hoping  
The past will return  
The origin will be restored  
Hoping, hoping

[Outro]  
The past will return (I wandered through the home)  
(The meeting place, you're not here)  
(Hoping, hoping)  
(I wandered through the home)  
(The meeting place, you're not here)  
(Hoping)
