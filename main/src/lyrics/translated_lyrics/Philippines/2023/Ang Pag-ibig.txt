**Translated Lyrics:**

Just a blink of my eye  
And I’m with you dancing in the dark  
And with just one kiss from you  
My world blooms like flowers, mm-mm  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Oh, an endless puzzle  
And you are the one who created it  

**[Chorus]**  
Only your love is what I truly want  
Only your love is what I truly want, oh-oh  
A lifetime full of color  
Only your love is my desire  

**[Verse 2]**  
And when you hit me  
I can’t bear it anymore, oh, please, don’t be mad  
Oh, you look so wonderful tonight  
And I can't help these tears in my eyes  
You’re always like that  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Oh, an endless puzzle  
And you are the one who created it  

**[Chorus]**  
Only your love is what I truly want  
Only your love is what I truly want, oh-oh  
A lifetime full of color  
Only your love is my desire  

**[Refrain]**  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  

**[Chorus]**  
Only your love is what I truly want  
Only your love is what I truly want  
Oh, a lifetime full of color  
Only your love  

**[Outro]**  
Only your love  
Only your love  
Only your love  
Only your love  
Only your love  
Only your love  
Only your love  
Only your love
