**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Booty, boom, boom, boom  
Men are all about that, yeah, yeah, yeah  
My lips, yum, yum, yum  
Wherever I go, I stand tall, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Here I come, cha-cha-cha  
Let’s jump, jump, jump  
Disco, bang, bang, bang  
Hello, bitches  

[Refrain]  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  

[Verse 1]  
Where am I right now? Shopping spree in Tokyo  
Wake up in my private jet, every morning, tortilla  
Lifting cards in Macau, I’m the best around  
Stop blowing up my phone, just hit me up on Kakao?  
Diamonds in my grill, who’s trying to stop me?  
Skin tone like 22 karat gold I got in Dubai  
My boys won’t hesitate to roll up on your crew  
(My boys won’t hesitate to roll up on your crew)  

[Chorus]  
Booty, boom, boom, boom  
Men are all about that, yeah, yeah, yeah  
My lips, yum, yum, yum  
Wherever I go, I stand tall, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Here I come, cha-cha-cha  
Let’s jump, jump, jump  
Disco, bang, bang, bang  
Hello, bitches  

[Refrain]  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  

[Verse 2]  
Yellow gold shining like a yellow phone?  
You couldn’t see me with a selfie from my phone  
Got hella cash, Hello Kitty getting kinda old  
Want me to love them long time, but I tell 'em no  
Sake to soju, Nagasaki to Seoul  
You can find me in Shanghai, you know what those shots of Baijiu do  
Got these Asian girls dancing on the couches, yeah, they know me  
And they’re singing every word like they were at karaoke, huh  

[Chorus]  
Booty, boom, boom, boom  
Men are all about that, yeah, yeah, yeah  
My lips, yum, yum, yum  
Wherever I go, I stand tall, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Here I come, cha-cha-cha  
Let’s jump, jump, jump  
Disco, bang, bang, bang  
Hello, bitches  

[Refrain]  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  

[Bridge]  
Lights out, killing it some more (na-na-na-na-na)  
Bad bitches get down on the floor (na-na-na-na-na)  
Lights out, killing it some more (na-na-na-na-na)  
Bad bitches get down on the floor (na-na-na-na-na)  
Lights out, killing it some more (na-na-na-na-na)  
Bad bitches get down on the floor (na-na-na-na-na)  
Lights out, killing it some more (na-na-na-na-na)  
Bad bitches get down on the floor (na-na-na-na-na)  

[Interlude]  
One, two, three  
Bitches!  

[Refrain]  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na-na
