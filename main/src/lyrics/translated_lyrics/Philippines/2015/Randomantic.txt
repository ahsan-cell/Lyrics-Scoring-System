**Translated Lyrics:**

Even if it's gone  
Even, even if it's gone  
Even, even if it's gone  
Even, even if it's gone  

[Verse 1]  
What if suddenly  
I wrap my arms around your hips, baby? (Yeah)  
When you least expect it  
I'd kiss you right on your lips, baby (Yeah)  
Write little love notes on a post-it  
And I'll stick it on your front door  
Show up in a suit and tie with a brooch  
And with roses in your front yard, oh-woah  
Doo-doo-roo-roo, roo-doo-doo, yeah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
There are so many ways  
You're the only reason, oh, babe  

[Chorus]  
I'll serenade you wherever we go  
Just something casual (Casual)  
Or maybe suddenly breakfast in bed  
Just to keep you interested  
All of this is just because (Just because)  
I just wanna do simple random things to say, "I love you"  

[Post-Chorus]  
Even if it's gone (Oh-oh)  
Even, even if it's gone (Woah-oh, I love you)  
Even, even if it's gone  
Even, even if it's gone  

[Verse 2]  
I'll try to make you laugh  
Even if you're grumpy (Even if you're grumpy)  
Even if you don't quite resemble  
I'll draw you, ooh-woah, oh-oh-oh  
I'd probably take you to a private little island  
Baby, that's right  
And maybe share a snack that I like  
And baby, I'll give you the last bite, oh-oh  
Doo-doo-roo-roo, roo-doo-doo  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, there are so many ways  
You're the only reason, oh, babe  

[Chorus]  
I'll serenade you wherever we go  
Just something casual (Casual)  
Or maybe an impromptu dinner date  
And this time I won't be late  
All of this is just because (Just because)  
I just wanna do simple random things to say, "I love you"  

[Bridge]  
Random antics, so romantic  
Baby, I'm gonna let you have it, oh  
Doo-doo, roo-doo  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, there are so many ways  
You're the only reason, oh, babe  

[Chorus]  
I'll serenade you wherever we go  
Just something casual (Casual)  
Or maybe treat you to a movie, even if Iâ€™m not into it, sure  
All of this is just because (Just because)  
I just wanna do simple random things to say  
I'll serenade you wherever we go  
Just something casual (Casual)  
Or maybe dedicate this song I wrote for you  
All of this is just because (Just because)  
I just wanna do simple random things to say "I love you"  

[Outro]  
Even if it's gone (Woah-oh)  
Even, even if it's gone (Random ways to say)  
Even, even if it's gone (I love you)  
Even, even if it's gone (Oh, baby)
