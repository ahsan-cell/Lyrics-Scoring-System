**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Keep telling me this and telling me that  
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back  
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach  
I'ma show you that where you're from don’t matter to me  

**[Chorus]**  
She said "Hello, how are you?", she said "こんにちは" (Konnichiwa - Hello in Japanese)  
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Hello, madam"  
Then she said "Sak pase" (How are you? in Haitian Creole) and I said "N'ap boule" (We’re doing well)  
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all  
She said "Hello, how are you?", she said "こんにちは"  
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Hello, madam"  
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"  
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all  

**[Verse 1]**  
African American for sure  
I told her, "Baby come and ride the rodeo"  
Every time I come around man, I go for broke  
She gives me desktop till I overload  
Now baby you gon' go where you're supposed to go  
'Cause I ain't got time for you every day  
She said she got a man, keep it on the low  
I said he don’t speak English, what’s he gonna say (Aye)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Telling me this and telling me that  
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back  
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya  
I'ma show you that where you're from don’t matter to me  

**[Chorus]**  
She said "Hello, how are you?", she said "こんにちは"  
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Hello, madam"  
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"  
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all  
She said "Hello, how are you?", she said "こんにちは"  
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Hello, madam"  
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"  
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all  

**[Verse 2]**  
She’s from Africa but she loves me like she’s Haitian  
Her skin is dark, but her eyes look Asian  
I give her the can in Kansas  
I got it on tape, she’s on Candid Camera  
Okay see, I forgot we met in Oklahoma  
I used to smoke with Regina, she’s from Arizona  
Then I met a girl in Cali, I never disowned her  
She got that high grade, her weed comes with diplomas  
I want her but she keeps  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Telling me this and telling me that  
You said once you take me with you, I’ll never go back  
Now I got a lesson that I want to teach ya  
I'ma show you that where you're from don’t matter to me  

**[Chorus]**

She said "Hello, how are you?", she said "こんにちは"  
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Hello, madam"  
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"  
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all  
She said "Hello, how are you?", she said "こんにちは"  
She said "Pardon my French", I said "Hello, madam"  
Then she said "Sak pase" and I said "N'ap boule"  
No matter where I go, you know I love 'em all
