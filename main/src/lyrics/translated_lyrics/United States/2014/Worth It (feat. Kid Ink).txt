**Translated Lyrics:**

Give it to me, I’m worth it, baby, I’m worth it  
Hmm hmm, I’m worth it, give it, give it, I’m worth it

**[Bridge: Kid Ink]**  
Okay, I told her to bring it back like she left something  
Bring it back, bring it back like she left something  
In the club with the lights down low  
Why are you acting shy? Come show me that you’re in  
The vibe, the vibe, the vibe, the vibe  
Stop playing now that you know I’m in  
The vibe, the vibe, the vibe, the vibe  
Why are you acting shy?  

**[Verse 1: Dinah]**  
Just give yourself to me, just give yourself to me, just give yourself to me, that’s all I want  
And if what they say is true, if it’s true, I could give myself to you  
We can talk about a lot of things, I guarantee I can support you  
I think I can impress you, hurry up, I’m waiting out front  

**[Pre-Chorus: Normani]**  
Hmm hmm, you see me under the spotlight, like: “Oh, I love your style”  
Hmm hmm, show me what you’ve got 'cause I don’t want to waste my time  
Hmm hmm, you see me under the spotlight, like: “Oh, I love your style”  
Hmm hmm, show me what you’ve got now, come show me it’s worth it

Give it to me, I’m worth it, baby, I’m worth it  
Hmm hmm, I’m worth it, give it, give it, I’m worth it  

**[Verse 2: Camila]**  
It all depends on you, it all depends on you, it all depends on you, so what do you want to do?  
And if you have no idea, no idea, I’ll tell you what to do  
Go hard just because, I don’t like, I don’t like it when it’s too sweet  
I like a little roughness, not too much, but maybe just enough  

**[Pre-Chorus: Ally]**  
Hmm hmm, you see me under the spotlight, like: “Oh, I love your style”  
Hmm hmm, show me what you’ve got 'cause I don’t want to waste my time

Hmm hmm, show me what you’ve got now, come show me it’s worth it  

**[Chorus: Camila & Normani]**  
Give it to me, I’m worth it, baby, I’m worth it  
Hmm hmm, I’m worth it, give it, give it, I’m worth it  
Give it to me, I’m worth it, baby, I’m worth it  
Hmm hmm, I’m worth it, give it, give it, I’m worth it
