**[Intro: Young Thug & Offset]**  
Metro Boomin wants some more, nigga! (Hey)

**[Chorus: Offset]**  
Guns, guns in the trunk  
I’m taking out the rookies, taking them out with a shotgun  
A speed-freak bitch, she loves the Patek on my wrist  
We’re aggressive, pussy nigga, turn on your charisma  
Ghostface Killers, Wu-Tang, 21 news gang  
Drug dealers in the Mulsanne, at the top of the food chain  
We’re trading cocaine, outside the gang, a nameless shooter  
Let’s play a game of elimination, we’ll kick down your door as a whole crew  

**[Verse 1: Offset]**  
Wearing a Patek, popped a Xanax, I’m addicted  
Screwed a bad bitch and fell asleep from the amphetamines  
Mirror diamonds, I need shades for them to shine  
Fashionable like Michael Jackson, yeah, I’m a diva  
All this shit is just for bitches, so they can sip it  
Your pockets are empty, you could be my servant  
I roll up to the block, he can’t rent it, so I buy it  
After I broke up with her, I threw her cash for the service  
Wherever I go, my whole crew’s with me  
You can’t hit that bitch because she needs someone more successful  
You think you’re rich just because you have a hundred, or a little more?  
I’m overloaded with money, feels like I sold my soul  
I’m sipping syrup, a liter, I got stripes, Adidas (Stripes)  
I got a foreign girl, I’ve conquered all hardships  
Niggas think they’re invincible until we grab the guns  
Don’t burn in your coupe, this is Italy  
Niggas are desperate, it’s so pathetic  

**[Chorus: Offset]**  
Guns, guns in the trunk  
I’m taking out the rookies, taking them out with a shotgun  
A speed-freak bitch, she loves the Patek on my wrist  
We’re aggressive, pussy nigga, turn on your charisma  
Ghostface Killers, Wu-Tang, 21 news gang  
Drug dealers in the Mulsanne, at the top of the food chain  
We’re trading cocaine, outside the gang, a nameless shooter  
Let’s play a game of elimination, we’ll kick down your door as a whole crew  

**[Verse 2: 21 Savage]**  
Kim Jong-un, big bombs  
Wonderfully rich man, I’ll make your bitch lick the crumbs  
Audemars Piguet all diamond-studded, my wrist is numb  
Took this gun, nigga trying to get high  
Dealer, dealer, I sold cocaine, boy  
All you desperate rappers - food, like you’re a sandwich  
All the same, all these niggas sound alike  
Fox 5 Gang will turn you into a candle in church  
Bitch, I’m a gangster, eating shrimp pasta  
Jamaican crime lord, surrounded by shooters  
Nigga like Mad Max, yeah, I hang with killers  
Planet of the Apes, yeah, I roll with beasts  
I got AKs, SKs, HKs, a wide selection  
You’re a little coward, we don’t joke around  
Office squid, did you finish your work for today?  
You wanna ride with the coroner today?  

**[Chorus: Offset]**  
Guns, guns in the trunk  
I’m taking out the rookies, taking them out with a shotgun  
A speed-freak bitch, she loves the Patek on my wrist  
We’re aggressive, pussy nigga, turn on your charisma  
Ghostface Killers, Wu-Tang, 21 news gang  
Drug dealers in the Mulsanne, at the top of the food chain  
We’re trading cocaine, outside the gang, a nameless shooter  
Let’s play a game of elimination, we’ll kick down your door as a whole crew  

**[Verse 3: Travis Scott]**  
Fell from the sky right into the wild  
Trunk in the front, the roof drops down  
We drive like we’re suicidal, but we stay alive  
When we jump out of brothels - you don’t step outside  
Private status, parking the plane at Magic  
Walking the path of success, you’re crossing my way  
Drank lean and popped MDMA, I need balance  
I see a bloody ass and it’s very realistic  
Watch your fingers because the cactus is dangerous  
Insignificant, you’re not like us, we don’t speak your language  
On the couches  
Tom Cruise, I’ll make her see, she inhales mountains of cocaine  
In our gear, we got rockets
