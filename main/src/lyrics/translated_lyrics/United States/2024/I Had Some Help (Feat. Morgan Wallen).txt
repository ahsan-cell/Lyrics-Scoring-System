**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Post Malone]  
You have a lot of courage, don’t you, darling?  
I just drown my sorrows because you make me do it  
You’re telling all your friends that I’m crazy  
As if I were the only one  
Why would you throw stones at them if you  
Had one or two big wishes?  
Living in this big glass house with a beautiful view  
I thought you knew that  

[Chorus: Post Malone]  
I had help  
It’s not like I could make this mess all on my own  
Don’t act like you didn’t help me pull the bottle off the shelf  
I’ve been pretty involved every weekend, if you didn’t notice  
They say, “Teamwork makes the dream work”  
Of course, I had help (Help)  

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]  
(Help)  

[Verse 2: Morgan Wallen]  
You thought I’d take the blame for us breaking up  
Walking around like you’re not guilty of anything  
You’ve already lost the game you’ve been running from  
Seems like it’s catching up to you, huh  
You think you’re so innocent  
After all the crap you’ve done  
I’m not an angel, you’re not sent from above  
I can’t get us out of this  

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen]  
I had help  
It’s not like I could make this mess all on my own  
Don’t act like you didn’t help me pull the bottle off the shelf  
I’ve been pretty involved every weekend, if you didn’t notice  
They say, “Teamwork makes the dream work”  
Of course, I had help (Help)  

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]  
(Help)  
(Help)  
(Help)  

[Bridge: Morgan Wallen, Post Malone & Both]  
It takes two to break a heart in two, ooh  
Darling, you put the blame on me and, darling, I put the blame on you  
Aw, if that’s not the truth (Oh)  

[Chorus: Post Malone & Morgan Wallen]  
I had help  
It’s not like I could make this mess all on my own  
Don’t act like you didn’t help me pull the bottle off the shelf  
I’ve been pretty involved every weekend, if you didn’t notice  
They say, “Teamwork makes the dream work”  
Of course, I had help (Help)  

[Post-Chorus: Post Malone]  
(Help)  
(Help)  
(Help)
