**[Verse 1: Jung Kook]**  
The weight of the world on your shoulders  
I kiss your waist and ease your mind  
Getting to know you is a chance for me  
I take your hands and trace your lines  

**[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]**  
The way you move  
The way you move  
I think I met you in a different universe  
So break me another time  
You wrap around me, giving me life  
And that’s why night after night  
I’ll love you like this  

**[Chorus: Jung Kook]**  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (A week)  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  
Seven days of the week  
Every hour, every minute, every second  
You know, night after night  
I’ll love you like this  
Seven days of the week  

**[Verse 2: Jung Kook]**  
You love it when I dive right in  
I offer you everything I have  
I show you what commitment means  
Deeper than the ocean  
Let’s rewind and slow it down  
I leave you with that blush  
I’m showing you what commitment means  
Deeper than the ocean  

**[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook]**  
The way you move  
The way you move  
I think I met you in a different universe  
So break me another time  
You wrap around me, giving me life  
And that’s why night after night  
I’ll love you like this  

**[Chorus: Jung Kook, Latto]**  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (A week)  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  
Seven days of the week  
Every hour, every minute, every second  
You know, night after night  
I’ll love you like this  
Seven days of the week  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (A week)  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  
Seven days of the week  
Every hour, every minute, every second  
You know, night after night  
I’ll love you like this  
Seven days of the week (Big Latto)  

**[Verse 3: Latto, Jung Kook]**  
Take control tightly, seize your soul  
Grab your phone and open the gallery  
Leave those clothes at the door  
What are you waiting for? You’d better come and take what you want  
Uh, jumping with both feet  
We won’t sleep until the sun rises  
Seven days a week, seven different sheets  
In seven different positions, I can be your fantasy  
Open up and say “ah”  
Come here baby, I’ll swallow your pride  
How are you? I can adapt to you  
Reach out to me and let me slide  
You make Mondays feel like weekends  
I make sure you don’t think of cheating  
I skip your work, your meetings  
Forget it, let’s just lay down, yeah (Seven days a week)  

**[Chorus: Jung Kook]**  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (A week)  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  
Seven days of the week  
Every hour, every minute, every second  
You know, night after night  
I’ll love you like this  
Seven days of the week  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday (A week)  
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday  
Seven days of the week  
Every hour, every minute, every second  
You know, night after night  
I’ll love you like this  
Seven days of the week
