**Translated Lyrics:**

And then I’ll think of you  
But I can’t tell you  
Because I’m too shy-o-o  

**[Verse 1]**  
You’re too hard to wake up early for  
Like an evening where everything went wrong  
Like a cigarette, you take and burn in the wind  
All that love of mine, you took and hid away  
And if now I wanted to, I can’t love  
You only think of your own interests and it hurts me  
And I know you hate me, what can I do?  
Beyond just giving for nothing and trying again, feeling bad  
Heart like in catalepsy, for a moment  
For you, I’ve written a thousand verses, somewhere  
When you read them again, don’t ask questions  
Because they’re full of nonsense, full of nonsense  

**[Chorus]**  
And then I’ll think of you  
But I can’t tell you  
Because I’m too shy-o-o  
There’s a lack of oxygen  
And I don’t feel free  
And my heart beats strong  
(My heart is a stereo)  

**[Verse 2]**  
Come on, baby, because I have so much to tell you  
I make mistakes and take many risks  
In my dreams, we talk more happily  
But then it’s not like that  
And I’ve solved many things, but not my problems  
And your eyes, if I look at you, you know they’re not real  
Thought so much about going back, like to yesterday  
I just wish you’d leave my thoughts  
Your words are strong like absinthe  
It’s your absence that weighs on me, I don’t give it weight  
And that I want you here forever, it’s implied  
About everything you’ve done to me, I don’t think back  

**[Chorus]**  
And then I’ll think of you  
But I can’t tell you  
Because I’m too shy  
There’s a lack of oxygen  
And I don’t feel free  
And my heart beats strong  
(My heart is a stereo)  

**[Chorus]**  
And I think of you but I don’t know what you do  
What are you looking for from me, you don’t even know  
And you’ll never accept my flaws  
It’s getting late, and now it’s better you go  

**[Chorus]**  
And then I’ll think of you  
But I can’t tell you  
Because I’m too shy-o-o  
There’s a lack of oxygen  
And I don’t feel free  
And my heart beats strong  
(My heart is a stereo)  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
(It’s a stereo)  
Oh-oh-oh-oh  
(My heart is a stereo)
