**[Intro]**  
I told you, "I don't have much patience,"  
We're on important business, I haven't slowed down at all.  
What’s with this hysteria? Your feelings are always changing,  
Don't play with me, I'll burn and just watch.

**[Verse 1]**  
I exploded, couldn't find satisfaction, what a surprise,  
I have a promise to myself, I can't betray.  
Style like a Gulyabani* (a mythical creature), one has attached itself,  
I invited this upon myself, if you don’t call, you won’t find the curse.  
Same horror movie, everyone’s feeling blue,  
I need to stay sober, can’t pop Xanny in the studio.  
It came, in my position, everything's organic, nothing artificial,  
Sometimes a fast, sometimes caviar, sushi.  
Pe-Pennywise drowned the little child inside me,  
To feel excitement, I need to be wild now.  
There’s no trouble I haven’t touched, hitting hard is national,  
Many say, "What if it doesn’t work?" The bottom of the doughnut lake.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
We’ve seen this scene,  
You’ve turned my life upside down.  
If you don’t call, don’t bother, just leave,  
You didn’t drop the drama, everything’s a show.

**[Chorus]**  
Damn, have we become completely false, completely?  
Cursing but couldn’t find happiness,  
You made a ton of demands, I gave in,  
Now that I think about it, our cancer is chronic.

**[Verse 2]**  
When I’m left alone,  
My mouth hides this, though my soul cries out.  
The pain lingers, the fog in my voice is like Kid Cudi,  
Watch this full moon, rise to the sky for one last ritual.  
"I’ll tie you to the bed," I said, it replied, "Wow."  
What happened? There’s more to this, so what?  
Don’t hold back what’s inside, it won’t do your spirit good,  
Then pray for me until morning.  
You thought I was an angel under the spotlight,  
In other realms, my mind’s a tourist.  
Let the guy stay, search for the one he rubbed against, let him come backstage,  
A little storm, these will turn into monkeys, it’s routine for us.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
We’ve seen this scene,  
You’ve turned my life upside down.  
If you don’t call, don’t bother, just leave,  
You didn’t drop the drama, everything’s a show.

**[Chorus]**  
Damn, have we become completely false, completely?  
Cursing but couldn’t find happiness,  
You made a ton of demands, I gave in,  
Now that I think about it, our cancer is chronic.
