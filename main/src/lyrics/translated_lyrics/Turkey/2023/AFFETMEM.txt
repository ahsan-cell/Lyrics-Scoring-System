**[Intro]**  
Hey, Hako  
(A-A-Alo, Waxy?)  
Come sit down and watch (Yeah)  
Let's witness the death of my feelings  
Baby, talk to me (Grr)  
Am I really not that important to you?  
Ah, baby, ah  
You ruined everything (Hey)  
It shouldn't be this easy  
Anyway, I've given up on you too  

**[Verse 1]**  
Come sit down and watch (Yeah)  
Let's witness the death of my feelings (Yeah)  
Baby, talk to me (Hey)  
Am I really not that important to you?  
Ah, baby, ah (Yeah)  
You ruined everything (Hey)  
It shouldn't be this easy  
Anyway, I've given up on you too  
Those who seek will find a way somehow (Yeah)  
You created problems just to leave  
But baby, I won't lie (Grr)  
I wanted you to be my girl so much  
You can't solve these things without time  
You say "Forget it," but you can't  
You play your part well, and they believe you  
You want to come back, but you can't  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
If I forgive you, the nights won't forgive you  
My tears won't forgive, my pride won't forgive you  
While you're out having fun, that boy waiting for you won't forgive  
As I melt away, my friends witnessing this won't forgive  

**[Chorus]**  
If I forgive you (Yeah), the nights won't forgive you  
My tears won't forgive (Grr), my pride won't forgive (Hey)  
While you're out having fun, that boy waiting for you won't forgive (Yeah)  
As I melt away, my friends witnessing this won't forgive (Hey, hey)  

**[Verse 2]**  
I said, "I wish you hadn't done this"  
So my feelings wouldn't be left half-finished (I wish)  
Actually, forgetting was easy (Hey)  
If longing didn't exist at all  
If you and I could go back to the start  
I asked, "Why?"  
Always back to the beginning, but why?  
Ah, ah, but why?  
Ah, ah, but why?  
I asked myself, "Why did you do it?"  
I can't stand the fakeness  
But you're right too  
Why would you get attached to a rogue?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
If I forgive you, the nights won't forgive you  
My tears won't forgive, my pride won't forgive you  
While you're out having fun, that boy waiting for you won't forgive  
As I melt away, my friends witnessing this won't forgive (Yeah)  

**[Chorus]**  
If I forgive you, the nights won't forgive you (Grr)  
My tears won't forgive (Hey), my pride won't forgive (Hey)  
While you're out having fun, that boy waiting for you won't forgive (Yeah)  
As I melt away, my friends witnessing this won't forgive (Hey)  

**[Outro]**  
Yeah, Hako  
(A-A-Alo, Waxy?)
