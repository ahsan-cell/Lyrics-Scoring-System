**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(A-A-Alo Waxy)  
Hey, Hako  
Cano, we’ve given two emotional tracks  
That’s enough, I won’t give you more—

[Chorus]  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed (No)  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed (No)  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  

[Verse 1]  
You think you’ll find someone better than me (There’s no such thing)  
Baby, you’re really foolish (Haha)  
I don’t want you anymore from now on  
I’ve grown cold, honestly, let it be  
You’re no longer my concern (No)  
Just a basic passerby  
Don’t come near, I won’t look at your face  
Let the other fools die and come back (What was your name again, Cano?)  
I wanted you so much, so much, so much  
But you always told me “No” (Exactly)  
I said, “This doesn’t bother me”  
Now come, take a picture with me  
Ba-ba-ba-look, you see; times have changed  
The wheel has turned, spin the gears (Eat, eat)  
Ha-Ha-Hako is now business  
If you want something, you come to my door  

[Chorus]  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed (No)  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed (No)  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  

[Verse 2]  
My baby’s ego can’t be touched (Yeah)  
You’re too dramatic, don’t wear me out (Get lost)  
They say, “Can an ex become next?”  
Cano, nothing good comes from an ex (Honestly, it doesn’t)  

[Bridge]  
Cano, are we broken up now?  
Okay, well, I wrote some things for your new girl  
Something really strange happened (Hahaha), you’ll listen  
Take care of yourself, may God protect you  

[Verse 3]  
(With a pen—) They’ve drawn you with a pen  
All my verses are dedicated to you (All of them)  
Honestly, you’re my muse  
Come to my bed, come, my battery never runs out  
God has taken from me and given to you  
I have no complaints, you did well  
I’m a thief but you’re a princess  
No worries, look, we fit perfectly (We’re ten out of ten)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  

[Chorus]  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed (No)  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  
I won’t bother with you, baby, no  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed (No)  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no  

[Outro]  
I won’t bother with you, baby (Hako)  
I have too much to do, you’re not needed  
Come on, wave goodbye, baby  
Bye-bye baby, you’re not needed, no
