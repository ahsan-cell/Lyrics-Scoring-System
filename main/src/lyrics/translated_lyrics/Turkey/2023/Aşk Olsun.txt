**[Intro]**  
(sayhan, what the heck?)  
(Casap, show me what you’ve got)  
You, o-o-oh (Itadakimasu)  
O-o-oh, o-o-oh (Mhm), o-o-oh  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh love, I didn’t understand  
My heart turned to stone  
No one else could heal me  
Wouldn’t it have been better if you stayed?  
Wouldn’t your place be filled?  
Don’t you ever call or ask about me?  
I’m a wanderer, and you’re so coy  
You leave a person in disarray (Grr-rah!)  

**[Verse 1]**  
While wandering, my mind and thoughts  
I drank until I hit the bottom today (Grr-rah!)  
I couldn’t stay still, I loved every day  
If you hadn’t left, I told you so  
Sometimes we make promises we can’t keep  
Sometimes we see longing in our eyes  
Sometimes we are the biggest ocean in that wave  
Sometimes we watch our ship sink  

**[Bridge]**  
I’m completely drunk when I’m with you  
Villas and palm trees, don’t the seconds ever stop?  
I’m completely drunk when I’m with you  
Villas and palm trees, don’t the seconds ever stop?  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh love, I didn’t understand  
My heart turned to stone  
No one else could heal me  
Wouldn’t it have been better if you stayed?  
Wouldn’t your place be filled?  
Don’t you ever call or ask about me?  
I’m a wanderer, and you’re so coy  
You leave a person in disarray (Grr-rah!)  

**[Verse 2]**  
So that my time doesn’t run out  
So that I have no regrets  
I did everything without thinking  
I learned to run without walking  
In a place far from prying eyes  
You and I, never stopping  
Let’s make love without anyone seeing  
Without burying each other in the ground  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Oh love, I didn’t understand  
My heart turned to stone  
No one else could heal me  
Wouldn’t it have been better if you stayed?  
Wouldn’t your place be filled?  
Don’t you ever call or ask about me?  
I’m a wanderer, and you’re so coy  
You leave a person in disarray (Yeah)  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh love, I didn’t understand  
My heart turned to stone  
No one else could heal me  
Wouldn’t it have been better if you stayed?  
Wouldn’t your place be filled?  
Don’t you ever call or ask about me?  
I’m a wanderer, and you’re so coy  
You leave a person in disarray  
Oh love, I didn’t understand  
My heart turned to stone  
No one else could heal me  
Wouldn’t it have been better if you stayed?  
Wouldn’t your place be filled?  
Don’t you ever call or ask about me?  
I’m a wanderer, and you’re so coy  
You leave a person in disarray
