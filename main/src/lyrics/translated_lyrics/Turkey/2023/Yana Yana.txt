**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Reynmen & Semicenk]  
We loved, burning with passion, sometimes forgotten too many times  
A soul always grieving for those who have gone  
If you can trust my words, please understand me  
If your spirit is broken, then it’s a pity for me  

We loved, burning with passion, sometimes forgotten too many times  
A soul always grieving for those who have gone  
If you can trust my words, please understand me  
If your spirit is broken, then it’s a pity for me, a pity for me  

[Verse: Reynmen & Semicenk]  
One day you'll see every face  
You’ll learn that every word you tasted and every day was wasted  
If you stay in the same place and leave, you’ll be left incomplete  
You’ll laugh at the fate rewritten from where it fell, oh  
Time never gave a break  
All comforts are lies that fade away  
Even if I want to nurture them, they prefer to stay small in my eyes  
Help (Maybe one more chance)  
Come save me (This is all I can give)  
Even if the conditions are tough  
My patience stretches, it could snap at any moment  

[Chorus: Reynmen & Semicenk]  
We loved, burning with passion, sometimes forgotten too many times  
A soul always grieving for those who have gone  
If you can trust my words, please understand me  
If your spirit is broken, then it’s a pity for me  

We loved, burning with passion, sometimes forgotten too many times  
A soul always grieving for those who have gone  
If you can trust my words, please understand me  
If your spirit is broken, then it’s a pity for me, a pity for me
