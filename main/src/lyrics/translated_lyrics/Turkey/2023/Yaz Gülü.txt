**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I found myself beside you  
Even if I don't say a word, you understood  
If only I could pour out my regrets on your path  
My heart races, may it never stop  

[Bridge]  
Doesn't it dance, doesn't it stir?  
I'm left completely bare, love has come  
Hold me by my hands, grasp my waist  
Let my world spin off its axis  

[Chorus]  
Burn me too, in your most beautiful fire  
I’m yours, I’ll come to the worst of it  
I’m willing for your summers and winters, but  
Like a summer rose, so tender and delicate  
Burn me too, in your most beautiful fire  
I’m yours, I’ll come to the worst of it  
I’m willing for your summers and winters, but  
Like a summer rose, so tender and delicate  

[Verse]  
I found myself beside you  
Even if I don't say a word, you understood  
If only I could pour out my regrets on your path  
My heart races, may it never stop  

[Bridge]  
Doesn't it dance, doesn't it stir?  
I'm left completely bare, love has come  
Hold me by my hands, grasp my waist  
Let my world spin off its axis  

[Chorus]  
Burn me too, in your most beautiful fire  
I’m yours, I’ll come to the worst of it  
I’m willing for your summers and winters, but  
Like a summer rose, so tender and delicate  
Burn me too, in your most beautiful fire  
I’m yours, I’ll come to the worst of it  
I’m willing for your summers and winters, but  
Like a summer rose, so tender and delicate
