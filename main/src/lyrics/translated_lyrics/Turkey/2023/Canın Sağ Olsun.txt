**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Rast]  
Take care of yourself  
Take care of yourself, I'll bear the pain  
Fate, take care  
Fate, take care, I will leave  
Take care of yourself  
Take care of yourself, I'll bear the pain  
Fate, take care  
Fate, take care, I will leave  

[Verse 1: Rast]  
Is this how it is? As you walk away  
Did your heart not ache just once?  
This city has no flavor without you  
Take my life, but don’t look at me like that  
I couldn’t escape from you, my death is you  
Everything this life gave, it took back  
How could it be so early? Just when I was about to say "I forgot"  
It turns out there’s still a chance to meet your gaze  

[Chorus: Semicenk]  
Take care of yourself  
Take care of yourself, I'll bear the pain  
Fate, take care  
Fate, take care, I will leave  

[Bridge: Rast]  
A lie, even the memory you left me is a lie  
Alright, then what was it? Tell me what remains?  

[Verse 2: Semicenk]  
My heart bleeds from your touch  
This wound won’t heal just by crying  
If it fills up suddenly, don’t fall from my eyes  
Your suffering was beautiful, loving you  
Not fate, but like an enemy  
Like an unforgivable sin  
Loving you isn’t easy  
I drowned in my tears  

[Chorus: Semicenk]  
Take care of yourself  
Take care of yourself, I'll bear the pain  
Fate, take care  
Fate, take care, I will leave  
Take care of yourself  
Take care of yourself, I'll bear the pain  
Fate, take care  
Fate, take care, I will leave
