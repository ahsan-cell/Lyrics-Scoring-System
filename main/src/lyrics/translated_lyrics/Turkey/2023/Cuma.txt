**[Intro]**  
(Oho-oh, oh-oh)

**[Verse 1]**  
Back then, you used to come to me so casually,  
Time passed without me even realizing.  
"You’re just a friend," you told the kids selling roses,  
I couldn’t laugh that day, went to bed feeling blue.  
My heart belongs to me, but it beats for you,  
I’m clear-headed today, but my eyes are deceiving.  
Is there anyone as stubborn as I am for you?  
We’re two strangers unaware of each other.

**[Chorus]**  
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,  
Whenever I see you, my smile always shines (Grr-rah).  
Wow, don’t believe it, baby, don’t fall for this or that,  
Just hang out with me, the weather’s so nice, hey.

**[Verse 2]**  
Under the stars, on your sunbed,  
You take off your bottom, I’ll show my top (Grr-rah).  
Our song is a summer hit, in our hearts, it’s Müslüm,  
I can’t walk the road straight when I’m feeling down.  
Come on, surrender to my arms,  
Or end up humiliated in someone else’s bed.  
Either be my sunshine in the morning,  
Or get away from here, let my fire ignite.  
I know a lot, I’m exploring everywhere,  
Making her happy with Dom Pérignon,  
With just one call, I get what I want,  
Those in front of me always give up too soon.

**[Chorus]**  
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,  
Whenever I see you, my smile always shines.  
Wow, don’t believe it, baby, don’t fall for this or that,  
Just hang out with me, the weather’s so nice, oh.

**[Verse 3]**  
It’s raining, and I’m under it while getting wet (Eh),  
When asked about you, I say "She’s gone" while getting wet (Eh).  
While all your lies hiss like a snake,  
I caught a glimpse of a sunset while watching on the beach.  
There’s a view, paradise, it feels like heaven (Wow),  
May our love remain unbroken, my beloved.  
Waking up late in the morning, we flow into the night,  
In this treacherous world, we live for our joy.

**[Bridge]**  
My heart belongs to me, but it beats for you,  
I’m clear-headed today, but my eyes are deceiving.  
Is there anyone as stubborn as I am for you?  
We’re two strangers unaware of each other.

**[Chorus]**  
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,  
Whenever I see you, my smile always shines.  
Wow, don’t believe it, baby, don’t fall for this or that,  
Just hang out with me, the weather’s so nice, oh.

**[Outro]**  
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,  
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday,  
Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday, Friday.
