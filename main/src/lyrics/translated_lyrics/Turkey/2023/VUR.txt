**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Alec Benjamin]**  
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?  
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me  
(Casap, show me what you got)  
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely  
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly  
(A-A-Alo Waxy)  

**[Chorus: BLOK3]**  
If you're lying, it doesn't matter (Yeah)  
For some reason, I believe in you (Hey)  
If you're gonna stab me in the back, it's no problem (Hey)  
For some reason, I trust you  
It won't be the first time, come on, hit, hit, hit  
Strike right at my heart, hit, hit, hit  
Hit me again, hit, hit, hit  
Come on, try again, hit, hit, hit  
If you're lying, it doesn't matter  
For some reason, I believe in you  
If you're gonna stab me in the back, it's no problem  
For some reason, I trust you  
It won't be the first time, come on, hit, hit, hit  
Strike right at my heart, hit, hit, hit  
Hit me again, hit, hit, hit  
Come on, try again, hit, hit, hit  

**[Verse 1: BLOK3]**  
I thought we were different  
No lie, I was really fooled  
I don't know how you looked at me  
But I saw you differently  
I had feelings, I didn't know  
I was telling myself about you every night  
I cared so much for someone I hadn't seen  
I expected the same interest from you  
I put you at the center of my life  
But you just hung out with me casually  
Everything was going well like this  
Was it ever worth it? Tell me  
We could have handled it, it wasn't hard  
Your name is no longer "Baby"  
I said, "I have a weakness for music and you"  
But you're no longer my weakness  

**[Bridge: BLOK3 & Alec Benjamin]**  
(If you're lying, it doesn't matter)  
Could you find a way to let me down slowly?  
(For some reason, I believe in you)  
A little sympathy, I hope you can show me  
(If you're gonna stab me in the back, it's no problem)  
(For some reason, I trust you)  
If you wanna go, then I'll be so lonely  
(It won't be the first time)  
(Strike right at my heart)  
(Hit me again)  
If you're leaving, baby let me down slowly  
(Come on, try again)  

**[Chorus: BLOK3]**  
If you're lying, it doesn't matter  
For some reason, I believe in you  
If you're gonna stab me in the back, it's no problem  
For some reason, I trust you  
It won't be the first time, come on, hit, hit, hit  
Strike right at my heart, hit, hit, hit  
Hit me again, hit, hit, hit  
Come on, try again, hit, hit, hit  
If you're lying, it doesn't matter  
For some reason, I believe in you

Strike right at my heart, hit, hit, hit  
Hit me again, hit, hit, hit  
Come on, try again, hit, hit, hit  

**[Verse 2: BLOK3]**  
I told you clearly, "Come be mine"  
You're so fast, I struggled to keep up  
Normally, I would just hang out, but  
I never felt this way with you  
Then everything turned out to be a lie  
I really fell apart, became a wreck  
I said, "Whatâ€™s happening to you, Hakan?"  
Choosing a tattoo for a girlfriend or something  
My body shows a tendency to crime  
My heart always fights with my brain  
I hope you're not regretting it  
I'm not someone who forgives people  
Everyone can listen to this song  
But only you can understand it  
I no longer trust anyone  
You can be proud of yourself  

**[Chorus: BLOK3]**  
If you're lying, it doesn't matter  
For some reason, I believe in you  
If you're gonna stab me in the back, it's no problem  
For some reason, I trust you  
It won't be the first time, come on, hit, hit, hit  
Strike right at my heart, hit, hit, hit  
Hit me again, hit, hit, hit  
Come on, try again, hit, hit, hit  
If you're lying, it doesn't
