**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
My heart has become a poster all over the neighborhood,  
What’s done is done, those who left are happy where they are.  
I’ve been struck, but I swear it doesn’t matter,  
This love was of no use to him anyway.  
I met a woman in love with her executioner,  
A little drunk, I understood from her tears.

**[Chorus]**  
Have no mercy on the perpetrator, he’ll pull the trigger again,  
A love stained with blood is worse than separation.  
Patrols wander through the back streets of your heart,  
A lovesick fool will wake you from your sleep.  
Have no mercy on the perpetrator, he’ll pull the trigger again,  
A love stained with blood is worse than separation.  
Patrols wander through the back streets of your heart,  
A lovesick fool will wake you from your sleep.

**[Verse 2]**  
My heart has become a poster all over the neighborhood,  
What’s done is done, those who left are happy where they are.  
I’ve been struck, but I swear it doesn’t matter,  
This love was of no use to him anyway.  
I met a woman in love with her executioner,  
A little drunk, I understood from her tears.  

**[Chorus]**  
Have no mercy on the perpetrator, he’ll pull the trigger again,  
A love stained with blood is worse than separation.  
Patrols wander through the back streets of your heart,  
A lovesick fool will wake you from your sleep.  
Have no mercy on the perpetrator, he’ll pull the trigger again,  
A love stained with blood is worse than separation.  
Patrols wander through the back streets of your heart,  
A lovesick fool will wake you from your sleep.
