**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Semicenk & Doğu Swag]  
I have no regrets about being yours (About being yours)  
I have no regrets about you breaking me (About you breaking me)  
Not for a moment did I tire of fighting (Of taking one more step)  
Always thinking you would leave (I can't escape from loneliness)  
I have no regrets about being yours (About being yours)  
I have no regrets about you breaking me (About you breaking me)  
Not for a moment did I tire of fighting (Of taking one more step)  
Always thinking you would leave (I can't escape from loneliness)  

[Verse 1: Semicenk]  
Everything was a lie, only one life left to give you  
A sinner without repentance, a place that can't be filled  
I don't think you would throw me away, step by step I remembered  
Only you existed, leaving me condemned to myself  

[Verse 2: Doğu Swag]  
Like a candle, it will extinguish in the wind  
I buried my hopes, did you see?  
It will fall down quite tired  
Freedom with broken wings  
Like a bird chasing after you  
There are many more words, but like a soul  
Your existence is absent, my dear  
Surrounded by troubles on all sides, but  

[Chorus: Semicenk & Doğu Swag]  
I have no regrets about being yours (About being yours)  
I have no regrets about you breaking me (About you breaking me)  
Not for a moment did I tire of fighting (Of taking one more step)  
Always thinking you would leave (I can't escape from loneliness)  
I have no regrets about being yours (About being yours)  
I have no regrets about you breaking me (About you breaking me)  
Not for a moment did I tire of fighting (Of taking one more step)  
Always thinking you would leave (I can't escape from loneliness)
