**[Part I]**

**[Intro]**  
(Give it to me, AKDO!)  
(Hrr)  
(Wow)  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’m stepping out to the neighborhood, in my pajamas  
A fool saw me, reached for his gun  
So I painted that fool’s face black  
My Louis Vuitton pajamas slipped a bit from my behind  
Of course you’re broke, man, living on rent (Grr)  
You fell into trouble right when I was going crazy (Yeah)  
My friends are with me, we’ve got cigarettes in hand  
They’ll cut you up for just two bottles of beer (Rrrah)  
Hit and spin, man, let the world turn  
Let the fools die, let them bury each other (Yeah)  
We’ll talk the talk, let the one who eats it divide  
Shut your phone, man, you’re still a fool, ah  
Live your life, son, leave the empty words behind (Grr)  
Take a tour from Istanbul Anatolia to Europe (Rrrah)  
I’m opening the pipes, Azer Baba, Serap (Shşş)  
All the bitches are far away from us  
My head, oh, believe me, it’s not right  
While the gazelle drinks water, the lion hunts (Ah)  
I mean, wow, there’s no justice left  
Everyone understands, everyone understands (Got it)  

**[Part II]**

**[Intro]**  
Ah  
That notebook of yours is closed and gone (Give it to me, AKDO!)  
(Hrr)  

**[Verse 2]**  
Ah, that notebook of yours is closed and gone  
Everyone’s got a sword, the radio’s playing mehter (Woah)  
I’m coming to the center of the neighborhood in a Benz  
You’ve got a tissue on your nose, catching a cold from the ****  
Clean up all the crap you’ve eaten  
A shark will find the scent in the sea  
Anyway, I reached for the door latch  
At that moment, the bird flew away, landed on a branch (Yeah)  
I pulled out the nine from my waist into the air  
I said, “I’ll put it where the one who talks to me belongs” (Exactly)  
I’ll take money from my brother if he’s stingy  
Then say, “Why did I get in between?” (Exactly)  
Be careful and don’t crash into the rock (Rock)  
Everyone has their own share  
I put the arrow on my bow (Hahaha), and my album is on air (Listen)  
Lvbel C5, man, all my friends are by my side  
Forget it, baby, come, you can have some too  
Touch my body, solid, this tank is metal, ah  
Bright green Balenciaga, like a hunt  
For me, Lvbel C5, man, is very polite, wow  
The flower shoots flames, your ships will sink  
The rose throws thorns, the whore will sell you  
He loses his mind and does what’s needed  
In the mornings, he sleeps, the wolf takes the lamb,  

**[Outro]**  
(Give—, give—)  
(Give—, give—)  
(And-and-and give it to me, AK-AK-DO!)
