**Translated Lyrics:**

I thought I would love you with all my heart  
But what I've kept inside is wearing down my patience  
I mourn for the life that will slip away  
Help me, God, I've been so deeply hurt  

[Verse]  
A dream, a breath, this world feels empty  
But when separation comes, it ignites your collar  
Tell me, which words can heal my wounds?  
It's too late now, understand me  
I can never pull back  
Regret brings no benefit  
I walk my own path  
My heart has grown used to the drought  
Even if you say I'm close, the world remains far  
The hour hand and minute hand, time  
These thoughts linger about my beloved  
The traces of the past, retreat now  
Who knows my state?  
I threw myself into the fire, crossed my line  
I've passed through the cold season, oh  

**[Chorus]**  
I thought I would love you with all my heart  
But what I've kept inside is wearing down my patience  
I mourn for the life that will slip away  
Help me, God, I've been so deeply hurt  
I thought I would love you with all my heart  
But what I've kept inside is wearing down my patience  
I mourn for the life that will slip away  
Help me, God, I've been so deeply hurt
