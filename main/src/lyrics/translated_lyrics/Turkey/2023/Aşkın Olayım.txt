**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
A person is born alone,  
But they don’t die alone, how about that?  
Let sorrow stay far from us,  
No need for you to ask.  
I’ve been burned, it’s hard to describe,  
I could say it a thousand times a day.

[Pre-Chorus]  
When your face smiles, the sun rises,  
I squint my eyes, and roses bloom all at once.  
This is how a lifetime with you feels,  
Our hands filled with roses and sunshine.

[Chorus]  
Never were dreams worthy of you spoken before me,  
My heart is captive, you know it too, subtly.  
This place is always a battlefield thanks to you, no complaints,  
Come, let me embrace you, let me be your love.
