**[Intro]**  
(Where are you, Pango?)

**[Verse 1: Heijan]**  
I broke free from those troubled streets (Those streets), oh  
Many of my friends in illicit trades (Illicit trades)  
Weekly at the police stations giving statements (Statements), oh  
Back then, I was dealing with disaster (Disaster)  
Many older brothers, entrusted with the town (Entrusted), oh  
Still roaming around, believe me, in the homeland (In the homeland)  
I saw a ton of murders happening, oh  
Never spoke about loyalty (Loyalty)  
Not art, what you wrote is illegal (Illegal), oh  
There was no sparkle of life in your neighborhood (Sparkle)  
"How did you get acquitted?" they ask, oh  
Curious about my testimony in court (Curious)

**[Bridge 1: Heijan]**  
I grew up in that neighborhood, pure and clean, just like that  
You can criticize the slums, you keep hanging out, just like that  
I saw many gentlemen, what do they do in my neighborhood?  
They had a ton of people killed for money, just like that  
A tie is more dangerous than a weapon today, just like that  
The pen they hold has the skill of a bullet, just like that  
They all seem like whores to my neighborhood, wow!  
They devoured those people, just like that (Just like that, just like that), oh

**[Chorus: Heijan]**  
We are bad, just like that  
We are bad, just like that (We are bad, just like that), oh  
We are bad, just like that (Just like that), oh  
We are bad, just like that

**[Verse 2: Muti]**  
Broken system, broken mind in a shanty (Shanty), oh  
Dirty deals, I owned a bloody Rolex (Owned it)  
One day the trigger will fall, it’ll be history (History)  
It’s not money, but poverty that breaks you, son (Breaks you, son)  
The news will mention an unknown perpetrator, oh  
They'll eat you up in a street, like cashew, uh  
My tongue turns, the pen writes, just like that, my man  
Those you call "brother" were always sheep (Always sheep)  
Not art, my life is illegal (Illegal)  
There was no sparkle of life in my eyes (Sparkle)  
The rustle of money sounded sweet to you (Rustle)  
One day, justice's hibernation will end (Hibernation)

**[Bridge 2: Muti]**  
Life is yours, the city is yours, the money is yours, just like that  
Unseen in the homeland, just like you, just like that  
You’re the brother, you’re the king, you’re the pasha, just like that  
One day the wheel will turn, I’ll see you just like that (Just like that, just like that)

**[Chorus: Muti]**  
We are bad, just like that  
We are bad, just like that  
We are bad, just like that (We are bad, just like that)  
We are bad, just like that (We are bad, just like that)

**[Outro]**  
(Impact on the track)
