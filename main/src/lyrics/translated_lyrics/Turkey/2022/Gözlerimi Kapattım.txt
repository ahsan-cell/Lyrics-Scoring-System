**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
I closed my eyes, letting my dreams go until darkness falls  
The day love fell onto the roads, I shut my eyes  
Now I'm not sure of anything, I've remained a child  
I would tell you so much, but you wouldn't hold it in your mind  

[Verse 1]  
If one day your head falls into trouble  
Don't remember it like you forgot  
If it wounds, it will keep bleeding from the scars you opened  
My scars are from my childhood  
How alone I am, left all by myself  
How I miss you, tears have fallen in my hair  

[Chorus]  
I closed my eyes, letting my dreams go until darkness falls  
The day love fell onto the roads, I shut my eyes  
Now I'm not sure of anything, I've remained a child  
I would tell you so much, but you wouldn't hold it in your mind  

[Verse 2]  
If one day summer turns back into winter  
If one day you hear my name mixed up in a crime  
Know that my hopes have run out  
All the beauty left in me has been tainted by the bad  
All my loved ones have left one by one  
I understood, as I grew older, it would all end  
Years today feel like a stranger to you  
For those who want to leave, just one wheel is enough
