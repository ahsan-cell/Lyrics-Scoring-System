**[Intro]**  
Lvbel C5, baby, Arem, Arman  

**[Verse 1]**  
Get yourself together a little more  
Lvbel C5, baby, full throttle on the curve  
Sometimes in the neighborhood, sometimes at the beach  
My mind's been blown, guns are talking  
Lamborghini, bright green, with Tatanga inside  
Your battery's low, mine's fully charged  
The neighborhood's a bit chaotic, some throw themselves in  
Some can't sail to the ocean, sinking in the sand  
Shake the dice in your hand  
But I already knew the uncle long ago  
I hooked the big fish with my bait  
I recognize that hook speaking from your eyes  
Tell your tale, we love it anyway  
I'm walking with the crowd behind me  
Smelling the rose, but it's already dried  
Search for it, look, you'll get your answer, just like that  
Seats are full, gas pedal in the car  
I cast my line, caught a like, just like a mullet  
What seems bad to you adds color to me, baby  
I watch, the world is outpacing Lvbel C5  
My words are a disaster, it's literally a mess  
Baby, I won't take a photo with you  
If the rooster crows, its voice will be cut off  
We filled the highway, this Toros is on fire  

**[Chorus]**  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
You've stuck to my collar  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
You've stuck to my collar  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
You've stuck to my collar  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me, yeah  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
You've stuck to my collar  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me  

**[Verse 2]**  
Yeah, I loved you, darling, without seeing  
34, Istanbul, I escaped the area  
Sweating instantly before even seeing her  
The light burst, still not gone out  
Chivas, Coca-Cola, pump it up, pump it up  
Suit boss, five-star room  
My heart's still with her, with her  
Keep going, baby, donâ€™t fall behind  

**[Chorus]**  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
You've stuck to my collar  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me, yeah  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
You've stuck to my collar  
La-la-la, baby, la-la-la  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me  

**[Outro]**  
Da-da-don't crowd me  
Da-da-da-da-don't crowd me  
Da-da-don't crowd me  
Chivas, Coca-Cola, pump it up, pump it up  
Da-da-don't crowd me  
Da-da-da-da-don't crowd me  
Da-da-don't crowd me  
Don't crowd me, don't crowd me
