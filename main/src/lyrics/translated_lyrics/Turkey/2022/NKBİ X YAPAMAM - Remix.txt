**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Lvbel C5]**  
Our battle; your hair, look, it suits my shoulder so well  
Baby, believe me, my mind is so tangled, so tangled  
Two wrists AP, what would I be if I didn’t love you?  
I kissed your lips and touched the sky  
(La, la, la, la la la, la, la, la, la la la)  

**[Verse 1: Güneş]**  
Wake up, get up, you have a path to take  
The smoke won’t disperse  
Don’t blow it in, just breathe it in, burn  
“That voice inside me says, ‘You still have a way to go,’” even in my head  
It never calms down, never tires while I struggle stubbornly, stubbornly  

**[Chorus: Güneş & Lvbel C5]**  
What is it that you want from me?  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
My soul suffers, trapped in this body  
You never asked me what I wanted  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
If you want to remember me, look at the stars  
Your words are always traps, I must not fall  
I must not fall, I must not fall  
What is it that you want from me?  

**[Verse 2: Güneş & Lvbel C5]**  
Everything on my mind came through my nose  
It took a long time to escape (Ah)  
I never went anywhere  
We have nothing left in our hands  
You know, I never look back  
As the days pass, they’re always monotonous  
Nights blend into days  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(We have nothing left in our hands)  
Tell me (We have nothing left in our hands)  

**[Chorus: Güneş & Lvbel C5]**  
What is it that you want from me?  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
My soul suffers, trapped in this body  
You never asked me what I wanted  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
If you want to remember me, look at the stars  
Your words are always traps, I must not fall  
I must not fall, I must not fall  
What is it that you want from me?  

**[Bridge: Güneş & Lvbel C5]**  
What is it that you want from me?  
We have nothing left in our hands  
So what do you want?  
We have nothing left in our hands  
You didn’t ask me what I desire (Uuh)  
We have nothing left in our hands  
You didn’t ask me what I wanted  

**[Chorus: Güneş & Lvbel C5]**  
What is it that you want from me?  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
My soul suffers, trapped in this body  
You never asked me what I wanted  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
If you want to remember me, look at the stars  
Your words are always traps, I must not fall  
I must not fall, I must not fall  
What is it that you want from me?  

**[Outro: Güneş & Lvbel C5]**  
Ha, ha, ha-a?  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
My soul suffers, trapped in this body  
What you want  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
My soul suffers, trapped in this body  
What do you want? What do you want?  
I can’t do it, I can’t do it  
My soul suffers, trapped in this body  
What you want from me  
La, la, la, la
