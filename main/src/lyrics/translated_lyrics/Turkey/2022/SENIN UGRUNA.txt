**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(E-Edokaleen)

[Chorus: UZI]  
Please step back, I’m really fed up  
I felt like I was in a cage  
In the end, I broke free  
I woke up and I was so alone  
I teamed up with the treacherous devil  
Don’t think I wore the watch because of him  
I got out of this swamp early

[Background Chorus: UZI]  
Woah, for your sake  
Baby, believe me  
Woah, on the path to victory  
I walked, I won’t stop, never

[Verse: Mavi]  
I explained it clearly  
Girl, look, there’s only one of me  
I can’t decorate you with tulips  
If you knew what I’m fighting against  
You adorned everything with excuses  
I didn’t stay silent, everything I have is still real  
You want to know “Where’s the party?”  
I’m exhausting my body beyond limits

[Bridge: Mavi]  
I still see you’re not doing anything  
My lost mind, everything’s an illusion  
My secrets are hidden in you  
The back alleys of my mind are never safe  
Look, my identity has changed for your sake

[Chorus: Mavi & UZI]  
Woah, please  
Please step back, I’m really fed up  
I felt like I was in a cage  
In the end, I broke free  
I woke up and I was so alone  
I teamed up with the treacherous devil  
Don’t think I wore the watch because of him  
I got out of this swamp early

[Background Chorus: UZI]  
Woah, for your sake  
Baby, believe me  
Woah, on the path to victory  
I walked, I won’t stop, never
