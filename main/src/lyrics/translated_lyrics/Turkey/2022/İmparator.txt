**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Heijan]**  
(Kachi)  
(H-H-H-H-Hypzex)  
We’ve lived bravely, we always stand tall  
No one can speak to our faces, you know  
One neighborhood equals all of Istanbul  
If needed, we’ll fight, of course, you know  

**[Verse 1: Heijan]**  
Our minds are always spinning like macarons  
If one of us is on stage, the other’s at the station  
Neighborhood gang, full, money flows illegally  
Drop that trigger and you’ll become an emperor  

**[Chorus: Heijan]**  
But if you dare, if you step into that street  
If you have the courage, come see who eats whom  
Of course, if you dare, if you step into that street  
If you have the courage, come see who eats whom  

**[Verse 2: Muti]**  
(Shh-shh)  
We’ve lived through pain, our nature is tough  
No one can recognize my face, you know (you know)  
Just the two of us, equal to the whole market  
I swear we’ll take them all down, you know (we will, you know)  
One night, two bikes, glocks on us, wow  
We’ll bring that scene to life, starting a marathon  
Hearts are steel, of course, no vests on us  
If you want to drop us, the whole city’s a shooting range  

**[Chorus: Muti]**  
Of course, if you dare, if you step into that street  
If you have the courage, come see who eats whom  
But if you dare, if you step into that street  
If you have the courage, come see who eats whom (who eats whom)  

**[Outro: Muti & Heijan]**  
(Impact on the track)  
We’ve lived through pain, our nature is tough  
No one can speak to our faces, you know  
Just the two of us, equal to the whole market  
If needed, we’ll fight, of course, you know (of course, you know, of course, you know)
