**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  

[Verse 1]  
The color of resistance in this life is green,  
Your acceptance of me is full of holes.  
How many times has my heart conquered this?  
Sometimes it shares its troubles, half reconciled.  
Its value shown in absence, a silent display,  
Many complaints that tie you to me.  
Each voice calls out to me differently,  
But I miss the only voice I know every day.  

[Bridge]  
So wise, so wise, so wise,  
In the end, it was he who lost.  
What was right turned wrong, he lay in his bed,  
And made this a burden too.  
So wise, so wise, so wise,  
In the end, it was he who lost.  
What was right turned wrong, he lay in his bed,  
And made this a burden too.  

[Chorus]  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  

[Verse 2]  
Tie my hands, I won't stay behind,  
Expensive brands that make me feel good.  
In the future, I’ll branch out in different ways,  
I’ll hold onto life, to the elders.  
Different cakes blown out each year,  
The same age as those who don’t grant my wish.  
My fire that doesn’t burn won’t die for you,  
Tribal patients whose degrees never drop.  
I died in the morning, died, died, died, then revived again,  
The night turns again, turns, turns, turns; this time I extinguished it.  
While I thought my lungs were fresh, I wasted them in the ashtray,  
When I called my flower "Past," my tongue trembled many times, many times.  

[Chorus]  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.  
From land to land, wandering freely,  
Months and years have passed on these roads.
