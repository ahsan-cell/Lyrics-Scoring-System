**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
I've been running for years, they're chasing me  
Here comes the farewell hour, am I ready? Not yet (Yeah)  
It's been weighing on me for nights now  
The farewell hour has come, am I ready? Not yet  

[Verse]  
Yeah, I won't say goodbye  
Stay by my side, just one more time  
Iâ€™d give my life for it, I can't measure this in worth (Worth, worth)  
Place your hands on my head just one more time, go ahead  
Rise like the sun over the days without you, shine, shine  
Even if they offered me the world, it wouldn't matter anymore  
I want you by my side, there's no specific reason for this (No, no)  
I've found my way, and you know I can't turn back from what I know  
Time is flowing now, even if I don't want it, I'm growing  

[Chorus]  
I've been running for years, they're chasing me  
Here comes the farewell hour, am I ready? Not yet  
It's been weighing on me for nights now  
The farewell hour has come, am I ready? Not yet  
I've been running for years, they're chasing me  
Here comes the farewell hour, am I ready? Not yet  
It's been weighing on me for nights now  
The farewell hour has come, am I ready? Not yet
