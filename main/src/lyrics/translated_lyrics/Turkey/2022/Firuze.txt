**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
One day, looking back at dreams  
If you’ve sipped your years, sip by sip  
Cry, cry, Firuze, cry  
Tell how once you were of unbearable beauty  

[Verse 1]  
Spring greens envy your color  
You’re like a spell of love, Firuze  
You’re a delicate flower, a forest nook  
You’re like the mist of grapes, Firuze  

[Chorus]  
Like a clear water stream, sometimes like a volcano  
Sometimes like a wild wind  
In your eyes, there’s a rush, to you, the years feel slow  
What’s your hurry? Wait, Firuze  

[Instrumental]  

[Verse 2]  
If a painful gaze settles in  
From the tip of your lashes to your pupil  
Everything has its price, even your beauty  
One day it will be paid, pay up, Firuze  

[Chorus]  
Like a clear water stream, sometimes like a volcano  
Sometimes like a wild wind  
In your eyes, there’s a rush, to you, the years feel slow  
What’s your hurry? Wait, Firuze
