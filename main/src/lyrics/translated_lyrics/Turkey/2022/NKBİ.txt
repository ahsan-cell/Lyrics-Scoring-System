**[Intro]**  
I wasn't, I went crazy, never could be good  
I'm not yours, don't say what's good for me  
It's not that deep, I can fit, but I'm deep inside  
They can't see what's within, they just look at the outside, is it good?  
I fought, better to take a hit than to run away  
Don't walk with me, dirt will gather on your feet  
It will gather, it will gather, it will gather  

**[Verse 1]**  
Wake up, get up, you have a path  
The smoke won't disperse  
Don't blow it in, burn  
"There's still some way to go," says that voice inside me, even in my head  
It never calms down, never tires while I struggle stubbornly, stubbornly  

**[Chorus]**  
What do you want from me? (From me)  
You didn't ask me what I want (What I want)  
Your words should never be a trap  
I mustn't fall, I mustn't fall  
What do you want from me?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Everything in my mind came through my nose  
Running away took quite a while (Ah)  
I never went anywhere  
Isn't there a place for you? Again, not by my side  
For you, it's best to stay half here  
Don't search far, I'm always on this side  
I was left alone, meaningless without you by my side  
I deceived tomorrow, forget the night  
When the day is near, turn back my contradiction, tell me  
Tell me  

**[Chorus]**  
What do you want from me? (From me)  
You didn't ask me what I want (What I want)  
Your words should never be a trap  
I mustn't fall, I mustn't fall  
What do you want from me?  

**[Bridge]**  
What do you want from me?  
What do you want?  
You didn't ask me what I want (Uuh)  
You didn't ask me what I want  

**[Chorus]**  
What do you want from me?  
You didn't ask me what I want  
Your words should never be a trap  
I mustn't fall, I mustn't fall  
What do you want from me?  

**[Outro]**  
Ha, ha, ha-a?  
What you want  
What do you want? What do you want?  
What you want from me
