**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
I couldn't return shamelessly,  
Unconcerned about my escape.  
Maybe I couldn't stay in your mind,  
Pretending to love you.  
I couldn't return shamelessly,  
Unconcerned about my escape.  
Maybe I couldn't stay in your mind,  
Pretending to love you.  

[Verse 1]  
Some were there, but they weren't so innocent (Ooh)  
The harm tightened when it reached the heart (Ooh)  
Tears filled the eyes, falling from them back to hearts,  
Leaning the burden of your life on my shoulder was no trouble at all.  

[Chorus]  
I couldn't return shamelessly,  
Unconcerned about my escape.  
Maybe I couldn't stay in your mind,  
Pretending to love you.  
I couldn't return shamelessly,  
Unconcerned about my escape.  
Maybe I couldn't stay in your mind,  
Pretending to love you.  

[Verse 2]  
Hope lies behind the one who has gone,  
My sigh rests and rises with you.  
There are many words to say to you,  
But there was no strength when you looked at their meaning.  
While my soul remained shattered,  
It's hard, it has no meaning, it has no meaning.  

[Chorus]  
I couldn't return shamelessly,  
Unconcerned about my escape.  
Maybe I couldn't stay in your mind,  
Pretending to love you.  
I couldn't return shamelessly,  
Unconcerned about my escape.  
Maybe I couldn't stay in your mind,  
Pretending to love you.
