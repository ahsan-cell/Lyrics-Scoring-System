**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
I heard you've grown tired of my embrace so soon,  
Searching for a thousand ways, a thousand paths to return.  
I heard you've grown tired of my embrace so soon,  
Searching for a thousand ways, a thousand paths to return.  
Come, see that the wind here has blown from the harshest north,  
Freshly blossomed, yet spring's chill has cut me short.  
Come, see that the wind here has blown from the harshest north,  
Freshly blossomed, yet spring's chill has cut me short.  

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t want it anymore, don’t turn back,  
Even if you do, don’t extinguish in this home.  
I don’t want it anymore, don’t turn back,  
Even if you do, don’t extinguish in this home.  

**[Verse 2]**  
It resembles ice-cold water,  
Believe me, every love is finished.  
If you press on your wound like salt,  
There’s no remedy for you.  
How delicate, how treacherous,  
Neither loyal nor cruel,  
It’s a longing, it’s a revenge,  
What’s left after betrayal.  
It’s a longing, it’s a revenge,  
What’s left after betrayal.  

**[Chorus]**  
I don’t want it anymore, don’t turn back,  
Even if you do, don’t extinguish in this home.  
I don’t want it anymore, don’t turn back,  
Even if you do, don’t extinguish in this home.
