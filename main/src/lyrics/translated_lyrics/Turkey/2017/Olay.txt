**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Don’t ask me if I’m alive  
It can’t be written on a wall or paper  
Touching, it touches the hard way  
You don’t embrace the wise with the mad, right?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if you were made of fire  
I would strip down and dress again  
Even if you were a poisoned arrow  
I would bow down and lay myself before you  

[Chorus]  
Actually, with the first-first-firsts  
If only love could keep you alive  
The rest is easy anyway  
Actually, with the first-first-firsts  
If only love could keep you alive  
The return is bound to happen anyway  
Actually—  

[Verse]  
Don’t ask me if I’m alive  
It can’t be written on a wall or paper  
Touching, it touches the hard way  
You don’t embrace the wise with the mad, right?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if you were made of fire  
I would strip down and dress again  
Even if you were a poisoned arrow  
I would bow down and lay myself before you  

[Chorus]  
Actually, with the first-first-firsts  
If only love could keep you alive  
The rest is easy anyway  
Actually, with the first-first-firsts  
If only love could keep you alive  
The return is bound to happen anyway  
Actually— (x3)
