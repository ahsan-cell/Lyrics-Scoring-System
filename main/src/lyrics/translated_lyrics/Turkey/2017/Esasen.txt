**Translated Lyrics:**

It's already completely severed  
If you want, leave me to time  
I’ve grown up with you, essentially...

Are you telling me to leave today and look to tomorrow?  
And I, you know, I dwell on yesterday.

Completely severed, it’s already done  
If you want, leave me to time  
I’ve grown up with you, essentially.  
Completely severed, it’s already done  
If you want, leave me to time  
I’ve grown up with you, essentially.

While forgetting you, I wake up remembering  
Still thinking I’m yours  
I don’t know your heart,  
But mine is burning badly.  
I don’t know your heart,  
But mine is burning badly.  
Ayyy, yaaa, yaa, ayyy.
