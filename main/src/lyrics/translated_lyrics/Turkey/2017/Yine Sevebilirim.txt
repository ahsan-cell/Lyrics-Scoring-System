**Translated Lyrics:**

About the dream I saw last night  
I have no one but you, that I know of  
Is it courage or fear, I wonder?  

Even if you're not by my side, Iâ€™m still living on  

Ah, I can love life again  
Ah, I can find love again  
Ah, I can hear once more, it seems  
The songs playing inside me  

A strange feeling, dancing with your absence  
The whole world feels like a stage beneath me  
I have no place to call home, I realized, except for you  
Is my heart afraid of something similar, I wonder?  

Even if you're not by my side, you're already in my blood  

Ah, I can love life again, even when it seems over  
Ah, I can find love again, even when it seems gone  
Ah, I can hear once more, it seems  
The songs that remain within me
