**Translated Lyrics:**

Your name is different, your taste is different  
You can't fit in my hands  
You're crazy, you know  

I wish you'd live with me  
What you know isn't just memorized  
You're new, you see  

**[Chorus]**  
Is it in vain that like a leaf  
I got swept away by your wind?  
Forgetting myself  
I got caught up in a madman’s dream  

With one foot outside the threshold  
If you leave, you leave  
This heart has long been content with you  
As you wish  

**[Verse 2]**  
With your piercing eyes  
And your unspoken words  
You’re a mystery, you are  

Without any games, without any troubles  
Neither less nor more  
You are my life, you see  

**[Chorus]**  
Is it in vain that like a leaf  
I got swept away by your wind?  
Forgetting myself  
I got caught up in a madman’s dream  

With one foot outside the threshold  
If you leave, you leave  
This heart has long been content with you  
As you wish  

**[Verse 3]**  
Before you, after you  
Two separate eras, two different worlds  
Nothing will ever be the same  
In the tomorrows to come  

**[Chorus]**  
Is it in vain that like a leaf  
I got swept away by your wind?  
Forgetting myself  
I got caught up in a madman’s dream  

With one foot outside the threshold  
If you leave, you leave  
This heart has long been content with you  
As you wish
