**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Look at the comfort of the night’s shadow,  
And turn to the fate of my destiny, my dear.  
Your dreams will understand you,  
Now look at the state of your homeland.  
The world has packed its bags,  
It’s leaving, leaving us with more than enough.  
It won’t glance back behind,  
Come and taste the bomb in my heart.  
We placed justice in the center,  
“Turn,” it said, and we turned to its whim.  
The poor have no knowledge of money,  
But the rich put their fruits in their vodka.  
Come on, you’ve struck my heart,  
Tell me, who cares for whom?  
A snake lies in your embrace,  
Just place a kiss upon your neck.

[Chorus]  
Just stay a moment by my side,  
I’m left in blood and sweat at the edge.  
If Azrael winks,  
And death opens its arms to us.  
Just stay a moment by my side,  
I’m left in blood and sweat at the edge.  
If Azrael winks,  
And death opens its arms to us.

[Bridge]  
Morning has fallen over the night,  
I’ve fallen upon it, upon it.  
On top of that, the estranged ones,  
Are resentful of the night.  
If the pen and paper are taken,  
If the sun has wrapped the night,  
If death is standing at the door,  
If fate has become our end.

[Verse]  
Look at the comfort of the night’s shadow,  
And turn to the fate of my destiny, my dear.  
Your dreams will understand you,  
Now look at the state of your homeland.  
The world has packed its bags,  
It’s leaving, leaving us with more than enough.  
It won’t glance back behind,  
Come and taste the bomb in my heart.  
We placed justice in the center,  
“Turn,” it said, and we turned to its whim.  
The poor have no knowledge of money,  
But the rich put their fruits in their vodka.  
Come on, you’ve struck my heart,  
Tell me, who cares for whom?  
A snake lies in your embrace,  
Just place a kiss upon your neck.

[Chorus]  
Just stay a moment by my side,  
I’m left in blood and sweat at the edge.  
If Azrael winks,  
And death opens its arms to us.  
Just stay a moment by my side,  
I’m left in blood and sweat at the edge.  
If Azrael winks,  
And death opens its arms to us.
