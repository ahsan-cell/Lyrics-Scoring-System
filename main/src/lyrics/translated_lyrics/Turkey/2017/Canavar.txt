**Translated Lyrics:**

Let him turn his face away, standing proud  
Let him not look, if he wants, let him be silent  
My back is to him, let him speak over there  

How well I raised him, nurtured him  
I’ve grown a beautiful ingrate  
Health to my hands, what have I done?  
I’ve made myself a monster, oh  

How well I raised him, nurtured him  
I’ve grown a beautiful ingrate  
Health to my hands, what have I done?  
I’ve made myself a monster  

Is the praise for me or for him?  
For the treacherous snake in my embrace?  
The shameless one isn’t the world, it’s my hand  
And that monster is my masterpiece  

Is the praise for me or for him?  
For the treacherous snake in my embrace?  
The shameless one isn’t the world, it’s my hand  
And that monster is my masterpiece  

Are you ready to hear?  
Now he doesn’t like me anymore  
Let him turn his face away, standing proud  
Let him not look, if he wants, let him be silent  
My back is to him, let him speak over there  

Now he doesn’t like me anymore  
Let him turn his face away, standing proud  
Let him not look, if he wants, let him be silent  
My back is to him, let him speak over there  

Now he doesn’t like me anymore  
Let him turn his face away, standing proud  
Let him not look, if he wants, let him be silent  
My back is to him, let him speak over there  

Now he doesn’t like me anymore  
Let him turn his face away, standing proud  
Let him not look, if he wants, let him be silent  
My back is to him, let him speak over there
