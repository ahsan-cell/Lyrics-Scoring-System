**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Despite everything, today has come to an end  
All voices fell silent, lost with the sun  
All thoughts washed ashore  
Oh, what a whirlwind took them away  

[Chorus]  
Write, write, it never ends, my life isn't enough  
Tell the song, tell it one last time  
In this fairytale, there are those who are unhappy  
The prince and princess are left alone  
Write, write, it never ends, my life isn't enough  
Tell the song, tell it one last time  
In this fairytale, there are those who are unhappy  
The prince and princess are left alone  

[Verse]  
Despite everything, today has come to an end  
All voices fell silent, lost with the sun  
All thoughts washed ashore  
Oh, what a whirlwind took them away  

[Chorus]  
Write, write, it never ends, my life isn't enough  
Tell the song, tell it one last time  
In this fairytale, there are those who are unhappy  
The prince and princess are left alone  
Write, write, it never ends, my life isn't enough  
Tell the song, tell it one last time  
In this fairytale, there are those who are unhappy  
The prince and princess are left alone  
(My life isn't enough)  
Tell the song, (tell it one last time)  
In this fairytale (there are those who are unhappy)  
The prince and princess are left alone
