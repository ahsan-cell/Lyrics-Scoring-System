**Translated Lyrics:**

They can't withstand the storm  
My dear, my dear, my darling  
You're my most precious one  

They can't find me without you  
Even the birds won't come by  
My dear, my dear, my darling  
You're my most precious one  

Evenings and mornings  
Are always the same for me  
I can't look, what's the need?  
Why are these mirrors even here?  

Look at the shawl on me  
There's still a strand of your hair  
Don't think I've come to my senses  
There's still a madman here  

There's the option of not loving another  
Of dying without ever seeing  
There's the chance to shout and say  
My precious, come back to me  

There's the option of loving no one  
Of dying without ever seeing  
There's the chance to say it all  
My precious, come back to me  
My precious, that direction is here  

Evenings and mornings  
Are always the same for me  
I can't look, what's the need?  
Why are these mirrors even here?  

Look at the shawl on me  
There's still a strand of your hair  
Don't think I've come to my senses  
There's still a madman here  

There's the option of not loving another  
Of dying without ever seeing  
There's the chance to shout and say  
My precious, come back to me  

There's the option of loving no one  
Of dying without ever seeing  
There's the chance to say it all  
My precious, come back to me  
My precious, that direction is here
