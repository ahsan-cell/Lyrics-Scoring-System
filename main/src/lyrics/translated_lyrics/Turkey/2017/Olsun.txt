**Translated Lyrics:**

I didn’t count, after an hour  
I was full, full, I grew tired  
Closed doors, I tried, I pushed  
But I couldn’t open them...  
It’s okay, it’s okay, I tied myself to you  

Ah, my love, when I look into your eyes  
I lose myself, my beloved...  
Is it forgotten like this when it ends?  
Just tell me, so I can know too...  

I burned, does the place you went keep you cool?  
I was deceived, may your loving hands convince you too.
