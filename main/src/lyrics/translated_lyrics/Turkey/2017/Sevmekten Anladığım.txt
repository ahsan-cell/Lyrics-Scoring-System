**Translated Lyrics:**

Deleting a photo is harder than erasing a memory  
We couldn't go far, forgive me  
Northern lights in my room, a lamp  
If the caravan has broken down  
Before we hit the road  
Remember  
I was a child in the stadium  
You were April 23rd*

If someone could take a step forward and two steps back  
We could have fallen in love again  
If someone could take a step forward and two steps back  
Maybe we could be lovers

Just one sentence from you was enough to warm my heart  
What remains of my youthful fire?  
There were times I slept on your lap  
Which film should I hide it in?  
Where should I keep it alive?  
If we could turn back time  
You to the past, me to the crazy days  
When I jumped onto the field  
On those away game days

You don't need to be a tree  
To love just one leaf  
With time, with time, with time  
Don't believe the lies, donâ€™t be late  
We're here for eternity  

*April 23rd is celebrated as National Sovereignty and Children's Day in Turkey, symbolizing childhood and innocence.
