**Translated Lyrics:**

Don’t be fooled by what you hear,  
Always flashy, teasing here and there,  
I’ve wandered around, everywhere.  

I’m not what I seem to be,  
Not the person you think of me,  
Let them talk, it’s fine,  
I really don’t mind.  

Don’t think I’m high and mighty,  
I don’t believe in fairy tales,  
At the ball, everyone’s wearing masks,  
That’s just how it is, after all.  

Come on now, come to my side,  
Don’t wear me out with that long ride,  
I won’t promise you in vain,  
Don’t be so surprised, this is just the beginning.  

Don’t get caught up in this or that,  
No one else has this aura,  
When morning comes,  
I’ve got a surprise, oh la la.  

Come on now, come to my side,  
Don’t wear me out with that long ride,  
I won’t promise you in vain,  
Don’t be so surprised, this is just the beginning.  

Hey, look at me, fearless and bold,  
Don’t be fooled by what you hear,  
Always flashy, teasing here and there,  
I’ve wandered around, everywhere.  

I’m not what I seem to be,  
Not the person you think of me,  
Let them talk, it’s fine,  
I really don’t mind.  

Don’t think I’m high and mighty,  
I don’t believe in fairy tales,  
At the ball, everyone’s wearing masks,  
That’s just how it is, after all.  

Come on now, come to my side,  
Don’t wear me out with that long ride,  
I won’t promise you in vain,  
Don’t be so surprised, this is just the beginning.  

Don’t get caught up in this or that,  
No one else has this aura,  
When morning comes,  
I’ve got a surprise, oh la la.  

Come on now, come to my side,  
Don’t wear me out with that long ride,  
I won’t promise you in vain,  
Don’t be so surprised, this is just the beginning.  

Don’t get caught up in this or that,  
No one else has this aura,  
When morning comes,  
I’ve got a surprise, oh la la.
