**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part I: FOR WHAT REASON]**

**[Intro]**  
(Archie)

**[Chorus]**  
For what reason, for what? You gave up on both of us  
Damn your relationship, tell me, for what reason?  
You ruined us, even if I knew it wouldn’t change a thing  
What do I know, just tell me, for what reason?  
I had risked so much for you, after all  
I fought with gods to find peace in your presence  
As time passes, your absence turned into thirst  
I crave just a sip, tell me, for what reason?

**[Verse]**  
He said, "You stubborn fool, it was all for you  
I was always yours, but you didn’t change for me  
You lost to your pride, shaped this situation  
Your choices are the cause, now you know for what reason, for what."  
I don’t care, the past is new horizons  
Unexplored corners called to me, this gamble  
I lost, I’ve become a part of you, take it, it’s yours (Take it)  
My clothes are torn and tattered, my background’s a mess  
What happened yesterday? It’s a wreck around me, tell me (Tell me)  
Caught in the thorns, the woman got upset but we made up  
"Filtering foolishness" they say love is, if it kisses, it’s fine (Fine)  
I thought I lost my mind, oh, mixed with snow  
My body fought, so I’m not dead yet (Yet)  
It was sequential, past experiences repeated  
Look, we were spent quickly, generous time (Time)  
They swallowed the bait with pleasure, they gave up, found jobs  
The satellites in my orbit, their complaints unheard  
A drifter cares about what you have for your sake  
You’re the reason for my madness.

**[Bridge]**  
Ah, for what reason, ah, for what reason?  
Ah, for what reason, tell me, for what reason?  
You gave up on both of us, damn your relationship  
You ruined us, if you knew, tell me, for what reason?  
Tell me, for what reason?  
Tell me, for what reason?  
Tell me, for what reason?  
Tell me, for what reason?

**[Part II: RABBIT]**

**[Chorus]**  
My weapons are updating themselves  
My crosshairs are roaming over you  
Your hypocrisy is on my agenda  
Your community doesn’t touch, you hit a wall  
You have a rabbit hunt, you want justice, God willing, God willing  
Listening to your nonsense, sell, lifeless people  
We’re behind you, God’s snitch, attention freak  
You’re someone who can tear off an arm without giving a hand.

**[Verse]**  
Don’t trip me up, I can’t stand your whims, your prayers, I can’t be your father (Your father)  
Your suffering is written, your cries are in vain behind me  
Your anxiety for the future outweighs your self-respect (Outweighs)  
You opened fronts, bombarded  
No customers, the joke is gone  
The nonsense you sold wasn’t bought by consumers  
Your financial struggles give me chills  
The detonator that went out of service exploded  
I don’t think you’re men, you couldn’t even be men  
You were naive, you should have been thrown out at the first chance  
I won’t urinate on the wounds you licked  
I can’t waste time, my fortune has fled from my possessions  
With all those banks, promissory notes were made, risks taken, troubles to come  
If I could keep my patience, my faith, God  
When I needed it, it was always there  
Take me by your side, come to my rescue, I’ve outgrown my vessel  
I gave up my share, my inheritance  
In this age of fakeness, I won’t join the caravan  
I won’t faint your **** in a live broadcast in the name of "marketing."

**[Chorus]**  
My weapons are updating themselves  
My crosshairs are roaming over you  
Your hypocrisy is on my agenda  
Your community doesn’t touch, you hit a wall  
You have a rabbit hunt, you want justice, God willing, God willing  
Listening to your nonsense, sell, lifeless people  
We’re behind you, God’s snitch, attention freak  
You’re someone who can tear off an arm without giving a hand.
