**Translated Lyrics:**

Even if you struggle, you can't escape  
Even if you open your mouth, you can't speak  
Even if you struggle, you can't escape  
Even if you open your mouth, you can't speak  

They laugh at your state  
They pity you  
Thoughts wrap around, all the beautiful colors fade  

[Chorus: Ata Demirer, Melek Büyükçınar, Together]  
Ah, maybe you want to forget the past  
You want to forget the days of freedom  
Maybe you want to forget the past  
You want to forget the days of freedom  

The moon rises every night  
If only you would come out one night  
Please, please  
Don't forget me  

[Verse 2: Ata Demirer, Melek Büyükçınar, Together]  
That morning is a memory, that dead-end street  
In your smile, we find a thousand sorrows  
That morning is a memory, that dead-end street  
In your smile, we find a thousand sorrows  

Let the songs of the past sing now  
Sing without stopping  
Don't forget me  

[Chorus: Ata Demirer & Melek Büyükçınar, Together]  
Ah, maybe you want to forget the past  
You want to forget the days of freedom  
Maybe you want to forget the past  
You want to forget the days of freedom  

The moon rises every night  
If only you would come out one night  
Please, please  
Don't forget me  

[Outro: Ata Demirer]  
Please, please  
Don't forget me
