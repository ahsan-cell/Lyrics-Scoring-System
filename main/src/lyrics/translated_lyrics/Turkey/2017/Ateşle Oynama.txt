**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Sıla]**  
My love, you and I understand  
Very different things about love  
You are devoted to power, while I am to love  
That's why we can't agree  

**[Pre-Chorus: Sıla & Erol Evgin]**  
Inside me, there’s a vast space  
Enough for you and for others too  
This heart dies of love a thousand times  
And is reborn a thousand times with love  
What loves come and go  
Everything changes, people change  
Years later, everyone will be ashamed  
Of these empty, meaningless little games  

**[Chorus: Sıla, Erol Evgin, Sıla & Erol Evgin]**  
Don't play with fire, don't play with fire  
In the end, your hands and tongues will burn  
If you want, come hit me one more time  
Where you strike, roses will bloom  
Don't play with fire, don't play with fire  
In the end, your hands and tongues will burn  
If you want, come hit me one more time  
Where you strike, roses will bloom  

**[Verse 2: Erol Evgin]**  
My love, this war is senseless  
Love is stronger than wars  
Fights will end, this life will end  
My love, love will save us  

**[Pre-Chorus: Sıla & Erol Evgin]**  
Inside me, there’s a vast space  
Enough for you and for others too  
This heart dies of love a thousand times  
And is reborn a thousand times with love  
What loves come and go  
Everything changes, people change  
Years later, everyone will be ashamed  
Of these empty, meaningless little games  

**[Chorus: Erol Evgin, Sıla, Erol Evgin & Sıla]**  
Don't play with fire, don't play with fire  
In the end, your hands and tongues will burn  
If you want, come hit me one more time  
Where you strike, roses will bloom  
Don't play with fire, don't play with fire  
In the end, your hands and tongues will burn  
If you want, come hit me one more time  
Where you strike, roses will bloom  
Don't play with fire, don't play with fire  
In the end, your hands and tongues will burn  
If you want, come hit me one more time  
Where you strike, roses will bloom  
Don't play with fire, don't play with fire  
In the end, your hands and tongues will burn  
If you want, come hit me one more time  
Where you strike, roses will bloom
