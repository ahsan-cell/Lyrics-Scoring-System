**Translated Lyrics:**

I turned my face back to you, my love  
Once again, I stand before you  
Shall we try just one more time?  
We’re already familiar with each other  
*I burned out, yet you didn’t even glance  
They asked about you again  
All our friends were worn out  
As if they were soldiers, you know?*

**Pre-Chorus: Murat Dalkılıç**  
Of course, I say that he’s in love too  
I’m not pushing it these days  
Whoever I see, I say he won’t forget me  
This is what I’m saying

**Chorus: Oğuzhan Koç**  
Let him stay on the side and watch, let him relax  
I’m a moth around you  
If he just glances at me sideways  
Let everyone be a witness

**Post-Chorus: Murat Dalkılıç**  
Just let him not touch, let him watch and feel shy  
There’s no one like me, he knows it too  
Especially if he becomes mine  
Let the whole city wake up  
Where’s my mind, let them look  
Where’s my mind, let them- (look)

**Bridge**  
Let him stay on the side and watch, let him relax  
I’m a moth

**Chorus: Murat Dalkılıç**  
Let him stay on the side and watch, let him relax  
I’m a moth around you  
If he just glances at me sideways  
Let everyone be a witness

**Post-Chorus: Oğuzhan Koç**  
Just let him not touch, let him watch and feel shy  
There’s no one like me, he knows it too  
Especially if he becomes mine  
Let the whole city wake up  
Where’s my mind, let them look  
Where’s my mind, let them-
