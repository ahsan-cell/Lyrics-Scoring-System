**Translated Lyrics:**

I've never experienced anything like this before  
What I thought turned out to be true, what I believed  

I had things to tell and things I understood  
I searched, and suddenly found what I was looking for  
But you were never there  

To see that beautiful face, I wake up in the middle of the night  
My thirsty lips part, yearning for a touch  
You either smile at me or say something  
If we are alive,  
If we are alive,  
Living like this is worth everything  

I don’t know who or what anyone else is  
Someone has rung the bell  
No, I can’t hear it  
A storm has risen in my chest, I’m listening to you, my love  

Great loves always come to an end  
Alright, I’m not afraid  
They said come with your horses, but I’m not going  
I crashed questions into questions  
I won’t divide myself for you  
My love, my love, my love  

To see that beautiful face, I wake up in the middle of the night  
My thirsty lips part, yearning for a touch  
You either smile at me or say something  
If we are alive,  
If we are alive,  
Living like this is worth everything  

I don’t know who or what anyone else is  
Someone has rung the bell  
No, I can’t hear it  
A storm has risen in my chest, I’m listening to you, my love  

Great loves always come to an end  
Alright, I’m not afraid  
They said come with your horses, but I’m not going  
I crashed questions into questions  
I won’t divide myself for you  
My love, my love, my love
