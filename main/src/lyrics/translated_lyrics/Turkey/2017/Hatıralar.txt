**[Intro]**  
Ah!

**[Verse 1]**  
Time travel ends in loss, scold your fears,  
A letter left on your desk, that’s what you find here.  
In summer, I breathe you in, in winter, I’m breathless, suddenly (Yeah),  
That moment, cobalt blues appeared in the sky so harshly (A'ight).  
Tell me, you adjust to your childhood that’s grown old with your crowd,  
You have no hopes, leaning on your tears like a ladder now.  
Meaningless, uncertain memories have gnawed at my flesh,  
Indifference has truly damaged all my strength (Ah!).  
When I was very small, monsters would make me cry, now they’ve turned pink,  
I’ve become more alienated by the uselessness of being alive.  
For twenty-five years, darkness accompanied the light’s web,  
The light has abandoned me; look, I have a blood bond with the dark (Yeah).  
One notebook, a thousand laments, humans made of flesh, tongue heavy (Ah),  
Hands write for one reason (Ah), come curse and shout (Yeah).  
As if life is deaf; it doesn’t hear, treacherous, it’s quite lowly to me,  
The streets know this rogue well, shout with an open collar (Ah!).

**[Chorus]**  
Your dream has no place, time wraps around, slipping from my hands,  
This land tightens me, condemning my today-o-o-or.  
Your dream has no place, time wraps around, slipping from my hands,  
This land tightens me (Wow), condemning my today-o-o-or.

**[Verse 2]**  
It seems all happy songs exist just to tease,  
Pulled from my arm, there are lights far away, tearing the heavens apart.  
Read from my facial features, I’ve stained this sea because of the life I lived in the first quarter, that’s why the seagulls died (Yeah).  
You’re a child spoiled by existence, far from emotions (Ha),  
In your absence, leave me in poor dreams (Shh!).  
If you don’t want me, it’ll break me when it comes, your heart at a standstill,  
A suffocating week, my twenty-four hours are smoke.  
Health and wellness lost; the last period is a month of mourning,  
I’m tired of watching, the past pulled the retina from my eyes.  
Let your knees stay on the ground, don’t bother getting up (Yeah),  
I didn’t write this; you all created this theme (Ah).  
What I tell is the truth,  
Time moved without waiting, as if a year was just a minute.  
After this border, there’s a path, stay real,  
What state am I in? If you don’t know, they always burn you (Wow).

**[Chorus]**  
Your dream has no place, time wraps around, slipping from my hands,  
This land tightens me, condemning my today-o-o-or.  
Your dream has no place, time wraps around, slipping from my hands,  
This land tightens me, condemning my today-o-o-or.

**[Outro]**  
—Ah!  
—Ah!
