**Translated Lyrics:**

Yep (Aww)  
Yep (Mmm-aww)  
Uh-huh  
Yes  

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]  
Yes, it's been a long time, but I'm back (Uh)  
You're not dealing with the same guy (No)  
I was feeling a bit off, then I switched it up (Yes)  
My new attitude is mixed with pure audacity (Aww)  
Night game, your girl called  
"Come on, baby, are you busy, busy?" she said (Yes)  
No dice, just relax, sweetie (No)  
In life, I feel dazed  
Oh, I've got visions about the city and I'm going to war  
See me from morning till night (Night)  
Tell them this is attraction, I'm in freeze mode against the gods  
You can't stop a hero in flight (Flight)  
I'm swimming in the light, that's right, go get something  
Yeah, I let my balls hang (Yes)  
A quick pre-game with LeBron or Dwyane Wade (Yes)  
Aww, we're taking off  
If you can't stop this Black man's rise, best get lost, move on (Uh)  
Don't want the journey, do you want to take charge? (Uh)  
Don't want to move, don't get me wrong (No)  
They aren't listening to the words in the songs (Uh-huh)  
We don't have to tell them, we're just getting started (Yes)  
We saw them act different than they are, we’re not joking  
If you want it, you can have it  
From the members of anger, come and take some  
Next step is jumping off your jet  
We're spinning around the world and we don’t even have luggage  
Hit them, vroom vroom, squeeze, oh, did you see that?  
I'm enjoying myself, where's the crew?  
I saw a black Benz, they're dropping something, yes, I need that  
So wild, I can't believe it  
No cameras, damn, they aren't even recording, real Black truths (Come on)  
Years ago, rehab  
Everything's good, helped me find another plan  
It got worse, it got really bad  
No, I don't like this, man  
Then I stepped out to a new area with my Louis bag  
True story, I'll take you from darkness to light  
Godson, I encountered new things  
I returned to the world, that day in this life (Cud)  
Light up the smoke and take it (Dude)  
I raised the bars (Uh), same song, we made it (Yes)  
Hot sauce, pour it over your jams, uncensored  
Keep going, take a strong hit, bring your mom down with it (Come on)  
And the game needed something dirty  
Tell them this is law and we cleaned up the unwanted weeds  

[Verse 2: Eminem]  
If this is the God you believe in (Yes)  
Nod your head up and down, just to confirm (Yes)  
They say time is unbeatable  
I'm the first to beat it (Yes)  
I had dreams of the hoop, now I'm shooting threes (What?)  
I got a little green (Yes), but I don't smoke (No)  
Neither weed nor lean, this is Tunechi (Yes)  
This is New Orleans (What?), I don't care about Drew Brees (Yes)  
Snoop D-O-double (Uh), these are 2 G's (Yes)  
I'm spending on papers, ooh-wee  
Since Tuesday, I probably killed a few trees (Yes)  
But the only thing I’m puffing is fallen leaves  
I’m not flying, but I’m higher than you (What?)  
And secretly, you’re on my dick (Ha)  
But you haters have a pain in your ass (Ow), a bundle of hurt in your rear (Ow)  
I was a poor white kid (Yes)  
Now if rap were basketball, I’d be something like Jordan, bitch (What?)  
You wish you could score like this (No), Yes  
And I wouldn’t even miss from half court (No)  
I’m gargling, because if I were on the ground, I’d shoot without a hole  
But I can’t lie (No)  
I put you on my "Top 5"  
"The Worst Rappers of All Time" (Ha)  
Did I lose my spot? You all must have Alzheimer’s (Uh)  
Am I the king of rap? No, that’s their word, not mine (Yes)  
I’m the king of curses and I’m not lying (Yes)  
You should never compare with yours (No)  
This is a free hotline (Yes), you can only own hot bars like this  
What
