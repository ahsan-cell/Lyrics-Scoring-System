**Storm in My Heart**

Without consulting me at all,  
Love stands at my door.  
You, who bring harmony to spring,  
The climbing vine that bears seven fruits.  
If you could find life in my sun and embrace me,  
Oh beloved, what would happen if you touched me just once?  

My heart is shedding leaves,  
If you saw me, it’s you I’d be.  
My state is like autumn,  
Your skin draws near to me,  
Touching my lips softly.  
Your dream isn’t enough,  
Come, be by my side.  

Loves, oh loves,  
Sometimes they laugh, sometimes they cry.  
What beauty, oh God,  
Is harmful to the heart.  
Should I go or should I stay?  
Should I ask Mecnun?*  
It turns to ash, it cannot withstand the fire,  
This city burns.  

(*Mecnun is a character from Turkish literature, known for his deep love and longing.)
