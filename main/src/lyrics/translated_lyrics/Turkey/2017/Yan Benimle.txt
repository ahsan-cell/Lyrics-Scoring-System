**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
I was deceived by false joy,  
Caught in the trap of your mind,  
Forgive my faults, I came in a daze,  
At five in the morning, I knocked on your door.  
Since love is my master,  
And since the forbidden is unholy,  
In this cage, words are silent for now,  
Time will carry us away, just wait and see.

[Bridge]  
The night drapes over you like a long coat,  
It doesn’t offer companionship, it just evades the rhyme,  
Memories have settled, they won’t rise, they don’t understand the state,  
Like an ocean of thoughts.

[Chorus]  
I wandered through your streets, street by street,  
Honestly, there’s no accounting, no calculations,  
Inside me, a cry, a shout,  
Burn, burn, burn with me,  
As if heading down a long road,  
Don’t look at me like that!  
Oh my dear, don’t do this!  
I wandered through your streets, street by street,  
Honestly, there’s no accounting, no calculations,  
Inside me, a cry, a shout,  
Burn, burn, burn with me,  
As if heading down a long road,  
Don’t look at me like that!  
Oh my dear, don’t do this!

[Bridge]

[Outro]  
Oh my dear, don’t do this!
