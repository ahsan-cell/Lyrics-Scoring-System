**Translated Lyrics:**

I burn, these mountains feel too small for me, oh  
Stay, let your stones be scattered and worn  
Your hands are my pillow, my blanket, your golden hair  
Stay, don’t leave, the thought of you is with me  
Even if you love someone else  
Please don’t go, I would die then  
My love, don’t go, I would die then  

Stay, today my heart aches  
My hands are searching for your skin  
My hair aches in strands  
I would die, oh I would die then  

Wait, today my soul is bent  
I’m tired, it’s hard to forget  
To hold the same wish every day  
I would die, oh I would die then  

Take me on the road, bring me back to my love, oh  
Road, be my companion, smile at me, oh  
Take a rose, give birth to it in my hands, in my lungs  
I’ve burned, may peace be upon the others  
Stay, don’t leave, the thought of you is with me  
Even if you love someone else  
Please don’t go, I would die then  
My love, don’t go, I would die then  

Stay, today my heart aches  
My hands are searching for your skin  
My hair aches in strands  
I would die, oh I would die then  

Wait, today my soul is bent  
I’m tired, it’s hard to forget  
To hold the same wish every day  
I would die, oh I would die then
