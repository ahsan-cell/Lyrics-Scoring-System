**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**  
Lol, lol  
Lol-lol  
Lol, lol  
Na-na-na-na-na-na  
Lol, lol  
Lol-lol  
Lol, lol  
Na-na-na-na-na-na  
Na-na-na-na-na-na  

**[Verse 1]**  
Why is everyone so serious?  
Unread books but all bound up  
People with frowns on their faces  
Locked up tight to the core  
No smiles, no good mornings here  
Of course, there’s plenty of drama on page three  
News always breaking, shock after shock  
Living stubbornly, right here and now  

**[Bridge]**  
So they can say "we're alive"  
So they love us a lot  
Oh, oh  

**[Chorus]**  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
The wind blows against us again  
Ah, a harsh autumn lies ahead  
Oh  

**[Chorus]**  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  

**[Verse 2]**  
Why is everyone so serious?  
Unread books but all bound up  
People with frowns on their faces  
Locked up tight to the core  
That playground inside me  
No lace, no paint, no mask at all  
Come on, close your eyes and dream  
La-la-la-la, a scene from the amusement park  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
The wind blows against us again  
Ah, a harsh autumn lies ahead  
Oh  

**[Chorus]**  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  

**[Bridge]**  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  

**[Chorus]**  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!  
Lol, lol, come on, let’s party, party  
Lol, lol, bring your heart to its knees, knees  
Lol, lol, what’s this battle really about, about?  
Long live life, this is our manifesto!
