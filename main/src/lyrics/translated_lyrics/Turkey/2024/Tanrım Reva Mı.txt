**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Is it fair, my God?  
This fate makes me pay for what I see  
My cries have faded away again  
What’s the explanation? I could never think  
I assumed it would be as it is, I didn’t say  
I couldn’t leave those who left  
Is it fair, my God?  
This fate makes me pay for what I see  
My cries have faded away again  
What’s the explanation? I could never think  
I assumed it would be as it is, I didn’t say  
I couldn’t leave those who left  

[Verse]  
It’s hard, it burns my soul  
Every word strikes me again  
I have no eyes for anything anymore  
These days, my spirit is on edge  
Every changing intention has tired my false friend (my false friend)  
Hearts were broken, their importance is gone  
The taste of every promise was stale  
Years have passed, and now my hopes are left in the cold
