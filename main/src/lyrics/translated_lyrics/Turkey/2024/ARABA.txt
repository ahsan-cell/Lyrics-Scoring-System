**[Intro]**  
(D-D-D-DIVXRSE)

**[Verse]**  
Yeah, car, gear "forward," speed limit's mine, I press on, I'll pay, ha  
The police will catch me, ha let’s turn back from here, I didn’t know about this, ha  
Now they caught me but let’s sort it out before they take me to the station, hey  
Nothing's gonna happen, right? This matters, don’t tell my dad, yeah  
Hm, my new model car  
Style's rich, come on, new highway  
Prayers from mom come through, slip away  
God gives to the working man  
Nah, got my new girl in the car  
Target Rotterdam, my map can’t be messed with  
Blood in your veins, style’s stolen, Karakan  
What do I care? Come on, you can't have my fajita  
Those who can’t handle it should get out of the car  
Without knowing me, saying "How cruel you are"  
You can’t be my rival, "you’re like a dog," your breed is off  
You couldn’t calculate, you’re still lacking vitamins  
You’ll get up and  
You’ll come to my studio too  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba, Allah Allah  
I’ll hit him on the head bam-bam-bam, here  
No stopping like that, look at me, keep going in the air, on land  
I’m cursing those who sell what they drink, you’re no good for the homeland, oh dear  
You won’t be worth a cucumber but I’ll throw you in my salad, look  
Of course, you can’t solve it, but this is a favor from me to you  

**[Chorus]**  
Car, gear—  
I press on, I pay—  
Yeah, car vi—  
I press on, I’ll pay, ha
