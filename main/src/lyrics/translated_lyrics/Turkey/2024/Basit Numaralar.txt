**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Nights have become forbidden, look, these days  
I won't be fooled anymore, those simple games  
I've forgotten you, the wounds have closed  
If you miss me, don't call, the doors are shut  
Nights have become forbidden, look, these days  
I won't be fooled anymore, those simple games  
I've forgotten you, the wounds have closed  
If you miss me, don't call, the doors are shut  
Nights have become forbidden, look, these days  
I won't be fooled anymore, those simple games  
I've forgotten you, the wounds have closed  
If you miss me, don't call, the doors are shut  

[Verse]  
You used to say you forgot me, yeah  
Remember when you wouldn’t see anyone else, yeah  
If I left, you wouldn’t take me back, yeah  
You wouldn’t die for this love, yeah  

[Bridge]  
Burns, burns, my heart for love  
Lies, lies, you've long crossed the line  
Oh, oh, oh, this patience has overflowed  
From time to time, you’ll miss the love  

[Chorus]  
Nights have become forbidden, look, these days  
I won't be fooled anymore, those simple games  
I've forgotten you, the wounds have closed  
If you miss me, don't call, the doors are shut  
Nights have become forbidden, look, these days  
I won't be fooled anymore, those simple games  
I've forgotten you, the wounds have closed  
If you miss me, don't call, the doors are shut  
Nights have become forbidden, look, these days  
I won't be fooled anymore, those simple games  
I've forgotten you, the wounds have closed  
If you miss me, don't call, the doors are shut  

[Outro]  
Burns, burns, my heart for love
