**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
I waited for you like the sunrise, all night long  
You’re the cure to every pain, come without asking  

**[Chorus]**  
I burned with a single glance, what a figure is this?  
Your eyes took my mind away, like an ocean  
Oh, I’ve become longing itself, Leyla*  
What kind of invitation is this? My heart stopped, is this how love feels?  

**[Verse 2]**  
Take me, hold me close to your heart, let the world turn  
Maybe it’s a lie, maybe a fairy tale, I don’t mind at all  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Write it line by line, take my fate in your hands, I’ve gone mad  
I haven’t been swept away by anyone like this, you’ve become a gift  

**[Chorus]**  
I burned with a single glance, what a figure is this?  
Your eyes took my mind away—  
I burned with a single glance, what a figure is this?  
Your eyes took my mind away, like an ocean  
Oh, I’ve become longing itself, Leyla  
What kind of invitation is this? My heart stopped, is this how love feels?  

**[Verse 3]**  
There’s no description for it  
It’s like a long vacation  
Love is like this, come on, my darling  
Give me your hand, it’s so delicate  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Write it line by line, take my fate in your hands, I’ve gone mad  
I haven’t been swept away by anyone like this, you’ve become a gift  

**[Chorus]**  
I burned with a single glance, what a figure is this?  
Your eyes took my mind away, like an ocean  
Oh, I’ve become longing itself, Leyla  
What kind of invitation is this? My heart stopped, is this how love feels?
