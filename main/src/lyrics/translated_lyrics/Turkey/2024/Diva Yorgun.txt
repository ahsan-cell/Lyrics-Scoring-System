**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
You knew this diva is weary,  
Words don’t reach your heart,  
Every day you come to me, my dear,  
A moon will rise in my life.  
From the worst of it, even worse,  
My mind was protected by the Lord.  
I looked up to the sky and saw the sun,  
Has my fortune turned, or what?

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Tell me, is your heart sweet too, for real?  
Is the lover justified?  
Doesn’t it feel like it can’t contain you?  
Is your heart hidden in your hands, full of sorrow?

**[Chorus]**  
I didn’t know this before you,  
Those spring winds weren’t worth it.  
I was naive, just a foolish being,  
I learned from your face.  
Snow fell into my hair, hold my hand,  
Will we not reach our destination, what is this?  
I am content with what comes from you, my dear,  
I found joy within myself,  
Did you see it in my eyes?

**[Verse 2]**  
My dark-eyed one, if we built a home,  
It would be lush and green.  
In its frame, in its garden,  
Would doves converse?  
You became paradise, play my sorrow’s string,  
My heart will heal.  
When I look into your eyes, the seven worlds unite.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Tell me, is your heart sweet too, for real?  
Is the lover justified?  
Doesn’t it feel like it can’t contain you?  
Is your heart hidden in your hands, full of sorrow?

**[Chorus]**  
I didn’t know this before you,  
Those spring winds weren’t worth it.  
I was naive, just a foolish being,  
I learned from your face.  
Snow fell into my hair, hold my hand,  
Will we not reach our destination, what is this?  
I am content with what comes from you, my dear,  
I found joy within myself.  
I didn’t know this before you,  
Those spring winds weren’t worth it.  
I was naive, just a foolish being,  
I learned from your face.  
Snow fell into my hair, hold my hand,  
Will we not reach our destination, what is this?  
I am content...
