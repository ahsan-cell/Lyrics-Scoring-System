**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Burak Bulut & Kurtuluş Kuş]  
It happens, paths may part  
But still, don’t forget me, my magnolia  
All dreams feel empty  
Your eyes don’t align with the topic  
You know, those smiles, I wish they could be sold for money  
I have hope, you have modesty  
I’m returning on foot to the roads I once ran, oh  

Paths may part  
But still, don’t forget me, my magnolia  
All dreams feel empty  
Your eyes don’t align with the topic  
You know, those smiles, I wish they could be sold for money  
I have hope, you have modesty  
I’m returning on foot to the roads I once ran  

[Bridge: Burak Bulut]  
Will I turn back?  
Tender sidewalks are my home  
I can’t write about being without you; if you’re leaving, it’s the right time  
This is proof of my love, “My compass isn’t finding me,” it said  
My tongue no longer turns to your lies, your dreams  
Will I turn back?  
Tender sidewalks are my home  
I can’t write about being without you; if you’re leaving, it’s the right time  
This is proof of my love, “My compass isn’t finding me,” it said  
My tongue no longer turns to your lies, your dreams  

[Chorus: Kurtuluş Kuş & Burak Bulut]  
It happens, paths may part  
But still, don’t forget me, my magnolia  
All dreams feel empty  
Your eyes don’t align with the topic  
You know, those smiles, I wish they could be sold for money  
I have hope, you have modesty  
I’m returning on foot to the roads I once ran  

[Bridge: Burak Bulut]  
Will I turn back?  
Tender sidewalks are my home  
I can’t write about being without you; if you’re leaving, it’s the right time  
This is proof of my love, “My compass isn’t finding me,” it said  
My tongue no longer turns to your lies, your dreams  
Will I turn back?  
Tender sidewalks are my home  
I can’t write about being without you; if you’re leaving, it’s the right time  
This is proof of my love, “My compass isn’t finding me,” it said  
My tongue no longer turns to your lies, your dreams
