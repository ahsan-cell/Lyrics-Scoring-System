**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: UZI]**  
(Yeah, Jaygo)  
(R4DIANT)  
(Yeah, Etki on the track)  

**[Chorus: UZI]**  
I stopped the taxi, taxi, said "Step on it"  
So I won't get stuck, stuck, not for me  
Don't keep me waiting at this hour, I'll set up for you, bro  
With ice around my neck, Fevzi Made It, piggy bank  

**[Verse 1: UZI]**  
I didn't play games, I always made money  
Show me a worthy rival (Show me)  
I drew the path to you, just like a mandala  
Money in the safe, I mean in the bank  
Turkish killa, star, crescent  
Original Glock, brings the final act  
My friends are quick, I swear it's legit  
For five years, I've been going viral every day  
Chavo, Killy Milly, narcotics  
International, the trigger drops  
Vests in style, with steel inside  
But come see, there's a hole in the head  
I roamed in misery, not a penny to my name  
I weighed forty-five kilos of pride  
Hearts are cold, faces are scarred  
Let those who do wrong perish, that's the game  

**[Bridge: UZI]**  
Still a gang (Mhm, mhm)  
Not over yet, let's keep talking (Mhm, hmm)  
Ladies admire the courage  
Dad, always stays sober, always a man (Eh)  
Still a gang (Still a gang)  
Not over yet, let's keep talking (Mhm, hmm)  
Ladies admire the courage  
Dad, always stays sober, always a man (Yeah, yeah)  

**[Verse 2: Russ Millions]**  
I'm rich and fucking legit  
Would've dealt with that prick but he's getting me nicked (Bullet)  
Love ten times, so I fill up his clip  
You know, the gang stays bad and we're lit (Lit)  
Taking trips, I'll be back in a bit (Haha)  
The girl’s too thick, wants to ride me  
Convoy, of course, there's a gun in the whip  
Make a man sit down like he’s taking a shit (Shotta)  
I got a buzz like a beehive  
Gunshots smoke enemies like a .35  
You know I got brodie if he needs a line  
Need a break quickly, fly to Dubai  
Grab my ten K, bring down the Fit Five  
Make her fall in love, make her get shy (Wha?)  
I fuck two sisters, I'm a sick guy (Wha? Wha?)  
Start to overthink when I get high (Shotta)  
I love Stefflon Don, I wanna beat her (Uh-huh)  
I see myself spoiling Shenseea (Uh-huh, mhm)  
Scientists got a thing for Maria  
Most of the time, I still got a crush on Aaliyah  
Good turn the Salah, hot girl, Zara  
Got my thing harder, hee-hee, ha-ha  
(Good turn the Salah, hot girl, Zara  
Got my thing harder, hee-hee, ha-ha)  
I got a sexy Brazilian  
Only one for a man Russ Million  
One of a kind, so there ain't no equivalent  
Christian, but she ain't so innocent  
Of course, she knows that my thing's different (Yeah)  
When it’s on, I'm a real participant (Yeah)  
With the killers moving militant (Yeah)  
Evil eye 'cause man stays diligent (Shotta)  

**[Chorus: UZI]**  
I stopped the taxi, taxi, said "Step on it"  
So I won't get stuck, stuck, not for me  
Don't keep me waiting at this hour, I'll set up for you, bro  
With ice around my neck, Fevzi Made It, piggy bank
