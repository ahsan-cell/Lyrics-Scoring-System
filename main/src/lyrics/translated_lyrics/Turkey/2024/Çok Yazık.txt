**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  

[Verse 1]  
Running away, I find it was always myself  
Every part of me, thought to be unhurt, carries great sorrow  
Maybe unexpectedly, maybe when least expected  
A hug could make it all go away  

[Chorus]  
My paths are thorny and rocky in my hands  
Your photo wears the same smile on its face  
I didn’t ask why our end came to this, what a shame  
My arms turned your home yellow in the sky  
If my star cries, it will fall into your hands  
I wasn’t afraid to face your darkness, I shone  
My paths are thorny and rocky in my hands  
Your photo wears the same smile on its face  
I didn’t ask why our end came to this, what a shame  
My arms turned your home yellow in the sky  
If my star cries, it will fall into your hands  
I wasn’t afraid to face your darkness, I shone  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  

[Verse 2]  
Everything seemed fine, so why this loneliness?  
Maybe you had to leave, but it’s worth more than this world  
Maybe passing by, maybe while on the way  
Just a single visit would be enough  

[Chorus]  
My paths are thorny and rocky in my hands  
Your photo wears the same smile on its face  
I didn’t ask why our end came to this, what a shame  
My arms turned your home yellow in the sky  
If my star cries, it will fall into your hands  
I wasn’t afraid to face your darkness, I shone  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
