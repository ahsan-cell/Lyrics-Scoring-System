**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
I go out at night, I get all freaky  
Come closer, daddy, I’m feeling flirty  
I take shots, pouring rum on my chest  
I’ve got some haters who can’t keep up with the rest  
The beast has arrived, don’t cry  
They’re the best, these bitches are high  
Lighting up the city all night  
I’m a motorcycle and they’re city bikes (Grah, grah)  

**[Verse 1]**  
Forget all those bitches, I’ve got the blicky in my purse  
Suck on my clit, give me a hickey  
I’m LuLu, my body’s like Nicki  
When I walk by, your man wants to lick me  
I want a gangster who’s like Fifty  
Those who spend cash make me feel freaky  
Pull out a stack to get me litty  
I’m a gangster, I don’t like silly, really  
My diamonds shine, I’m fancy  
After a party, I feel fantastic  
I’m pretty, with a mischievous mind  
I grew up with my brothers, they’re gangsters  
I’m good at spotting fakes, one wrong move and you’re gone in an instant (Grah)  
I put on gloves, if I get caught, I’ll take down the commander (Forget it)  
Forget it, I’ve got weed smoking all night, I won’t sleep  
I’m off with my bitches to another country  
Long live the party, the shots are on me (Grah)  
None of my bitches are easy, they’re in the Lamb shaking ass in the backseat  
I like it when they’re lazy  
At the end of the night, we end up getting nasty  

**[Chorus]**  
I go out at night, I get all freaky  
Come closer, daddy, I’m feeling flirty  
I take shots, pouring rum on my chest  
I’ve got some haters who can’t keep up with the rest  
The beast has arrived, don’t cry  
They’re the best, these bitches are high  
Lighting up the city all night  
I’m a motorcycle and they’re city bikes (Grah, grah)  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’ve got diamonds on my choker  
I don’t wear it because I have stalkers  
I’m like an iPhone, I light up with your touch  
This pussy’s tight like a locker  
I’m Harley Quinn and you’re Joker  
My heart’s cold, it’s frozen  
Give me privacy in all the poses  
Get me wet like you don’t know  
Open me up like Moses did (Moses)  
Treat me special, take me traveling  
Flirting at night, with a view of the sea  
It was so good, I tattooed his initial  
Blessed be the mother, she taught him well  
If he’s the bandit, I’m the criminal  
You come, I come, we’re going to steal (Ah)  
We’re going to steal (Ah-ah!), hey  

**[Chorus]**  
I go out at night, I get all freaky  
Come closer, daddy, I’m feeling flirty  
I take shots, pouring rum on my chest  
I’ve got some haters who can’t keep up with the rest  
The beast has arrived, don’t cry  
They’re the best, these bitches are high  
Lighting up the city all night  
I’m a motorcycle and they’re city bikes (Grah, grah)  

**[Outro]**  
(Pium, pium)  
(La Malu, ah)  
(Eh)  
(And if your boyfriend doesn’t eat you out, eh, what?)  
(Then he shouldn’t be doing that, okay, okay)  
(Hahaha)
