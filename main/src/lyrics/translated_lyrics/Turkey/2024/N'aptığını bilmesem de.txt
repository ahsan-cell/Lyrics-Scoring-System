**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Noble)  
(Narco)  
Yeah  
Even if I don't know what you're doing  
I want you to stay, even if I keep saying "Go"  
I value you so much, baby  
Even if I don't show it, oh  

[Chorus]  
Even if I don't know what you're doing  
I want you to stay, even if I keep saying "Go"  
I value you so much, baby (Baby)  
Even if I don't show it, oh  
Even if I don't know what you're doing  
I want you to stay, even if I keep saying "Go"  
I value you so much, baby (Baby)  
Even if I don't show it, oh  

[Verse]  
Close your eyes, don’t see me when you’re helpless  
Say your lies to my face one last time  
I have just one wish from God (Ah)  
Don’t die without living what you made me live  
I’m not like you, I’ve always competed with myself  
Years have passed, and I got used to this  
While I was saying, "My life is completely upside down"  
Then I met a girl  

[Bridge]  
Baby, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Baby, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Don’t come anymore, even if I say "Come"  
Even if I lock myself in rooms  
It’s not easy to forget you, baby  
Don’t smile so beautifully, oh  

[Chorus]  
Even if I don't know what you're doing  
I want you to stay, even if I keep saying "Go" (Ah)  
I value you so much, baby  
Even if I don't show it, oh  
Even if I don't know what you're doing (Ah)  
I want you to stay, even if I keep saying "Go"  
I value you so much, baby (Ah)  
Even if I don't show it, oh  

[Outro]  
Ah, ah  
(A-A-Alo, Waxy?)  
Ah, ah
