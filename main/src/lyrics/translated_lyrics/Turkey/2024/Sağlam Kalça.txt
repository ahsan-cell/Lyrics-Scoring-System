**[Intro]**  
(R-R-Rex cooking up art)

**[Chorus]**  
Curvy hips, a face like a baby  
Oh my God, it feels like magic  
A devil's feather around your neck, a unique piece  
Come sleep with me tonight  
"What's their vibe like?" don’t you wonder  
The ending will be so beautiful—  
Curvy hips, a face like a baby  
Oh my God, it feels like magic  
A devil's feather around your neck, a unique piece  
Come sleep with me tonight  
"What's their vibe like?" don’t you wonder  
The ending will be so beautiful.

**[Verse]**  
Yeah baby, look, I’ve got my claim  
"They didn’t cut it before," they said  
You haven’t seen anything yet, oh what bad luck  
35 license plate, brothers with brave hearts  
Baby, loyal to the plan, honestly, you’re the most needed  
We’re already high, baby, my mind’s in space  
This time I won’t fall for the trap, police are around  
Our end is the same, I’m dressed designer  
Did you get a taste? How will you stay apart?

**[Bridge]**  
We’re high, baby, my mind’s in space  
This time I won’t fall for the trap, police are around  
We-we-we’re high, baby, my mind’s in space  
We-we-we’re high, baby, my mind’s in space.

**[Chorus]**  
Curvy hips, a face like a baby  
Oh my God, it feels like magic  
A devil's feather around your neck, a unique piece  
Come sleep with me tonight  
"What's their vibe like?" don’t you wonder  
The ending will be so beautiful—  
Curvy hips, a face like a baby  
Oh my God, it feels like magic  
A devil's feather around your neck, a unique piece  
Come sleep with me tonight  
"What's their vibe like?" don’t you wonder  
The ending will be so beautiful.
