**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Once upon a time, did you love?  
Were there days when you knew love?  
Did you give me roses,  
And sweet melodies become real?  
Once upon a time, did you love?  
Were there days when you knew love?  
Did you give me roses,  
And sweet melodies become the season?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Did you ever hold a grudge against my face?  
Take offense at every beautiful thing?  
Be remembered as broken and unhappy?  
If it’s fate, I’ve erased it long ago.  
If you come after me, if you resist for love,  
If you think about where it went wrong,  
Maybe one day you’ll find it,  
But you’ll forget that too.  
Forget it, forget it.

[Chorus]  
Our story is wounded from the heart,  
Even if I erase what remains of my fate, it doesn’t go away.  
All our distance is just two conversations apart,  
I came, but you don’t understand.  
Our story is wounded from the heart,  
Even if I erase what remains of my fate, it doesn’t go away.  
All our distance is just two conversations apart,  
I loved, but you don’t understand.  

[Verse]

And sweet melodies become real?  
Once upon a time, did you love?  
Were there days when you knew love?  
Did you give me roses,  
And sweet melodies become the season?

All our distance is just two conversations apart,  
I loved, but you don’t understand.
