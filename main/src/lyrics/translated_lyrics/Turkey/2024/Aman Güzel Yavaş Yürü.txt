**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**  
(Where are you, Pango?)

**[Verse 1: Halodayı]**  
Oh, beautiful, walk slowly, but  
You’re so lovely when you smile  
I’m not playing games with you at all  
Call me, we’ll definitely make a plan  
What do you say, is it a first date?  
I don’t know, it could be, oh, oh, maybe  
You’re getting under my skin, of course, you love it  
You should come to me, my baby  
God bless, I’ve said it forty thousand times, ah  
I’ve set up a barricade on your paths  
Neither with me nor for my tomorrows  
We burned, Dad, in the fire of love  
Those who leave, leave, and those who stay, stay, of course  
I didn’t burn this, I didn’t drink anything  
You left without saying a single word  
Be careful, beautiful, don’t fall as you walk

**[Chorus: Azer Bülbül]**  
Oh, beautiful, walk slowly, my dear, my beloved  
You’d hit the stone on the road, what can I say, my beauty?  
You’re such a beauty that, my dear, my beloved  
You’re worth nine brothers, what can I say, my beauty?  
Oh, beautiful, walk slowly, my dear, my beloved  
You’d hit the stone on the road, what can I say, my beauty?  
You’re such a beauty that, my dear, my beloved  
You’re worth nine brothers, what can I say, my beauty? Oh, oh

**[Verse 2: Halodayı]**  
Five people, one car, Azer  
What’s your number, how much money or paper?  
Don’t make a fuss, what’s it worth?  
I’m telling you, walk slowly, mademoiselle  
I haven’t done anything, don’t read the poem  
I’ve never gone to work, my field is special  
I have a couple of words for you, just squat down  
Honestly, you’re worth nine brothers

**[Bridge: Halodayı]**  
A-a-a, where’s my remedy, where’s my remedy?  
Don’t say “make a way for us,” it’s a trouble  
Two eyes, both are my remedy  
Azer Baba, I swear I’m in trouble  
Where’s my remedy, where’s my remedy?  
Don’t say “make a way for us,” it’s a trouble  
Two eyes, both are my remedy  
Azer Baba, I swear I’m in trouble

**[Chorus: Azer Bülbül]**  
Oh, beautiful, walk slowly, my dear, my beloved  
You’d hit the stone on the road, what can I say, my beauty?  
You’re such a beauty that, my dear, my beloved  
You’re worth nine brothers, what can I say, my beauty? Oh, oh

**[Outro: Azer Bülbül]**  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh
