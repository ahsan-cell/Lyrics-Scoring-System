**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**  
(Hey, Chahid)

**[Verse 1: UZI]**  
Yeah  
I burned out, my mind's ablaze, so clear  
I looked back at the past, where are we now?  
We're not at the beginning, we're at the end  
We say "Take care," not "See you later"  
Since you had your excuse from the start,  
Why didn't you act?  
Sometimes you were my friend, sometimes like family,  
Close to my heart  
This world is a witness, even if it burns, I can't say "Come back"  
You want it, but I can't stop it  
I can't even tell you what I wrote for you  
Honestly, I'm sorry, my dear  
I can't speak in flowery phrases  
You know, while the rebels wait  
I can't tell my own killer to "Come back"  
Time has passed

**[Bridge: UZI]**  
Where are you really, my dear?  
(I'm fighting with the bloodless)  
Where are you really, my dear?  
Or forget it, this is fine, my dear  
(Or forget it, this is fine, my dear)  
But really, my heart is burning  
(But really, my heart is burning)  
Where are you really, my dear?  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
Where are you really, my dear?  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
Or forget it, this is fine, my dear  
(Or forget it, this is fine, my dear)

**[Chorus: UZI & Azer Bülbül]**  
In every step I take, there's a trace of you  
In the mirror I look into, I see your face  
In this soul of mine, your eyes are there  
Where are you, my dear?  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
In my heart, there's a pain of you  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
In my life, there's a trace of you  
(Or forget it, this is fine, my dear)  
Where are you, my dear?  
(But really, my heart is burning)  
My heart is burning  
Hey, hey

**[Verse 2: UZI]**  
Where are you really, my dear?  
I'm fighting with the bloodless  
Where are you really, my dear?  
I'm stuck, save me from these voids  
Or forget it, this is fine, my dear  
I'm tired of the shameless ones  
But really, my heart is burning  
I've been hit on my left side all along  
Haven't you ever gotten tired of the fakeness?  
Of fears that define your character  
I saw you through the devil's pupil  
I can't turn back, not because I miss my grudge  
If I die, I'll finish the path I started with you alone  
I won't turn back to you again  
I'm okay with yesterday, it doesn't matter, that's why  
You're no longer on my agenda

**[Chorus: UZI & Azer Bülbül]**  
In every step I take, there's a trace of you  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
In the mirror I look into, I see your face  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
In this soul of mine, your eyes are there  
(But really, my heart is burning)  
Where are you, my dear?  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
In my heart, there's a pain of you  
(Where are you really, my dear?)  
In my life, there's a trace of you  
(Or forget it, this is fine, my dear)  
Where are you, my dear?  
(But really, my heart is burning)  
My heart is burning

**[Outro: Azer Bülbül]**  
In my heart, there's a pain of you  
In my life, there's a trace of you  
Where are you, my dear?  
My heart is burning
