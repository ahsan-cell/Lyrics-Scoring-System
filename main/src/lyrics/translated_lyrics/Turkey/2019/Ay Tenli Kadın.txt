**[Intro]**  
I found you deep within,  
Our roots intertwined, tightly embraced.  
Seeing you, being with you,  
Itâ€™s beautiful, perhaps, but  
Dreaming is something entirely different.

**[Chorus]**  
Your skin has taken the whiteness of the moon,  
The color of your hair comes from the night.  
This love carries into the night,  
As you cover your heart with mine,  
Take my feelings like my thoughts,  
Take them, for I miss you.  
As you cover your heart with mine,  
Take my feelings like my thoughts,  
Take them, for I miss you.

**[Instrumental]**

**[Chorus]**  
Your skin has taken the whiteness of the moon,  
The color of your hair comes from the night.  
This love carries into the night,  
As you cover your heart with mine,  
Take my feelings like my thoughts,  
Take them, for I miss you.  
As you cover your heart with mine,  
Take my feelings like my thoughts,  
Take them, for I miss you.
