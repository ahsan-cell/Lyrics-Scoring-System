**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Haa-ahh  
(Ta-Ta-Ta-Tanerman)  

[Chorus]  
Don't lie, look into my eyes this time (Lie)  
Don't lie, look into my eyes this time (Lie)  
Don't lie, look into my eyes this time  
Look into my eyes this time  
Look into my eyes  
How did I fall for your eyes? (Lie)  
How did I fall for your eyes? (Lie)  
My head spins again because your eyes are hazel  
Your eyes are hazel  
Your eyes are hazel  

[Refrain]  
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me  
You know this boy is always distracted, always distracted, always distracted, always distracted, always distracted  
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me  
You know this boy is always distracted, always distracted, always distracted, always  

[Verse]  
I can't get over you (Ah-ah-ah)  
I'm drunk again, staying up all night (Ah-ah-ah)  
I can't solve the questions in my mind (Ah-ah-ah)  
Is it day or night? I can't see (Pov, pov)  
"Don't say it's all your fault," don't tell me that, I won't accept it  
Go ahead and hit me  
Even if you keep doing this to me, it won't break my pride  
It won't pass  
It consumed my life, it cooks salt on my neck  
Where will I find it?  
I've fallen into this trouble, my end is coming too soon (Too soon)  
If I could take a hit from your lips again  
Forget it, a lifetime is not worth stretching it out (Stretching it)  
You're a bittersweet song in my ears  
Life, I swear I'm tired of falling for its traps  

[Bridge]  
Don't lie, look into my eyes  
Don't lie, look into my eyes  
Don't lie, look into my eyes  
Look into my eyes  
Look into my eyes  

[Chorus]  
Don't lie, look into my eyes this time (Lie)  
Don't lie, look into my eyes this time (Lie)  
Don't lie, look into my eyes this time  
Look into my eyes this time  
Look into my eyes  
How did I fall for your eyes? (Lie)  
How did I fall for your eyes? (Lie)  
My head spins again because your eyes are hazel  
Your eyes are hazel  
Your eyes are hazel  

[Refrain]  
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me  
You know this boy is always distracted, always distracted, always distracted, always distracted, always distracted  
Help me, help me, help me, help me, help me, help me  
You know this boy is always distracted, always distracted, always distracted, always  

[Outro]  
Ooooh  
Aaah-aah  
Ha-aah
