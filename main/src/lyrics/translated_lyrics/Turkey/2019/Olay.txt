**[Intro]**  
Event, event, event, event, event, event, event, event  
Event, event (Artz, what's poppin' my G?)  
Event, event, event, event (B-B-Bugy)  

**[Chorus]**  
Every day a new event, easy to say, Koal, Koal  
Wherever something abnormal happens, it feels normal to me now  
Paranoia, my mind won't give approval  
They say, "Wow, how did you do that?" It just happened easily  
Easy to say, Koal, Koal  
Wherever something abnormal happens, it feels normal to me now  
Paranoia, my mind won't give approval  
They say, "Wow, how did you do that?" We became the event  

**[Back Chorus]**  
Event, event, event, event, event, event, event, event  
Event, event, event, event, event, event, event, event  

**[Verse 1]**  
"All Eyez on Me," all eyes are on me  
Around me, ten thousand people like zombies  
Feeling good, alcohol's flowing  
Berlin, Kotti, Istanbul, Bomonti  
Capital, ODTÜ, Gitto, OSTİM  
My whole world is my neighborhood, the world is a slum  
Are we too high? My mind's the cockpit, everywhere's police  
Everywhere's chaos, every day an event, event, event  
Then let's declare a state of emergency, the public's a guinea pig  
There's no reason not to be a psychopath  
So play and break loose, I have a penny, you have a stack  
Bring out the event, the water from the riot police will squeeze, your work will get wet  
The officer dies, the children die; they live, they come out  
If they wanted, it would end, but don’t think anyone will come out  
Because this brings money, it's an event  
Every day the same news, another rape, harassment  
Gossip wants events, celebrities become the headlines  
Everyone's alone, everyone’s an enemy to someone  
Wherever I look, there's a fight, wherever I go, it's an event  

**[Chorus]**  
Every day a new event, easy to say, Koal, Koal  
Wherever something abnormal happens, it feels normal to me now  
Paranoia, my mind won't give approval  
They say, "Wow, how did you do that?" It just happened easily  
Easy to say, Koal, Koal  
Wherever something abnormal happens, it feels normal to me now  
Paranoia, my mind won't give approval  
They say, "Wow, how did you do that?" We became the event  

**[Back Chorus]**  
Event, event, event, event, event, event, event, event  
Event, event, event, event, event, event, event, event  

**[Verse 2]**  
Flash, flash, paparazzi, like, tweet; virtual world ego  
This is our whole event  
That's why wherever we go, we become the event  
This is our event too  
They want the event to come out between us  
Because it’s useless for them  
Who are we? Where did we come from? Everyone thinks  
Actually, the whole event is euro, lira, and dollar  
Bring out the event, spilling blood is easier than making a deal  
A bullet, a shot, costs less than a flower  
A bomb falls like a fuse and never burns  
On the street with crews, again in the third pages—  

**[Chorus]**  
Event, easy to say, Koal, Koal  
Wherever something abnormal happens, it feels normal to me now  
Paranoia, my mind won't give approval  
They say, "Wow, how did you do that?" It just happened easily  
Easy to say, Koal, Koal  
Wherever something abnormal happens, it feels normal to me now  
Paranoia, my mind won't give approval  
They say, "Wow, how did you do that?" We became the event  

**[Outro]**  
Event, event  
(Regarding encouraging substance use through music—)  
Event, event  
(Um, you were actually incarcerated because of the music you have put out? Now can you please resemble your—)  
Event, event  
(We will talk about a rapper whose songs we actually listen to, regarding developments with Ezhel—)  
Event, event  
Every day a new event
