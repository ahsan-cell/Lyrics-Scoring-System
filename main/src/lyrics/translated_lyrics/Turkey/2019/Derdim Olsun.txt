**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Let it be my pain (Let it be), let the glasses fill (Fill them)  
While I lose, let Azrael just watch  
You’re listening, but you don’t see  
They’ll sacrifice me, who are you hanging out with?

[Verse]  
How many hells have extinguished  
Inside me, I don’t know  
They think I’m crazy  
They’re looking for me  
Is there anyone who sees?

[Pre-Chorus]  
This falling leaf was the dream of my youth  
Writing on paper, my longing is in white  
I’ve made my decision, yet my hands are stained with blood  
God struck the chord, before I reach the grave  
This falling leaf was the dream of my youth  
Writing on paper, my longing is in white  
I’ve made my decision, yet my hands are stained with blood  
God struck the chord, before I reach the grave

[Chorus]  
Let it be my pain (Let it be), let the glasses fill (Fill them)  
While I lose, let Azrael just watch  
You’re listening, but you don’t see  
They’ll sacrifice me, who are you hanging out with?

[Verse]  
How many hells have extinguished  
Inside me, I don’t know  
They think I’m crazy  
They’re looking for me  
Is there anyone who sees?

[Pre-Chorus]  
This falling leaf was the dream of my youth  
Writing on paper, my longing is in white  
I’ve made my decision, yet my hands are stained with blood  
God struck the chord, before I reach the grave  
This falling leaf was the dream of my youth  
Writing on paper, my longing is in white  
I’ve made my decision, yet my hands are stained with blood  
God struck the chord, before I reach the grave
