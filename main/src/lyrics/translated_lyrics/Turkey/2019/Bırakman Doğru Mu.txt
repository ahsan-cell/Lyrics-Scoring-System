**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Zeynep Bastık]**  
Tell me, have hopes faded again?  
Did we get lost like promises made in drunkenness?  
Tell me, did anyone truly love?  
Is it right for you to let go while holding my hands tight?

**[Verse 1: Anıl Piyancı]**  
Speak up, don’t hesitate to talk to me  
In fact, fill me with your breath  
Look into my eyes and touch the madness inside me  
Because if we can’t talk, life becomes a torment  
Never keep your distance from us  
Don’t waste your tears, don’t set traps for me  
Don’t put us in this situation, blocking our path  
I don’t care if you ruin my pride, believe me  
I’ve never lost my faith  
When I hold your hands, I say, “We should dance”  
Maybe I should dedicate my whole life to you  
I can never give you up, forgive me, baby

**[Bridge: Anıl Piyancı]**  
Come, leave your bad memories behind  
Embrace me and feel me again  
You believe in love, think of your new memories  
Feelings that aren’t spoken are lies

**[Chorus: Zeynep Bastık]**  
Tell me, have hopes faded again?  
Did we get lost like promises made in drunkenness?  
Tell me, did anyone truly love?  
Is it right for you to let go while holding my hands tight?

**[Back Chorus: Zeynep Bastık]**  
My heart keeps falling into memories  
My mind lingers, unable to grasp the pain  
Nights cling to me again  
Will you laugh like a child?  
As if happy in lies  
It doesn’t heal anymore, look at my wound

**[Verse 2: Anıl Piyancı]**  
Hold my hands tight, don’t let go  
We both must pass this test  
Living brings trauma to everyone  
Thinking of your absence makes my heart stop  
It stops, saying “Stop, fool”  
Life calls out after me  
Composing lies like a new song  
Still, don’t lose hope, it says, hold on  
This love is like a miracle, like lightning  
Yes, it’s true, this guy was a madman  
And you were my luck, like a kind of charm  
You were like the brightest star shining in the sky

**[Bridge: Anıl Piyancı]**  
Come, leave your bad memories behind  
Embrace me and feel me again  
You believe in love, think of your new memories  
Feelings that aren’t spoken are lies

**[Chorus: Zeynep Bastık]**  
Tell me, have hopes faded again?  
Did we get lost like promises made in drunkenness?  
Tell me, did anyone truly love?  
Is it right for you to let go while holding my hands tight?

**[Back Chorus: Zeynep Bastık]**  
My heart keeps falling into memories  
My mind lingers, unable to grasp the pain  
Nights cling to me again  
Will you laugh like a child?  
As if happy in lies  
It doesn’t heal anymore, look at my wound

**[Chorus: Zeynep Bastık]**  
Tell me, have hopes faded again?  
Did we get lost like promises made in drunkenness?  
Tell me, did anyone truly love?  
Is it right for you to let go while holding my hands tight?  

**[Outro: Zeynep Bastık]**  
Is it right for you to let go?  
Is it right for you to let go?  
Is it right for you to let go?  
Is it right for you to let go?  
Is it right for you to let go?  
Is it right for you to let go?
