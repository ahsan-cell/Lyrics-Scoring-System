**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Hold my hand, let’s leave this place  
Listen to me just once, don’t say it’s impossible  
My wind has died down, my fire has gone out  
Oh, baby, I’m still crazy

[Chorus]  
When you’re not here, there’s neither night nor day  
No moon, not a single star in sight  
Everywhere is dark and desolate  
I can’t see anything  
When you’re not here, there’s neither night nor day  
No moon, not a single star in sight  
Everywhere is dark and desolate  
I can’t see anything

[Verse]  
Hold my hand, let’s leave this place  
Listen to me just once, don’t say it’s impossible  
My wind has died down, my fire has gone out  
Oh, baby, I’m still crazy

[Chorus]  
When you’re not here, there’s neither night nor day  
No moon, not a single star in sight  
Everywhere is dark and desolate  
I can’t see anything  
When you’re not here, there’s neither night nor day  
No moon, not a single star in sight  
Everywhere is dark and desolate  
I can’t see anything
