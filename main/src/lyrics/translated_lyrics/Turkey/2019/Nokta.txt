**Translated Lyrics:**

Someone come and take me away  
Tear me from the place where I hid you  
I might not pass this test easily  
But still, I need to choose a path  
I'm indecisive, I'm inconsistent  

**[Bridge]**  
How long will it take?  
How long will my heart challenge my mind?  
I think you were the only one  
Who would scatter me, my end will be you  

I'm a period in a story that’s no longer read  

**[Chorus] (x2)**  
Does it come to your mind?  
It hurts now and then  
For me, yesterday hasn’t passed yet  
Do you remember us? Well, is there any trace left?  
Do you lower the volume every time our song plays?  

**[Verse]**  
Someone come and take me away  
Tear me from the place where I hid you  
I might not pass this test easily  
But still, I need to choose a path  
I'm indecisive, I'm inconsistent  

**[Bridge]**  
How long will it take?  
How long will my heart challenge my mind?  
I think you were the only one  
Who would scatter me, my end will be you  

I'm a period in a story that’s no longer read  

**[Chorus] (x3)**  
Does it come to your mind?  
It hurts now and then  
For me, yesterday hasn’t passed yet  
Do you remember us? Well, is there any trace left?  
Do you lower the volume every time our song plays?
