**[Intro]**  
(B-B-Bugy)  
Na-na-na-na-na-na, hah-hah-hah  
Nights, oh nights,  
Nights, ah  

**[Verse 1]**  
Red brake, red beer (Red beer)  
A mix of the greedy and the thieves in between  
I’ve broken down while losing my mind (Losing my mind)  
"Gencebay says nights are harsher than days" (Says Gencebay)  
At night, there’s both trouble and work, and fun  
My feelings are tangled, I wake from my dreams  
Is it insomnia? That’s what makes the night, in my opinion  
I hang out in the corners of my city  
Everywhere, different-tempered women, grumpy men, aimless steps  
I wander through the satellites of my brain  
Open your ears and hear this from me  
The previous hour, ganja and paper  
All night tight, ready  
I still have unfinished business tonight  
Your city is wrapped in isolation, look  
Make a joke to yourself, drink too much, remember the past  
I have nothing in my hands because there’s nothing at all  
From the darkness, light is born  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
With the effect of the weed, the light shines brighter, breaths are drawn  
From the dark, my path, direction, stars, and sounds  
The moon is more beautiful than the sun  

**[Chorus]**  
Nights, nights (—s)  
While my mind is chasing, I live whatever I am  
Nights, nights (—s)  
I don’t want tomorrow to come; let it be, let the nights fill again  
Nights, nights (—s)  
While my mind is chasing, I live whatever I am  
Nights, nights (—s)  
I don’t want tomorrow to come; let it be, let the nights fill again  

**[Verse 2]**  
I’m angry, I’m angry again (Angry again)  
I’m ambitious, the things I’ve lost still linger in my mind (In my mind)  
On a bar stool, at the age Tupac died  
The cycle of depression begins, tears you shed in despair  
Nights are the essence of it all, babies roam, every city has its idol  
"Ezhel, if living is the issue, why run away from it?"  
Living is like extravagance, living is searching for something  
Searching, fighting to achieve  
Success ends in your mind, it can’t be told by writing  
Nights are beyond comprehension  
I become a bat, I turn into a full vampire  
I do bungee jumping into twilight  
My night is blacker, better  
What could rap be, when it’s always the background music of my life? (Always)  
I’m in the nights until my last day (Day)  
The night watchman Ezhel will always meet the last day (Always)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
With the effect of the weed, the light shines brighter, breaths are drawn  
From the dark, my path, direction, stars, and sounds  
The moon is more beautiful than the sun  

**[Chorus]**  
Nights, nights (—s)  
While my mind is chasing, I live whatever I am  
Nights, nights (—s)  
I don’t want tomorrow to come; let it be, let the nights fill again  
Nights, nights (—s, nights)  
While my mind is chasing, I live whatever I am  
Nights, nights (—s)  
I don’t want tomorrow to come (Let it be), let the nights fill again
