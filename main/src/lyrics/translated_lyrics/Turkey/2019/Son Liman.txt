**Translated Lyrics:**

They take away from this heart  
Some thoughts that distract the mind  
They completely fade away  

I haven't touched what you left behind  
I never let it weigh on my breath  
The things that crossed my mind, one by one  
I never read them to your face  

Cry, let the words spill from your heart  
There's not even a promise for you  
Begging and pleading in this body is so hard  
I’m no longer affected  

The sea will surely swell and calm  
It's so hard to move forward with you  
For those with broken hearts  
Then this harbor is the end  

I haven't touched what you left behind  
I never let it weigh on my breath  
The things that crossed my mind, one by one  
I never read them to your face  

Cry, let the words spill from your heart  
There's not even a promise for you  
Begging and pleading in this body is so hard  
I’m no longer affected  

The sea will surely swell and calm  
It's so hard to move forward with you  
For those with broken hearts  
Then this harbor is the end
