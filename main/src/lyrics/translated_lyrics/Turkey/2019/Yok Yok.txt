**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
This love can't fit in a single heart, you know, it's a lifetime  
Farewell to my heart, come find me  
My lies, my mistakes have become a burden  
I've lost myself in the dark of night  
My sins, my weaknesses are everywhere, and you're not here  
One side of me is happy, but the other side is always missing you  
There's no remedy for this state of mine, a wanderer under the moonlight  
I keep singing my song, hoping maybe you'll hear it  
Oh, oh, oh  

[Chorus]  
I'm angry, my hair's a mess, I'm a little sad  
It's the same again, I woke up without you  
Your scent used to be trapped on my skin, but it doesn't matter anymore  
But no, no, no, no, no  
It doesn't matter, no, no, no, no, no  
But no, no, no, no, no  
I'm angry, my hair's a mess, I'm a little sad  
It's the same again, I woke up without you  
Your scent used to be trapped on my skin, but it doesn't matter anymore  
But no, no, no, no, no  
It doesn't matter, no, no, no, no, no  
But no, no, no, no, no  
It doesn't matter, no, no, no  

[Verse]  
This love can't fit in a single heart, you know, it's a lifetime  
Farewell to my heart, come find me  

[Chorus]  
I'm angry, my hair's a mess, I'm a little sad  
It's the same again, I woke up without you  
Your scent used to be trapped on my skin, but it doesn't matter anymore  
But no, no, no, no, no  
It doesn't matter, no, no, no, no, no  
But no, no, no, no, no  
It doesn't matter, no, no, no  

[Outro]  
What else could this be if not love?  
If this isn't love, then what is it?  
What else could this be if not love?  
I'm angry, my hair's a mess, I'm a little sad  
It's the same again, I woke up without you  
It doesn't matter, no, no, no
