**Translated Lyrics:**

My tears are dry, look, this is the final stop  
I've gotten off, I'm walking  
You wasted and threw us away, you sold us out  
I can't believe it  
What kind of lie is this?  
Did I really nurture a snake in my bosom?  
So you thought death was a joke, huh?  
I never laugh  

No one else can cut me off from you  
Only I can, whoever you want, hit, take out, gather  
You'll be playing the regrets later  
With a ceremony, you'll return to the motherland that day  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm burning, I'm burning, counting, I'm cursing  
I have an endless account  
I'm coming to collect  
I'm burning, I'm burning, I know there's a chance  
That means dying for you  
I don't think it's worth it at all  

**[Verse]**  
My tears are dry, look, this is the final stop  
I've gotten off, I'm walking  
You wasted and threw us away, you sold us out  
I can't believe it  
No one else can cut me off from you  
Only I can, whoever you want, hit, take out, gather  
You'll be playing the regrets later  
With a ceremony, you'll return to the motherland that day  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm burning, I'm burning, counting, I'm cursing  
I have an endless account  
I'm coming to collect  
I'm burning, I'm burning, I know there's a chance  
That means dying for you  
I don't think it's worth it at all  

**[Chorus]**  
I'm burning, I'm burning, counting, I'm cursing  
I have an endless account  
I'm coming to collect  
I'm burning, I'm burning, I know there's a chance  
That means dying for you  
I don't think it's worth it at all
