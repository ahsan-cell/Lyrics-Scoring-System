**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It happened once, my heart aligned with you  
No matter what you say, I won't give up now  
Come to me, come to me (To me)  
There's a passion inside me, always a fantasy  
When I look, I see life with you  
Come to me, come to me (To me)  

[Pre-Chorus]  
As if they wrote my fate in your storm  
Wrapped it in your wind and let it go  
Look, I can't escape this love  
Just ask, who does this heart listen to?  

[Chorus]  
Let it flow, let it play if it plays  
All songs should be ashamed of this love  
Come to me, come to me (To me)  
Let it shake, let it burn if it burns  
All flames should be ashamed of this love  
You come to me (To me, to me), come to me (To me, to me)  

[Post-Chorus]  
(Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?)  
Come to me (Come to me)  

[Verse 2]  
First, just stop, relax  
From now on, no one can hurt you  
Take a breath again  
No one can solve you again  
Just stay there, relax  
From now on, no one can hurt you  
Take a breath again  
No one can solve you again  

[Pre-Chorus]  
As if they wrote my fate in your storm  
Wrapped it in your wind and tossed it away  
Look, I can't escape this love  
Just ask, who does this heart listen to?  

[Chorus]  
Let it flow, let it play if it plays  
All songs should be ashamed of this love  
Come to me, come to me (To me)  
Let it shake, let it burn if it burns  
All flames should be ashamed of this love  
You come to me (To me, to me), come to me (Come to me)  

[Post-Chorus]  
(Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?)  
Come to me  

[Bridge]  
[?]  

[Chorus]  
Let it shake, let it burn if it burns  
All flames should be ashamed of this love  
You come to me (To me), come to me  
All flames should be ashamed  
Let it burn, let it burn  
Let the songs play  
Let it be ashamed (Come to me), let it be ashamed (Come to me)  

[Outro]  
(Who cares? Who cares? Who cares?)
