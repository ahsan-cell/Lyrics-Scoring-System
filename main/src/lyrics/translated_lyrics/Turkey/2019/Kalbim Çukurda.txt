**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Cem Adrian]**  
A city stands before you,  
Your memories behind you,  
They corner you in the streets,  
You’ve died at every corner.  
Your name on every crumbling wall,  
Told on the sidewalks,  
They deceive you with a fairytale,  
Your heart remains in the same pit.

**[Verse 1: Gazapizm & Cem Adrian]**  
I’d tear that heart apart if needed (Ha!)  
Never running back, not letting them find me,  
Run here, my breath cut off at a street corner,  
My voice stifled, as if the sea were so near,  
Illusions in my eyes, the charm of reality lost,  
My neighborhood is under surveillance, my home is pressed down (Ah),  
Avoiding me, maybe a tree or a cat,  
I said, "Loyalty is my wealth," they say, "Love is family."  
I have a knife in my pocket, the dirt of your longing in my heart,  
You know, doors that close suddenly never reopen,  
A world in my eyes, every continent blurred,  
(Look) Betrayal surrounds me, lies all around (Ah),  
(Look) This winter hasn’t passed, spring hasn’t come,  
Those towering buildings crashing down on me,  
Smiling before me are hundreds of weaknesses, hope exempt from everything,  
I didn’t turn back, the dirt of the past won’t leave me,  
My eyes blind, my mind always on alert,  
Today, what I want doesn’t happen,  
This unexpected sorrow always sprouts beside me,  
One day all childhoods will end, and the gun will remain at your side.

**[Chorus: Cem Adrian]**  
A city stands before you,  
Your memories behind you,  
They corner you in the streets,  
You’ve died at every corner.  
Your name on every crumbling wall,  
Told on the sidewalks,  
They deceive you with a fairytale,  
Your heart remains in the same pit.

**[Verse 2: Gazapizm & Cem Adrian]**  
My hands are rusty, my hands are thorns (My hands are thorns),  
Your hands are mourning, your hands raised to the sky,  
Why are your hands open?  
To not see the inevitable, I pull the curtain over my eyes,  
But they don’t know, the price has been paid,  
The sun is pregnant with tomorrow (Ah),  
Life turns into something hard to translate,  
Your table is divided, inside it, anxiety fights with ambition,  
Today the sky shines above me,  
Reality fades, doubt rules over your nights,  
Your pillow disappears, the blanket is torn,  
Ah, they don’t see (Ah),  
They don’t know how to smell flowers (Ah, ah),  
They don’t know why I run away,  
They don’t know the fight, they don’t know love,  
Against everything, my song doesn’t end,  
No one hears the applause,  
Everything changes, your identity fades,  
Walls collapse, erasing your name,  
Whose territory is this (He), whose lies are these?  
Today my street gets dirty, everyone is ready and poised for everything,  
They won’t care about the ones who break and fall apart.

**[Chorus: Cem Adrian]**  
A city stands before you,  
Your memories behind you,  
They corner you in the streets,  
You’ve died at every corner.  
Your name on every crumbling wall (Ah),  
Told on the sidewalks,  
They deceive you with a fairytale,  
Your heart remains in the same pit.

**[Outro: Cem Adrian]**  
Ah-ah-ah-ah  
Ah-ah-ah-ah  
Ooh-ooh-ooh
