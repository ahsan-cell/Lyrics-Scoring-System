**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part I]**  
**[Verse 1]**  
I made pancakes in the morning, pancakes  
How nice it turned out, wow, wow  
I wrapped it up and ate it, wrap, wrap  
My mind went blank, just like that, just like that  
Even if everywhere's a mess, a wreck  
I can't sleep on this bed, this mattress  
I stepped outside, turned on the trap  
Now my head's like a firecracker, firecracker  
Oh, yeah, the nights  
Syllables from Cihangir*  
Elite, flashy tourists  
Streets and police  
Let’s spill whiskey and make love  
Natalie says, "I'll take it upfront"  
I said, "Alright, come on, babe"  
We don’t have a bathtub, just a shower cabin  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, yeah, crazy youth  
This is how it goes, Rolex, Range  
Your crew's a bunch of bitches, bitches  
Our crew's rich, rich  
Oh, yeah, crazy youth  
This is how it goes, Rolex, Range  
Your crew's a bunch of bitches, bitches  
Our crew's rich, rich  

**[Verse 2]**  
Baldy, run to your dad  
Trap likes those who do it right  
Hey baby, run, hey baby, get wild  
You’re Windows, I’m Macintosh  
Mandingo, Norm Ender  
My stick’s Dolce  
Someone sitting says, "Purple Cushion"  
My haters are all...  

**[Bridge]**  
Yeah  
Tonight, tonight  
Our heads are feeling good  
We always feel good  
That’s just how we roll  
The police are always on our tail  
Why are the police on our tail?  
Babies, babies  

**[Part II]**  
**[Intro]**  
(You can't resist)  
**[Verse 3]**  
Clinging to popular culture like a slave, but when it comes to talk, Marley, 2Pac  
Of course, a tattoo on your face, hit Auto-Tune on some outdated reggaeton, be Lil Pump  
But they threaten me with my career like Hitler, Elif Cemal from Pozitif  
I won’t bow down, I’ll diss your lineage, drive ethnic fascists crazy  
I don’t care about the losers hanging backstage, constantly sniffing  
And revolutionary youth listen to me, while you pathetic Migos types  
If you want circus monkeys with heads like testicles, "Jungle Laws"  
Then the strong will crush the weak, no sausages or salami for you; just tripe, tripe  

**[Chorus]**  
Hey, hey, let’s see  
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, how should we do it?  
The owner of the place is back  
Let’s take the babies off the track  
Hey, hey, let’s see  
Gucci Gang, Gucci Gang, how should we do it?  
The owner of the place is back  
Let’s take the babies off the track  
Hey, hey, let’s see  
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, how should we do it?  
The owner of the place is back (Get up, man)  
Let’s take the babies off the track  
Hey, hey, let’s see  
Mary Jane, Mary Jane, how should we do it?  
The owner of the place is back  
Let’s take the babies off the track  

**[Outro]**  
Don’t fall asleep saying "freedom"  
Turn up the bass, treble, and volume  
If you’re going to mess with hip-hop  
Run from the police, not from me (Run)  
Hey, hey, hey  
Run from the king  
Hey, hey, hey (For your family)  
Hidididi, hidididi  
Take it, bitch
