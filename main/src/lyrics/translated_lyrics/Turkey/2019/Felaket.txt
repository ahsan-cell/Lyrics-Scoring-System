**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
How did you fit the sun into your smile?  
It spins my heart into the desert  
The rain flowing from your eyes turns deserts into floods  
While storms tear at your hair, my soul still feels the aftermath  
They said, "What is this girl?", I said, "A disaster, a disaster"

[Chorus]  
Disaster, this girl is a calamity, a calamity  
If your gaze touches mine, the apocalypse will break loose, the apocalypse  
You created an earthquake in my world, this troublemaker still shakes  
I've lost my heart again, oh, disaster, disaster

[Verse 2]  
Bombs rain down on this city when we make love  
Strikes hit my soul every time I think of you while drinking substances  
I fall silent to you, I can't speak, I'm hungry, I remain silent to you  
I could never explain you to me, or me to you, so much  
The storms broke loose, the waves drowned me, my lies multiplied  
My tomorrows are buried beneath the lava  
The lightning of your fury struck with all its might  
Neither the grandeur of your longing differs from the abyss  
Nor does hell's comfort come close to you, not even a fraction  
My home, my roof, my window, my door have all flown away from my head  
The sky fell to the ground, the fabric tore apart  
Bad, very bad, both love and curse  
Every moment continues, always, trouble and hardship  

[Chorus]  
Disaster, this girl is a calamity, a calamity  
If your gaze touches mine, the apocalypse will break loose, the apocalypse  
You created an earthquake in my world, this troublemaker still shakes  
I've lost my heart again, oh, disaster, disaster
