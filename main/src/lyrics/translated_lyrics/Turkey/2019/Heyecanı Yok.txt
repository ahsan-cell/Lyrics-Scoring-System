**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
There's not a penny in my coat pocket  
Everyone's jumping, like kangaroos  
My Taunus is fully fueled  
But it still hits us hard, yet there's nothing  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all, none (None, ha)

[Verse 1]  
Win or lose, one of us will fall, there's no escape  
Kid, I sleep too much, no hungry bear playing around  
No one to save you, no one to pull you out  
You have no goal for the future, no tomorrow (Ha)  
No basic trust, no legal or illegal order  
No money bag, don’t wait, there’s no wind blowing  
Everything’s in vain, no plans, look  
In the street you grew up in, there’s no fairytale, ha  
No one to wrap around you, whether alive or dead, no limbo  
There are police in front of my door, a commissioner with a gun  
I’ve got blood stains on my head, huge suitcases in front of me  
They tower over me, the seas are narrow, and I’ve got ticks on my back  
Those songs remain unfinished, there’s no panda here, only camels

[Chorus]  
There's not a penny in my coat pocket (None)  
Everyone's jumping, like kangaroos  
My Taunus is fully fueled (None)  
But it still hits us hard, yet there's nothing  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all, none  
There's not a penny in my coat pocket (None)  
Everyone's jumping, like kangaroos  
My Taunus is fully fueled (None)  
But it still hits us hard, yet there's nothing  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all, none

[Verse 2]  
Now everyone’s aware of the truth, no one is satisfied while eating  
Life is the craziest school, your mind will burn when you’re young  
What’s to come is always essential, depression is destined for the ghetto  
And is everyone stuck in anxiety?  
Moreover, the balance that seizes the joy of living  
And hopes will eventually die, and suddenly everything seems dull  
The closest axis to crime sees, those who live fast die young  
If we burn, they can’t extinguish us, they can’t bring us back  
If something can’t excite us anymore, they can’t kill us either  
Ah, everyone’s gone mad, none of the activities are ethical  
We’ve always been pushed into filth, contradictions have finished us  
We couldn’t know what it was, just wait, what did we drink?  
The city worms have lost all consciousness, restless

[Chorus]  
There's not a penny in my coat pocket (None)  
Everyone's jumping, like kangaroos  
My Taunus is fully fueled  
But it still hits us hard, yet there's nothing  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all, none  
There's not a penny in my coat pocket (None)  
Everyone's jumping, like kangaroos  
My Taunus is fully fueled  
But it still hits us hard, yet there's nothing  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all, none

[Outro]  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all  
(None, none, none, none)  
(None, none, none, none)  
There's not a penny in my coat pocket (None)  
Everyone's jumping, like kangaroos (None)  
(None, none, none, none)  
This life has no thrill, no joy at all (None)
