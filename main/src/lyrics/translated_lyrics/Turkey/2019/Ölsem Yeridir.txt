**Translated Lyrics:**

I still can’t come to myself since last night  
I flew after you, but if I fall, it’s alright  
There’s a feeling inside me that I can’t recognize, believe me  
I think it’s new  
Ah, dying would be fine  

[Chorus]  
I can’t come, I can’t come to you  
I’ll kiss you, I can’t get enough of you  
I reached out, you ran away, I thought I had you  
Even if you say "Come" now  
I can’t come, I can’t come to you  
I’ll kiss you, I can’t get enough of you  

[Verse 2]  
I still can’t solve the dilemma, but I have no questions to ask  
When were you here that you’ve now gone missing?  
One day at dawn, I couldn’t wake up, believe me  
My clock is slow  
Ah, dying would be fine  

[Chorus]  
I can’t come, I can’t come to you  
I’ll kiss you, I can’t get enough of you  
I reached out, you ran away, I thought I had you  
Even if you say "Come" now  
I can’t come, I can’t come to you  
I’ll kiss you, I can’t get enough of you
