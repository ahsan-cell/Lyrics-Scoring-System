**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: BEGE]**  
Hey, hey, yeah  
Again, hey, hey  

**[Verse 1: BEGE]**  
What’s changing? (Woo)  
What’s driving me crazy?  
Or am I the only one always facing a problem alone?  
Come back (Come back)  
Again (Again), again  
But still  

**[Chorus: BEGE]**  
To my right, to my left, it’s uphill but there’s no going back, again, again  
The surroundings are cold, my path is steep, they come empty-handed, they come  
But still  
To my right, to my left, it’s uphill but there’s no going back, again, again  
The surroundings are cold, my path is steep, they come empty-handed, they come  
(But still, but still)  

**[Verse 2: BEGE]**  
Word by word, it fits  
Still, my attitude is quite tough  
Still, you  
Humans don’t care, they always create a trouble  
Always a trouble, take a trouble, let go of a trouble  
The new order weighs on us, but still come  
In my mind, for some, it’s an ocean (Woo)  
Come to the bottom, yeah, come to the very bottom, yeah  
Still come, yeah  
Still come with me, yeah  
Halfway through time (Woo)  
Is this what remains?  
But still  

**[Chorus: BEGE]**  
To my right, to my left, it’s uphill but there’s no going back, again, again  
The surroundings are cold, my path is steep, they come empty-handed, they come (But still)  
To my right, to my left, it’s uphill but there’s no going back, again, again  
The surroundings are cold, my path is steep, they come empty-handed, they come  
(But still, but still)  

**[Outro: Nova Norda, BEGE & Nova Norda & BEGE]**  
Come back again, let’s meet on the bridge, I’ll go crazy  
Come back again, let’s meet on the bridge, I’ll go crazy (Yeah)  
I’ll go crazy (Yeah, yeah), I’ll go crazy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Come back, come back  
Come back, come back, yeah (Yeah, yeah)  
Hmm-mmh
