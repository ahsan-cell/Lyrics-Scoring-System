**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Enduring, every moment enduring  
From zero, Fero hero, bro, boom!  
Before trap, time always passed swaying (Trap)  
Look back, don’t say “I can’t look” (Let’s go)  
It’s not about the number, give a feature to the man  
When Fero steps in, the beats ignite  
My crowd loves me in a subtle way  
Don’t bother, just get lost from here  
I don’t know the bass, treble, or mid  
I pass through syllables, listen to them all  
I choose my target, I have the pins  
I can rise in a day, won’t fall for a lifetime  
My momentum increases, I won’t drop  
My songs echo like a hit in the ears  
The batteries didn’t die suddenly (No, no)  
Get on my train, nigga, don’t be afraid of the iron

[Chorus]  
For my brother (For my brother), for my homies (For my homies)  
For the siblings (Brother, brother), for the big brothers (For the big brothers)  
Not for fame, not for money, for my hip-hop brothers  
This rap is for my brother, trap is for the homies  
For brothers, big brothers, and homies  
Find something equal as a rival  
You know us, our muscles are like that, nigga  
I’m into trap music, it’s a sickness  
A sickness, a sickness  
It’s not just passion or interest, it’s a sickness  
For my mom, my dad, and my lady  
I do this for my brother

[Verse 2]  
Of course for my brother, my neighborhood is rich (Rich)  
If I give up, where’s the bastard, huh? (Bastard, bastard, bastard)  
Both tough and funny, you’re the problem, I’m the money  
I won’t give you five, just get lost (Go)  
They say it’s lyrical quality, I don’t care (Ha)  
Not “Aşık Fero,” but “Fero Nigga,” man (Man)  
Doesn’t understand the subtlety, my tongue and all  
With a snake around my neck, let’s keep going (Go)  
Lamborghini, Gucci, my man Keişan (Bro)  
“Who Is He” is Ronaldinho, I’m Neymar (Goal)  
I’m coming out half, I’m with you, ha (Trap ho use)  
Henny-Henny-Hennessy, my mind’s hazy (Cool)  
I never say to my brother “I came, yeah” (Yeah)  
When I hit, I say “Wow” (Wow, wow, wow, wow)  
Oh dear, oh dear, hey mashallah  
Kei brought joy, believe me, really  
My teachers at school were like “Oh my God”  
Now they’re proud, all of them, goodbye  
A second Fero is hard, let’s hope so  
I’ll represent the neighborhood, God willing  
I love this music, above all, God  
FOREST LAWS, brother, thank you

[Chorus]  
For my brother (For my brother), for my homies (For my homies)  
For the siblings (Brother, brother), for the big brothers (For the big brothers)  
Not for fame, not for money, for my hip-hop brothers  
This rap is for my brother, trap is for the homies  
For brothers, big brothers, and homies  
Find something equal as a rival  
You know us, our muscles are like that, nigga  
I’m into trap music, it’s a sickness  
A sickness, a sickness  
It’s not just passion or interest, it’s a sickness  
For my mom, my dad, and my lady  
I do this for my brother

[Outro]  
For our neighborhood, for our city  
For the listeners and my lovers  
For my forest, for my environment  
I do this for my brother  
I do this for my brother  
I do this for my brother  
I do this for my brother, nigga  
I do this for my brother
