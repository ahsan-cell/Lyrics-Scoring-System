**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Ezhel]  
Oh, KOAL, SLS, yeah  

[Part 1: Ezhel]  
Do whatever you want, do whatever you want  
It's all in vain, just look at you  
Just look at us, this street burned and threw us away  
Do whatever you want, do whatever you want (Do whatever you want)  
Middle-East convoy, make your dreams come true  
Berlin, Ankara, Istanbul  
Money in euros, lira, they weigh on my mind like Indica  
They say I can't stay calm, Dicka  
Even if it ends, everyone says "one more time"  
My mind's always good, always, immer (always, in German)  
Zero six, forty-four, Kızılay, Neukölln  
Our fate is ungrateful, our luck is generous  
Light your fire and extinguish the darkness  
So fill up whatever there is, because there's no last round (Hehe)  

[Hook: Yung Kafa & Gringo]  
Steer the yacht on the Bosporus (On the Bosporus)  
Thirty degrees, we're in the sunshine (Sunshine)  
Tonight on the Bosporus (On the Bosporus)  
On the ocean, I'm at home, it's the summer of my life (Kafa, oh-oh)  

[Part 2: Yung Kafa]  
Time is frozen, my head's beautiful (Yeah)  
Dance with me, Mademoiselle (Aha)  
Your perfume is Coco Chanel (Uhu)  
You made me sweat (Fendo)  
Finally on top, on the top (Aha)  
Everyone's looking totally shocked (Uhu)  
I make money 'round the clock  
Chains are made of ivory  
What’s too little? Give me more  
Running in, completely Dior  
Sometimes I dream of a place  
Wake up and I'm there (Fendi)  
From Berlin to Istanbul (Kafa)  
Like a Turkish Airlines flight (Aah)  
Gringo Abi, take a train  
Ezhel, Cano, we’re cool  

[Hook: Yung Kafa & Yung Kafa & Gringo]  
Steer the yacht on the Bosporus (On the Bosporus)  
Thirty degrees, we're in the sunshine (Sunshine)  
Tonight on the Bosporus (On the Bosporus)  
On the ocean, I'm at home, it's the summer of my life  

[Part 3: Gringo]  
Smokebox, Porsche GTS  
Business lounge, private jet  
Bose sound, Jackson, I'm bad  
Haze check, check, dreams in my head  
Hey son, stop, don’t stress  
Right, left, uppercut-jab, psst, hey, psst, Ariel  
Caribbean queen, tropical  
Ready tonight, Gringo, Mr. Nice Guy  
Your lifestyle, baby, you're so hot  
Swipe-up, Instagram timeline  
Roll one or two joints, want to be alone  
Radio vibes, Gringo fly, I'm high  
Tell me peep, she wants weed, love you  

[Bridge: Küçük Efendi]  
Kiss my hand, hand (Yeah)  
I'm lying on the sandy beach (Fendo)  
Left, right, a diamond, -mant  
I dock at the bank (Uh)  
My submarine has no radar (No)  
Start the turbine, we're heading to Qatar (Yeah)  

[Hook: Yung Kafa]  
Steer the yacht on the Bosporus (On the Bosporus, Fendi)  
Thirty degrees, we're in the sunshine (Sunshine, Gringo)  
Tonight on the Bosporus (On the Bosporus, Kafa)  
On the ocean, I'm at home, it's the summer of my life (Ohoo)
