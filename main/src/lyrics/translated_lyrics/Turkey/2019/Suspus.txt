**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Eyes can't see a thing, it's all fog (Fog, fog, fog, fog)  
They're on my tail, don't make a sound, hush (Hush, hush, hush, hush)  
Once my mind was frozen (My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind)  
When I was on flat ground, my journey was over (My journey, my journey, my journey, my journey)  
Eyes can't see a thing, it's all fog (Fog, fog, fog, fog)  
They're on my tail, don't make a sound, hush (Hush, hush, hush, hush)  
Don't stop, go, unleash your energy (Unleash, unleash, unleash)  
It's already so cold, the surroundings are ice (Ice, ice, ice)  

[Background Chorus]  
Do you ever tell a lie? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  
Do you really listen to troubles? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  
Or do you eat stale things? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  
Do you choose people? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  

[Verse 1]  
If you watch closely, you'll understand, Megatron is right  
I have Ghillie, Kevlar, Mythril, you just have a plain layer of chrome  
I'm already unique, what if I walk around naked? Every day is a decathlon  
There's always barbed wire around me  
I'm alone every day, ask me  
Always on edge, come and see  
Stuck, look, in every form  
I've been left among the crumbs, let it be named now  
Come on, be my hostess, it's hard to find me on every street  
Are you one of those who gets bored or one of those who struggles?  
You're among those who listen to cheap music  
But sorry, there's nothing to be done  
I'm not the fast talker, you're the slow listeners  
If I spoke slowly, you'd think I'd understand, look at this, fool  
With a diaper underneath, here's your test, two times two equals "Punishment" clear  
With your savings, you can't even fill a glass, did you learn that, kid?  
Rap is a movement and it's political  
If you can't digest this, then f*** off  
On the wall, a hit list, most of you are misfits  
I blacken everywhere, you still hit this  
If you don't know, shut up, rub salt in the wounds with your feet  
Set traps for everyone, look, from afar a headshot, already  

[Chorus]  
Eyes can't see a thing, it's all fog (Fog, fog, fog, fog)  
They're on my tail, don't make a sound, hush (Hush, hush, hush, hush)  
Once my mind was frozen (My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind)  
When I was on flat ground, my journey was over (My journey, my journey, my journey, my journey)  
Eyes can't see a thing, it's all fog (Fog, fog, fog, fog)  
They're on my tail, don't make a sound, hush (Hush, hush, hush, hush)  
Don't stop, go, unleash your energy (Unleash, unleash, unleash)  
It's already so cold, the surroundings are ice (Ice, ice, ice)  

[Background Chorus]  
Do you ever tell a lie? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  
Do you really listen to troubles? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  
Or do you eat stale things? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  
Do you choose people? A-ah (A-ah, a-ah)  

[Verse 2]  
Mic-mic-mic-mic-mic-mic-mic-microphone and I've lost myself (Ha)  
Hope the dream I saw is good (Hm)  
I'm the captain, look, many have strayed  
Chase them out the door, sneak in through the window  
You're a firecracker, I'm a bomb (Hop)  
Get up, let's go, fill the tank, boy  
And cut the chat, come on cowboy  
Rap didn't love you, wasn't enough for the chatter (Oh)  
The middlemen manage  
Some dark elements have emerged  
New heads, dark elements will guide you all  
Barricades on the road, new sets  
New dams and new sounds  
New characters and new types  
New fans and new beats  
No turning back, this locks us in  
What shall we do now, I don't know  
Wait, wait, hold on, I'm here, don't worry  
I taught those messing with me retail rap Pantomime (Ha)  
Everyone's tired, partly look (Ha)  
The left flank never runs out of
