**[Intro]**  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
(Beat by Furkan, digga)  

**[Chorus]**  
The sky's overcast but let’s roll,  
I got in the car, let’s go,  
Of course, on the radio, it’s Demet Akalın again,  
You never played us once, my man.  
The sky's overcast (Cold) but let’s roll (Yes),  
I got in the car, let’s go (Skrrt),  
Of course, on the radio, it’s Demet Akalın ("Basket"),  
You never played us once, my man (No).  

**[Verse 1]**  
Yo, play it, play us (Play), just play us once,  
"We said 'FOREST LAWS'," DJ brother, pick and choose,  
A bit of honey, cinnamon, ginger, or turmeric,  
In fast nights, our nickname is "Black Rhino" (Brrs).  
Don’t take a break, keep playing those songs,  
The current's out again, bro, Güzelbahçe "Karbala" (Karbala).  
Yeah, alright, it’s here, I wrote it down instantly,  
They didn’t play us on the radio because we’re black (Play, man).  
I won’t stay silent, keep going (Go), everyone’s bleeding (Blood),  
If they saw me, they’d say "Respect," like Nelson Mandela (Boss).  
My verse is sweet like sugar, chocolate, jam (Yum),  
One bite won’t break you, come on, eat, see.  

**[Chorus]**  
The sky's overcast (Cold) but let’s roll (Go),  
I got in the car, let’s go (Skrrt),  
Of course, on the radio, it’s Demet Akalın ("Basket"),  
You never played us once, my man (Nope).  
It sticks in your mind (Yes), I look cool (Fire),  
Tonight’s fast, full of fun (Okay),  
If you catch me, don’t hold back, darling (Fast),  
Let it be deep, I won’t drown, open up, my man (Face).  

**[Verse 2]**  
They always talk back and forth (Back),  
Your words will come back to you (Fero),  
Cool like Belinelli, my blood (My blood),  
Come to me tonight (Darling).  
Come out, come to me, I said, "Today’s chilly,"  
Get close to the fireplace (Oh),  
"It got hot," like Nelly would say (So hot),  
He’ll turn on Eminem on the spot (Oh, fuck).  
"Old school," he said, her name is Mihriban (Mihriban),  
I love a mini bar with Hennessy (Mini bar).  
There’s a new generation in Turkish rap (Skrrt-skrrt),  
She said, "Make it big, I don’t like minimal" (One),  
I said, "Respect to you, how polite is this girl?" (Bitch).  
We’ll get out, this job is about reputation (Not),  
We’ll play Kuku, SLS is a compliment (Artz).  
She said, "Save me, check the SMS" (Look),  
I said, "I’ll look, you’ll always wrap around me" (No way).  
I told my brother, "Save me, Berkcan" (BEGE),  
He came and picked me up, in the background "Derman" (For love).  
Shout out to Angara, my brother is Sercan.  

**[Chorus]**  
The sky's overcast (Cold) but let’s roll (Go),  
I got in the car, let’s go (Skrrt),  
Of course, on the radio, it’s Demet Akalın ("Basket"),  
You never played us once, my man (Nope).  
It sticks in your mind (Yes), I look cool (Fire),  
Tonight’s fast, full of fun (Okay),  
If you catch me, don’t hold back, darling (Fast),  
Let it be deep, I won’t drown, open up, my man (Face).
