**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Who will freeze this moment for us?  
It can't get any better than this  
Think of the days that lie behind us  
How long we've shared joy and tears  
Here, everyone goes through fire for each other  
In the rain, weâ€™re never alone  
And as long as our hearts guide us  
It will always be this way  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A toast to what lies ahead  
That it brings the best for us  
A toast to what unites us  
To this time (To this time)  

[Chorus]  
A toast to us (Us)  
To this life  
To the moment  
That always remains  
A toast to us (Us)  
To now and forever  
To a day  
Of infinity  

[Verse 2]  
We have wings, we swear eternal loyalty  
We gild this day  
(One Love) A lifetime without regret  
From the first step to the grave  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A toast to what lies ahead  
That it brings the best for us  
A toast to what unites us  
To this time (To this time)  

[Chorus]  
A toast to us (Us)  
To this life (Oh-oh)  
To the moment  
That always remains (Oh-oh)  
A toast to us (Us)  
To now and forever  
To a day  
Of infinity (Infinity)  

[Bridge]  
A fireworks display of endorphins  
A fireworks show lights up the night  
So many lights have remained  
A moment that makes us immortal  
Makes us immortal, uh-uh-uh-uh  
Uh-uh-uh-uh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A toast to what lies ahead  
That it brings the best for us  
A toast to what unites us  
To this time (Oh-oh; to this time)  

[Chorus]  
A toast to us (Us)  
To this life (Oh-oh-oh)  
To the moment  
That always remains (Oh; that always remains, oh-oh)  
A toast to us (A toast to us; us)  
To now and forever  
To a day (To a day)  
Of infinity  

[Outro]  
A toast to us (A fireworks display of endorphins)  
A toast to us (A fireworks show lights up the night)  
A toast to us (So many lights have remained)  
To us
