**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We followed the streets of gold  
Nothing is too far  
Everything happens  
And now we are here  
Shining together  
Everything loud, everything bright  
The sun burns and wakes us up  
Completely unbound  

[Chorus]  
You and I  
We tear the clouds apart  
You and I  
We make the sky blue  
Here we come, and no one can hold us back  
You and I  
A leap into the stratosphere, zooming in on us  
We dance weightlessly  
Everyone floats in the space  
The beat like in a dream  
You and I  
You and I  
You and I  

[Verse 2]  
Nothing passes by  
We bend time  
And all we need  
Is this moment where everything begins  
When we dive into the sound  
Everything loud, everything bright  
The sun burns and wakes us up  
Completely unbound  

[Chorus]  
You and I  
We tear the clouds apart  
You and I  
We make the sky blue  
Here we come, and no one can hold us back  
You and I  
A leap into the stratosphere, zooming in on us  
We dance weightlessly  
Everyone floats in the space  
The beat like in a dream  
You and I  
A leap into the stratosphere, zooming in on us  
We dance weightlessly  
Everyone floats in the space  
The beat like in a dream  
You and I  
You and I  
You and I  
We  
You and I  
We  
Here we come, and  
You and I
