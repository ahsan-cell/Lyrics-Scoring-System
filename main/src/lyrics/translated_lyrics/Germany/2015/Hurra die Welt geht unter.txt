**Translated Lyrics: "Hooray, the World is Ending" ft. Henning May**

**[Part 1: Maxim]**  
Clothing is against God, we wear fig leaves  
Swinging on vines over Heinrichplatz (Hey)  
And the elders talk about the struggle for housing  
At a barbecue in the ruins of Deutsche Bank  
Birds' nests in a tattered neon sign  
We warm ourselves by a burning German flag  
And when someone sleeps on a park bench  
It's only because a girl leans on his arm  
Three hours of work a day, 'cause that's all we need  
Tonight we’ll come up with names for stars (names for stars)  
Thanking that bomb from ten years ago  
And making love until the sun can see us  
Do you remember when we carved into the tables at school  
“Please, Lord, don’t forgive them, for they know what they do” (they know what they do)  
Beneath the cobblestones waits the sandy beach  
If not with rap, then with a pump gun  

**[Hook: Henning May]**  
And we sing in the nuclear shelter:  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
And we sing in the nuclear shelter:  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
Paradise lies in ruins  

**[Part 2: Tarek]**  
Grab your bow and arrow, we’ll hunt a tasty treat  
There’s no prison left, we grill on the prison bars  
Burnt McDonald's bear witness to our heroic deeds  
Since we chased Nestlé off the fields  
Apples taste like apples and tomatoes like tomatoes  
And we cook our meals in soldiers' helmets  
You want to smoke? Go pick something in the garden  
But our life today can also be endured sober  
Come, let’s drive through the moss-covered  
Halls of the Reichstag, no office chair races  
Our front doors don’t need locks anymore  
Money turned to confetti and we’ve slept better  
A gold bar is the same to us as a brick  
The fire goes out, throw in another Bible  
The kids are spooked, 'cause I tell them about the Pope  
This life is so beautiful, who needs an afterlife?  
(Who needs an afterlife? Who needs an afterlife?)  

**[Hook: Henning May]**  
And we sing in the nuclear shelter:  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
And we sing in the nuclear shelter:  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
Paradise lies in ruins  

**[Part 3: Nico]**  
The cows graze behind us, we smoke pot, play backgammon  
Where Potsdamer Platz used to be  
When I wake up, I’ll stroke your hair once more  
“Darling, I’m going to work. I’ll be right back”  
We get up when we want, leave when we want  
Look how we want, have sex how we want  
And not like the church or porn tells us  
Baby, the time with you was so beautiful  
Yes, now it’s over again, but our kids don’t cry  
'Cause we’re raising them all together  
Do you remember when they wanted to put out the big fire?  
That feeling when our passports melted in the flames?  
They really thought their crap would last forever  
I show the kids Monopoly, but they don’t understand  
“A hundred-euro bill? What’s that supposed to be?  
Why should I take something from you when we share everything?”  

**[Hook: Henning May]**  
And we sing in the nuclear shelter:  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
And we sing in the nuclear shelter:  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
“Hooray, this world is ending!”  
Paradise lies in ruins
