**Translated Lyrics:**

You always act like it’s so easy  
Because you want to help me when I’m feeling lost  
That’s kind of you, and I really appreciate it  
But it doesn’t move me forward  
You’re so firm and unshakeable  
You’re at peace with yourself, and that’s good for you  
And I’m fine with it, hey, I envy you for that  
But unfortunately, it doesn’t change anything  

**[Bridge]**  
The way you believe is how you live  
And that’s okay, as long as it works for you  
Hold on to that, but it doesn’t work for me  

**[Chorus]**  
My gut says "Yes" to my head, but my head says "No" to my gut  
And I stand between the two  
I stand between the two  
My gut says "Yes" to my head, but my head says "No"  
Then it shakes itself  
I stand between the two  
I stand between the two  
And I don’t know  

**[Verse 2]**  
Because I’m always searching for something, and something’s always missing  
Even though it’s actually good and things are going fine  
I keep an eye on you and how you do it  
But I’m not like you  
I have ideas in my head and a buzz in my step  
I always have plans, I’m always overbooked  
But when it gets quiet around me, the ghosts come out  
And I question myself every time  

**[Bridge]**  
The way you believe is how you live  
And that’s okay, as long as it works for you  
Hold on to that, but it doesn’t work for me  

**[Chorus]**  
My gut says "Yes" to my head, but my head says "No" to my gut  
And I stand between the two  
I stand between the two  
My gut says "Yes" to my head, but my head says "No"  
Then it shakes itself  
I stand between the two  
I stand between the two  
And I don’t know  
I don’t know  
I don’t know  
I don’t know  

**[Verse 3]**  
Because I’m always searching for something, and something’s always missing  
It’s never enough and always too little  
The way you believe is how you live  
Listen to your heart, as long as that works  
As long as that works  

**[Chorus]**  
My gut says "Yes" to my head, but my head says "No" to my gut  
And I stand between the two  
I stand between the two  
My gut says "Yes" to my head, but my head says "No"  
Then it shakes itself  
I stand between the two  
I stand between the two  
And I don’t know  
I don’t know
