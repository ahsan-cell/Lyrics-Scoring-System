**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Alvaro Soler & Jennifer Lopez]  
I’ll tell you clearly, clearly  
It’s nothing strange, strange  
This is how it can be, my love  
A tiny world, tiny  
We’re hand in hand  
All we need is love  
It can be, my love  

[Chorus: Alvaro Soler & Jennifer Lopez, Alvaro Soler]  
I want this to be the world that answers  
From East to West  
And under the same sun  
Now we’re leaving  
If we celebrate together  
Here we all are under the same sun  
Under the same sun  
Give me, give me, give it to me  
Under the same sun  

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez, Alvaro Soler & Both]  
What’s up, J. Lo?  
Get rid of the bad, bad (Yes)  
Don’t say stop, stop  
It’s worth it, my love, worth it, my love  
There are no borders, you’ll see  
It will be what you want  
What you want, my love  
It can be, my love  
(With love, it can be)  

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Alvaro Soler & Both]  
I want this to be the world that answers  
From East to West  
And under the same sun  
Now we’re leaving  
If we celebrate together  
Here we all are  
Under the same sun  
(With spirit)  
(Here we go)  
Under the same sun  
Let’s go  
Everyone,  
Under the same sun  
(I want to hear you sing)  

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez, Alvaro Soler & Both]  
I want the world to, world to, world to (Sing)  
I want the world to unite, my love (Yes, yes)  
I want the world to, world to, world to  
I want the world to unite, my love  
Unite, my love  

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez, Alvaro Soler & Both]  
I want this to be the world that answers  
From East to West  
And under the same sun  
Now we’re leaving  
If we celebrate together  
Here we all are  
Under the same sun  
(We are one)  
(Under the sun)  
Under the same sun  
Everyone, let’s go  
We’re leaving  
If we celebrate together  
Here we all are  
Under the same sun  
Under the same sun
