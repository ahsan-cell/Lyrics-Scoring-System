**Translated Lyrics:**

Come on, give up, come on, give up, says my mind  
And I stare silently at the wall with gray eyes  
I search the room but find no door  
A way out, a quick escape from here  
My head is racing and smoke is rising;  
Blood boils, heart pounds, short of breath, nerves burning, sparks flying  

**[Chorus]**  
Everything's burning, everything's going up in flames  
All that remains are ashes and smoke  
But between the black clouds, I see a little bit of blue  
I hold my breath, walk over the coals  
Everything will be alright  

**[Verse 2]**  
Too little space, too tight, even for one alone  
Before they fall on me, I tear down the walls  
Come on, stand up, come on, stand up, I tell my mind  
And if there’s no door, then I’ll just go through the wall  
All of this has to go, all of this must be new  
Stones melting, shards flying, straight ahead on new paths  
Through the rain of fire  

**[Chorus]**  
Everything's burning, everything's going up in flames  
All that remains are ashes and smoke  
But between the black clouds, I see a little bit of blue  
I hold my breath, walk over the coals  
Everything will be alright  

**[Bridge]**  
And when it burns inside me again, I know now for sure  
That you fight fire with fire  
Everything's burning, everything's going up in flames  
All that remains are ashes and smoke  
But between the black clouds, I see a little bit of blue  
I hold my breath, walk over the coals  

**[Chorus]**  
Everything's burning, everything's going up in flames  
All that remains are ashes and smoke  
But between the black clouds, I see a little bit of blue  
I hold my breath, walk over the coals  
Everything will be alright
