**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Brra)

[Part 1]  
Miami Yacine, you bitch, I stay ruthless just like Locke the Boss  
Rheinische Straße, deep into the night, the shore is cooked by junkies (Pah, pah)  
Cocaine, coca-, cocaine  
Flex from Peru or Costa Rica  
Purple bills stashed in tax havens like Verona Pooth (Pah, pah, pah)  
Three years in prison for my brother, 'cause he was dealing back then in a Range Rover (Ah)  
Tony, Sosa, Tony, Tony, Sosa  
Do what you want, I’m staying here anyway  
Forget your training plan, son of a dog, the ghetto keeps me in shape (Brra)  
The three-star chef serves Miami Yacine Chateaubriand  
Screw your Renault Clio, I hold the top position  
Making millions with Despo, it better pay off  
Otherwise, I’ll keep swimming against the current  
68' black Chevy (Pah)  
Faking my death like Machiavelli (Machiavelli)  
Ya habub, get the Çarşaf ready (Ya habub)  
Five hundred grams of coke, ask Miami  
To all my brothers behind bars  
They can’t witness my rise  
Five gold chains around my neck like Mr. T (Mr., Mr.)  
Forget your sympathy

[Hook]  
Two kilos of cocaine, straight from Costa Rica  
All pure like the Mona Lisa, soon I’ll be a big earner  
And they ask me: “Where does all this white stuff come from?”  
I’ll just tell you: “Mon frère, don’t jinx it, things are going well for me”  
Two kilos of cocaine, straight from Costa Rica  
All pure like the Mona Lisa, soon I’ll be a big earner  
And they ask me: “Where does all this white stuff come from?”  
I’ll just tell you: “Mon frère, don’t jinx it, things are going well for me” (Sk-sk-skrrt)

[Part 2]  
Sitting in a Mercedes-Benz surrounded by women like Bella Hadid (Wouh, wouh)  
Deep into the morning gray, sex in the hotel room without a condom (Pah, pah, pah)  
Gucci sombrero, Gucci-, Gucci sombrero  
Lying under palm trees on the beach of Montego (Ah)  
Tracksuit from Manchester United and wearing a Breitling on my arm (Pah, pah, pah)  
On my plasma TV, there’s a documentary about gangsters from the 30s  
Cosa Nostra, Cosa, Cosa Nostra  
Rappers nowadays are just fashion bloggers  
Yacine the Godfather wears Gianni Versace like Tupac Shakur (Sk-sk-skrrt)  
My ex-girlfriend is calling me now, 'cause I’m on the superstar path (Brra)  
Rolex, number one on the podium  
My boys smuggle dope in mopeds  
BKA, LKA  
They know, with the Maghrebi, it’s running smooth like Benzema  
Dribbling through like Ben Arfa  
The bills are colorful like highlighters  
The Russian hoe in the passenger seat is a groupie of mine named Svetlana (Häh)  
Sleeping with daughters of oligarchs, doing business with sheikhs from the Emirates (Emirates)  
Akhi, never again in depressive phases like shore junkies on chemicals (Never again)

[Hook]  
Two kilos of cocaine, straight from Costa Rica  
All pure like the Mona Lisa, soon I’ll be a big earner  
And they ask me: “Where does all this white stuff come from?”  
I’ll just tell you: “Mon frère, don’t jinx it, things are going well for me”  
Two kilos of cocaine, straight from Costa Rica  
All pure like the Mona Lisa, soon I’ll be a big earner  
And they ask me: “Where does all this white stuff come from?”  
I’ll just tell you: “Mon frère, don’t jinx it, things are going well for me”
