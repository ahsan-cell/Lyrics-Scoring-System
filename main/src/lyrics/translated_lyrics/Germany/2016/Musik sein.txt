**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
What a night, I woke up with a headache  
Pouring coffee like it's in slow motion into the glass  
The "If you want, you can stay longer" is followed by an uncertain silence  
You close the door, it gets quiet, I watch you leave  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And with you, trumpets, violins, and choirs, something to break the silence here  
Then drumrolls and soft piano notes  

[Chorus]  
Hey, there should be music everywhere you are  
And when it’s at its best, play it again and again  
Hey, there should be music, wherever you are  
Because when it’s at its best, when it’s at its best  

[Verse 2]  
The last time at the sea, it feels like an eternity ago  
Packing my favorites and the essentials together  
Finally getting out of our hometown, it gets smaller in the mirror  
And just up ahead, the saltwater kisses the sand  

[Pre-Chorus]  
And with us, trumpets, violins, and choirs, something to break the silence here  
Then drumrolls and soft piano notes  

[Chorus]  
Hey, there should be music everywhere you are  
And when it’s at its best, play it again and again  
Hey, there should be music, wherever you are  
Because when it’s at its best, play it again and again  

[Post-Chorus]  
Play it again and again (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh), again and again (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)  
Play it again and again (Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh), hey, there should be music  

[Bridge]  
When we fall in love  
When life knocks us down  
And we’re drunk on happiness  
Shouldn’t there be music?  

[Chorus]  
Hey, there should be music, wherever you are  
And when it’s at its best, play it again and again  
Hey, there should be music (Hey, there should be music; Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh), wherever you are (Wherever you are; Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)  
And when it’s at its best (And when it’s at its best; Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh), play it again and again  

[Post-Chorus]  
Play it again and again (Again and again; Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh) again and again (again and again; Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh)  
Play it again and again (again and again; Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh), hey, there should be music  

[Outro]  
Hey, there should be music
