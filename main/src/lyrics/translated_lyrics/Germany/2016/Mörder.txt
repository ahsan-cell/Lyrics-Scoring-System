**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook: Bonez MC]  
Everyone's acting like a killer now  
'Cause your friend has a friend, whose friend has a "Ballermann"  
A bullet in your body  
You're doing fine, your boys are smoking joints in front of the camera  
And they say bad words  
'Cause your friend, whose friend's best friend has a "Ballermann"  
Second bullet in your body  
One last time on Snapchat  

[Part 1: Bonez MC]  
They love to stir things up, but don’t want any war (Uh, ahh)  
They're criminals, but don’t even have a source for weed (Muaha)  
Straight from the jungle, stocks on the street  
Condemned to Sheytan, grown on a plantation (Yeah)  
No matter what time it is, I weigh it out (Eh)  
Crocodile on my jacket, 187 on the flag (Ah-ah-ah)  
I don’t care who you are, you son of a bitch (Brra)  
'Cause you'll never be part of my crew (Never)  
People like you don’t interest me  
'Cause there are unfortunately enough of you  

[Hook: Bonez MC]  
Everyone's acting like a killer now  
'Cause your friend has a friend, whose friend has a "Ballermann"  
A bullet in your body  
You're doing fine, your boys are smoking joints in front of the camera  
And they say bad words  
'Cause your friend, whose friend's best friend has a "Ballermann"  
Second bullet in your body  
One last time on Snapchat  

[Part 2: RAF Camora]  
They threaten me with plastic figures  
Don’t have anyone for a drive-by  
Leisure soldiers in an undercut look  
Tell me, who takes you seriously at all?  
Your weapons are made of plastic, made in China  
Not even three hundred views, even with a big feature  
DJ, give me a pull-up, everyone claims they're killers  
Dancing through the club like a medicine man  
Nine bullets in the thorax for all the fake 50s  
To me, they're like Borat, entertaining kids  
Everything revolves around the dollar, we’re rolling on scooters  
You’re either a killer or a victim, everything else is just image, that’s why we sing  

[Hook: Bonez MC]  
Everyone's acting like a killer now

'Cause your friend, whose friend's best friend has a "Ballermann"  
Second bullet in your body  
One last time on Snapchat (-chat, -chat, -chat, -chat)  

[Part 3: Gzuz]  
People write: “Gzuz, be a bit nicer” (No)  
I clean the bullets, my girl on the stepper (Yeah)  
Looking for an enemy and his slice will be riddled (Rrah)  
I remain a criminal, screw you rappers  
Gun to my stomach, bullet in the chamber  
I take the drugs, your money, and your girl (Yeah)  
Gzuz 187, that’s a lifelong hustle (Wouh)  
A bit of sport and a bottle of Jägermeister (Yeah)  
Convertible, check (Yes; uh), glass gets emptied  
Of course, there’s sex, 'cause I'm swiping now (Hah)  
Just bang her in the parking space (Zack, zack, zack)  
I’ll finish on her face and ask her how it tastes (And ask her how it tastes)
