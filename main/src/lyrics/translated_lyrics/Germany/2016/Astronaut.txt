**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Andreas Bourani]  
I take off, nothing keeps me on the ground  
Everything's pale and gray  
Haven't flown in too long  
Like an astronaut  

[Part 1: Sido]  
We walk around with our snouts full, our heads are empty  
Sitting in the dirt up to our necks, with holes in our hearts  
Drowning worries and problems in a cup full of wine  
With a smile made of stone, we can't think of anything better  
We've already forgotten tomorrow who we were yesterday  
We've stuffed ourselves full and forgot to pay  
Leaving everything behind for more ash and dust  
We all want it to fit, but we don't fit in  

[Pre-Hook: Sido]  
The voice of reason has long been silenced, we can't hear it anymore  
Because sometimes we feel like we don't belong here  
There's no forward or backward anymore, just up and down  
One in a hundred million, a tiny dot above the ground, I take off  

[Hook: Andreas Bourani]  
I take off, nothing keeps me on the ground  
Everything's pale and gray  
Haven't flown in too long  
Like an astronaut  
I see the world from above  
The rest fades into blue  
I've lost time and space up here  
Like an astronaut  

[Part 2: Sido]  
In the darkness of night  
Up here everything is so peaceful, but down there it's wild  
We all contribute to it, yet we break under the weight  
We hope for God, but we've missed the miracle  
We keep building higher, until it reaches infinity  
Almost eight billion people, yet humanity is missing  
From up here, suddenly nothing matters anymore  
From here, you see no borders and the color of skin  

[Pre-Hook: Sido]  
All this noise about nothing quiets down, I can't hear you anymore  
Slowly I'm feeling like I belong here  
There's no forward or backward anymore, just up and down  
One in a hundred million, a tiny dot above the ground  

[Hook: Andreas Bourani & Sido]  
I take off, nothing keeps me on the ground  
Everything's pale and gray  
Haven't flown in too long  
Like an astronaut (Oh)  
I see the world from above  
The rest fades into blue (Yeah)  
I've lost time and space up here  
Like an astronaut  

[Post-Hook: Andreas Bourani]  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)  
Like an astronaut  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)  

[Bridge: Andreas Bourani]  
And at the sight of this beauty  
Everything comes back to me  
Aren't we actually alive  
To love, to be?  
Here I would love to stay forever  
But I'm just a blink of an eye  
That after five billion years  
Can hardly be anything more  

[Hook: Andreas Bourani & Sido]  
I take off (Oh), nothing keeps me on the ground (Ah)  
Everything's pale and gray (Yeah)  
Haven't flown in too long  
Like an astronaut (Oh)  
I see the world from above (Ah)  
The rest fades into blue (Into blue)  
I've lost time and space up here  
Like an astronaut  

[Post-Hook: Andreas Bourani & Sido]  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh; yeah)  
Like an astronaut (Oh)  
(Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh; ah)  
Like an astronaut
