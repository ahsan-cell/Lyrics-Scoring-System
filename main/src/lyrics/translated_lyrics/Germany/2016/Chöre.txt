**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Why are you worrying? What are you afraid of?  
What’s there to ponder? What do you have against yourself?  
I don’t understand you, mhm-mhm  
You always see things in black and hold yourself back  
Nothing is good enough, you push yourself away  
When will you stop this?

[Pre-Chorus]  
The way I see you is incomprehensible to you  
Come, let me show you

[Chorus]  
I’ll let confetti rain down for you, I’ll shower you with it  
Shouting your name from every speaker, you’re the best person there is  
I’ll roll out the red carpet, through the city, right to your door  
You mean everything to me, and the choirs sing for you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh, and the choirs sing for you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh, and the choirs sing for you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh

[Verse 2]  
Stop resisting, it doesn’t make any sense  
You still have confetti in the crease on your forehead  
Why can’t you understand, mhm-mhm  
Come out from your hiding, I can already see the spark  
Let me see it for a moment, I almost forgot how it feels  
You with a smile on your face

[Pre-Chorus]  
The way I see you is incomprehensible to you  
Come, let me show you

[Chorus]  
I’ll let confetti rain down for you, I’ll shower you with it  
Shouting your name from every speaker, you’re the best person there is  
I’ll roll out the red carpet, through the city, right to your door  
You mean everything to me, and the choirs sing for you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh, and the choirs sing for you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh, and the choirs sing for you  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohh

[Outro]  
And the trumpets play for you  
And the drums sound for you  
And the choirs sing for you
