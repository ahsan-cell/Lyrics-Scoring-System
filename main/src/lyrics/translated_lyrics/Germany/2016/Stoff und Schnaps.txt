**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook: Lil Kleine & Ronnie Flex]  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
Then I'll come by, I won't come alone  
'Cause I've got stuff and drinks  
I've got stuff and drinks  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
Then I'll come by, I won't come alone  
'Cause I've got stuff (stuff) and drinks (and drinks)  
I've got stuff (hey) and drinks  

[Part 1: Ronnie Flex & Lil' Kleine]  
If your girl wants to chill and calls me up  
I'll come by, 'cause I'm flexible (flex)  
Now I'm in the club (club) standing in front of the mirror (mirror)  
I won't lie, we want to make some money (uh)  
Pick up the pace, sweat on my brow  
Pupils wide, everything's easy, easy  
My shoes are dirty, I haven't slept  
A little sex and I’ll stay in bed  
I'm coming with Ronnie Flex, we smoke  
And count cash, 'cause we always cash in (cash in)  
Your mom is hot and likes it wild  
She loves sex, I’ll book her for myself  

[Hook: Lil Kleine]  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
Then I'll come by, I won't come alone  
'Cause I've got stuff and drinks  
I've got stuff and drinks  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
Then I'll come by, I won't come alone  
'Cause I've got stuff and drinks  
I've got stuff and drinks  

[Part 2: Lil Kleine & Ronnie Flex]  
We say yes to MDMA  
Your wife’s a slut, she’s sleeping with your dad (slut)  
No filter, I say what I say (ey, ey)  
'Cause when I'm down, no one’s around  
Hey, bitch, make way, we’re all coming in together  
Bend over, your mom knows this (twerk)  
Bitches like you, I know them and see it every time  
Tomorrow you won’t remember anything, that’s fine  
So, everything's easy, you see? (you)  
I call Kleine, he’s joining in (skrrt)  
It won’t be long until my time comes  
You smell hash and sex when I come by  

[Hook: Lil Kleine]  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
Then I'll come by, I won't come alone  
'Cause I've got stuff and drinks  
I've got stuff and drinks  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
Then I'll come by, I won't come alone  
'Cause I've got stuff and drinks  
I've got stuff and drinks  

[Outro: Lil Kleine]  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem (-blem, -blem, -blem, -blem, -blem)  
If your girl wants to chill, no problem
