**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We take it easy, but it’s not the usual  
He already knows my love is fire  
His heart was a stone, but then his hands wandered  
I turned him into gold, and that made him happy  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Well, I’ll be your fantasy, I’ll be your favorite things  
We could be beautiful  
Let’s get drunk on the good life, I’ll take you to paradise  
Say you’ll never let me go  

[Chorus]  
Deep in my bones, I can feel you  
Take me back to a time only we knew  
A hideaway  
We could spend the night watching an old movie  
Smoking some weed on my couch in the back room  
A hideaway  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Say you’ll never let me go  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Ah  
Ah  
Say you’ll never let me go  

[Chorus]  
Deep in my bones, I can feel you  
Take me back to a time only we knew  
A hideaway  
We could spend the night watching an old movie  
Smoking some weed on my couch in the back room  
A hideaway  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Say you’ll never let me go  

[Outro]  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Ahh, ahh, ahh  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Ah  
Say you’ll never let me go  
Ah
