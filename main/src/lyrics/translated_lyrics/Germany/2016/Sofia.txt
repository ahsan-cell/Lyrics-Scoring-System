**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I dream of when I was young  
Without a worry in my heart  
I still see that moment  
It faded away, disappeared  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I no longer believe you, I no longer desire you, -eo  
I only see you, I only desire you, -eo  

[Chorus]  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Tell me, Sofia-a-a  
How does she look at you, tell me  
How does she look at you, tell me  
I know it’s not, I know it’s not, I know it’s just  
I know I’m no longer me, me, me, and  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze, Sofia  

[Verse 2]  
You say we were happy  
It’s all in the past, it’s all in the past  
I know I clipped your wings  
He made you fly, he made you dream  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I no longer believe you, I no longer desire you, -eo  
I only see you, I only desire you, -eo  

[Chorus]  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Tell me, Sofia-a-a  
How does she look at you, tell me  
How does she look at you, tell me  
I know it’s not, I know it’s not, I know it’s just  
I know I’m no longer me, me, me, and  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze, Sofia  

[Post-Chorus]  
And why don’t you tell me the truth? Ey  
I’m still without your gaze, Sofia  
Ey, ey, ey, ey  
And why don’t you tell me the truth?  

[Bridge]  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze  
Tell me, Sofia  
How does she look at you, tell me  
How does she look at you (Wuh)  

[Chorus]  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Tell me, Sofia-a-a  
How does she look at you, tell me  
How does she look at you, tell me  
I know it’s not, I know it’s not, I know it’s just  
I know I’m no longer me, me, me, and  
Look, Sofia  
Without your gaze, I carry on  
Without your gaze, Sofia
