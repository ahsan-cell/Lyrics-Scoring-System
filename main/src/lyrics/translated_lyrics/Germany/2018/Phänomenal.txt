**Translated Lyrics:**

[Pre-Chorus]  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  
Baby, no one is as beautiful as you  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  
I want more, I can't get enough  
The way you move is not normal  
The other women don't matter to me  
I'll gladly tell you once more  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  

[Chorus]  
Phenomenal (Hey), so phenomenal  
Show me your hip swing one more time (Hey)  
So phenomenal  
You're top tier, just like Real (Hey)  
When the sun rises today  
I want to see us dancing still  
Babe, I'll tell you again  
You are so phenomenal, phenomenal  

[Verse 1]  
I see her standing at the bar, mhm  
My brother says, "Come on, just talk to her!"  
"Babe, should we grab a drink?" eyy  
She gives me a smile and dances close  
She knows what she's doing, she's ultra-hot  
With every touch, the ice melts  
Her hair smells like coconut, mhm  
Her golden skin, it turns me on  

[Bridge 1]  
One, two tequila shots  
Feel the music, everything spins in my head  
Come on, baby, take my hand  
The party continues on the beach  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  
Baby, no one is as beautiful as you  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  
I want more, I can't get enough  
The way you move is not normal  
The other women don't matter to me  
I'll gladly tell you once more  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  

[Chorus]  
Phenomenal (Hey), so phenomenal  
Show me your hip swing one more time (Hey)  
So phenomenal  
You're top tier, just like Real (Hey)  
When the sun rises today  
I want to see us dancing still  
Babe, I'll tell you again  
You are so phenomenal  

[Verse 2]  
You're somehow different, mhm  
A mix of Havana and CÃ´te d'Azur  
Baby, are you ready? Mhm  
Then just hop in, we're leaving here  
Babe, you're more than a rendezvous  
There are no witnesses, only the moon watching  
Who is Adriana Lima? Mhm  
Our story is just beginning  

[Bridge 2]  
One, two looks from you  
Feel your lips, everything spins before me  
Come on, baby, take my hand  
We dance barefoot on the beach  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  
Baby, no one is as beautiful as you  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal  
I want more, I can't get enough  
The way you move is not normal  
The other women don't matter to me  
I'll gladly tell you once more  
You are phenomenal, phenomenal (So phenomenal)  

[Chorus]  
Phenomenal (Hey), so phenomenal  
Show me your hip swing one more time (Hey)  
So phenomenal  
You're top tier, just like Real (Hey)  
When the sun rises today  
I want to see us dancing still  
Babe, I'll tell you again  
You are so phenomenal, phenomenal
