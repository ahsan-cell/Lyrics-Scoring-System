**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Ahh)  
(Ahh)  
(Primo) First we came  
And everyone saw how it escalated, ahh (Ey), ey (Primo)  
It expands  
They play us in Phuket, Ibiza, Budapest and it’s a hit (Ahh), ahh  
Ah (Mhh, Primo)  

[Part 1]  
We were the first (Yeah, man)  
The first in Germany, platinum stamp (Yeah, man)  
Suddenly gangsters were dancing to West African samples  
For them, the music was just “Coco Jamboo”  
But then they saw in the club, all the ladies going wild  
Back then, my buddy and I were so broke  
Today my buddy has snagged a house  
Snap, snap, snap  
I’m hooking up with celebrities from the upper class  
'Cause they all want bottles, cash, and fun  
Doesn’t matter if it’s Camora or Alabas  
So dance, dance, dance a little more to the beat for your Snapchat  
Jealous looks are harvested (Yeah)  
But there’s no stress, you’re never the boss  
Just a nobody like Chefket  

[Hook]  
Call me Primo, the second, the third writes no history (Ah)  
My team Primo, Jamaica, Africa, part of my clique  
Yeah, man, Primo, Primo, let’s party, my amigo  
Welcome to Vienna, you’ll find me under the sun with John and Farido (Ah, ah)  

[Part 2]  
Controlling like the Vatican, Vatican (Mhh)  
Eating up rappers, cannibals, cannibals (Mhh)  
Shout out to my Arabs and the guys from the Balkans  
Remmo Clan, Ali-Khan, ya salam  
Vroom-vroom in the Panamera (Ah)  
Fucker like Cannavaro  
Thousands of problems, but cash distracts  
Got a shell on my head like Calimero  
Hoes knew the music from Rihanna and Drake  
But we came into the game like N.W.A  
Pow, pow, pow, it’s all too late  
Victory parade in a convertible  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we let ourselves go  
Buying from Donna Versace in stores  
No problem at all  
Everything will end, so I’m already starting to count the days  

[Hook]  
Call me Primo, the second, the third writes no history  
My team Primo, Jamaica, Africa, part of my clique  
Yeah, man, Primo, Primo, let’s party, my amigo  
Welcome to Vienna, you’ll find me under the sun with John and Farido  
Call me Primo, the second, the third writes no history  
My team Primo, Jamaica, Africa, part of my clique  
Yeah, man, Primo, Primo, let’s party, my amigo  
Welcome to Vienna, you’ll find me under the sun with John and Farido  

[Bridge]  
Brother, you can trust me, never test Capo R-A  
If necessary, I’ll come to you at night in your dreams like La Mano Nera  
Three Chays and I in one room, my dick does Capoeira  
Crows at my back tear everything apart, la Omertà  

[Hook]  
Call me Primo, the second, the third writes no history  
My team Primo, Jamaica, Africa, part of my clique  
Yeah, man, Primo, Primo, let’s party, my amigo  
Welcome to Vienna, you’ll find me under the sun with John and Farido
