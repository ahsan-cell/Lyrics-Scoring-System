The lyrics you've provided are primarily in English, with repeated phrases that seem to be in a rhythmic and chant-like style. The term "nami" appears to be a playful or stylized expression, possibly derived from the Japanese word for "wave" (波, pronounced "nami"). 

Here’s the translation while maintaining the tone and structure:
