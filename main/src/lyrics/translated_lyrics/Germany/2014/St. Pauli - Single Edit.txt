**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We're approaching the end of the broadcast  
The lights go out, the dreams come alive  
But who says it has to end here?  
So come on, the night is young  
And it's just a hop to euphoria, oh, yes  

[Chorus]  
On St. Pauli, the lights are still shining  
There's still a long way to go before the shift ends  
Because all in all,  
We have every reason to dance  

[Verse 2]  
Bad teeth, good vibes  
Curves above, underworld below  
Red light and a black eye  
Well, itâ€™s not exactly a petting zoo  
So if you want to experience something, you know where to go, oh, yes  

[Chorus]  
Yes, on St. Pauli, the lights are still shining  
There's still a long way to go before the shift ends  
Because all in all,  
We have every reason to dance  

[Instrumental]  

[Verse 3]  
They come to erase memories  
But the most beautiful ones are born here  
Amidst enchanting creatures  
All driven here by longing  
To celebrate life and love, oh, yes  

[Chorus]  
Because on St. Pauli, the lights are still shining  
There's still a long way to go before the shift ends  
Because all in all,  
We have every reason to dance  

[Outro]  
La-la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la
