**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1]  
Everyone wants to know how to live love to the fullest romantically,  
No one helps us – fair play.  
Thank God for film and TV,  
That's where I get my education from (Yes indeed).  
Believe me, it’s going to be great; we already have the reason for your story,  
Why you’re filled with rage in your youth phase.  
Your dad didn’t come to your school play,  
But we’ll find something that really hurts.

[Pre-Hook]  
We’ve known each other for years,  
You don’t need to say anything now.  
I wanted to ask: Shall we take the next step?

[Hook]  
Do you want to do drugs with me?  
Then red roses will rain down.  
I saw it in a soap opera.  
Do you want to do drugs with me?

[Post-Hook]  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Because a wreck is a place where a treasure sleeps.

[Part 2]  
Now we’re free, chilling on gigantic mountain peaks.  
You have to say: “No one can dig our pain.”  
We’re collecting happy stoner Sundays  
For the hit-laden montage (Yeah, ah).  
Come on, it’s going to be romantic,  
When I hold you so you don’t fall off the toilet edge.  
Then we deserve a candle package  
For the first shared apartment in a men’s restroom.  
An autumn scene, because it fits (Because it fits),  
And I drop to my knees and pull out of my jacket  
A little box; you know what’s going on.

[Hook]  
Do you want to do drugs with me?  
Then red roses will rain down.  
I saw it in a soap opera.  
Do you want to do drugs with me?

[Post-Hook]  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Because a wreck is a place where a treasure sleeps.

[Part 3]  
And then we need epic fights over who gets the lousy H.  
Audience: Smoking babies.  
They aren’t spoiled; they have to spoon up instant soup.  
And they play with doll heads far removed from their bodies.  
You want to escape in a cliché way to a country house,  
I’ll yell something like: “My hand is about to slip!”  
“You’re not going anywhere with the kids!”  
I’ll chase you through a labyrinth with an axe (Ha).  
In winter, because I celebrate the image (Yeah).  
Let’s make our life more cinematic than Til Schweiger.  
It has action, drama, and comedy,  
So what do you say, mon chéri?

[Hook]  
Do you want to do drugs with me?  
Then red roses will rain down.  
To steal the show from the movie.  
Do you want to do drugs with me?

[Post-Hook]  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.  
(Come) Because a wreck is a place where a treasure sleeps.  
Come, let’s go (Down the river).  
Come, let’s go (Down the river).  
Come, let’s go (Down the river).  
Come, let’s go, come, let’s go down the river together.
