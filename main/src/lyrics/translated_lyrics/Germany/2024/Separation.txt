**Translated Lyrics:**

They’re cute, those ideal young couples at Ikea  
While I was buying Nikes in times when I wasn’t getting laid  
Why change my underwear? We die single anyway  
Might as well unleash some beautiful splashes in Belgium and the Netherlands  
Oh damn! Watching them wash their tongues in another mouth  
I lament the transparency of their shower curtains  
Not that I’m suffering, in the midst of an adult crisis  
The most accident-prone want me to get hard in a hurry  
Getting my kicks, sure, but what about the other shoe?  
No one thinks monogamy for two-thousand-twelve  
I pity your girls sold on romance  
When those who are dream of orgies from Ancient Rome  
It creates high-ranking fetishists  
Who, to unwind after work, actually take a dump  
On the faces of their beloved wives  
To preserve a love lost in the street behind the town hall  

**[Chorus]**  
Adulthood makes me play with words  
If your mistress is looking for a husband, shave your head  
I’ve been crazy, gift me a box of Legos  
It’s when my back hurts that I think I need a girl...  
Adulthood makes me play with words  
If your mistress is looking for a husband, shave your head  
I’ve been crazy, gift me a box of Legos  
So I can have fun instead of doing my marital duties  

**[Verse 2]**  
You see me, working Monday to Friday  
Pushing the cart Saturday afternoon? You’re  
Getting tangled up over shampoo  
Sunday with the in-laws, a life where everything’s premeditated  
Except the end, when a mix of perfumes raises your suspicions  
Clowns still make hickeys  
Made to be a good lover, an uncle  
Protect your girl or I’ll find your son’s middle name  
If he’s dark-haired and you’re both blonde  
It means some thrusts can skip generations  
Good idea to change the poufs in the living room  
In November, it’s time for divorce and separation  
Anyway, today’s women leave  
Letting you find your teenage room at your parents’  
Anyway, I have a problem with exes  
As soon as she talks to me a bit, I wonder if she wants it in her hair  

**[Chorus]**  
Adulthood makes me play with words  
If your mistress is looking for a husband, shave your head  
I’ve been crazy, gift me a box of Legos  
It’s when my back hurts that I think I need a girl...  
Adulthood makes me play with words  
If your mistress is looking for a husband, shave your head  
I’ve been crazy, gift me a box of Legos  
So I can have fun instead of doing my marital duties  

**[Verse 3]**  
I don’t want kids, I already have my voice to raise  
I’ve always found your IUD stylish  
A shaved head doesn’t mean we want to commit  
For me, life is just going from point A to point G  
Discovering she’s clitoral  
Less torrid, facing so many daily pressures  
By the way, speaking of sexual relations  
My favorite remains a girl at the end of her period in a ghetto hotel  
We could chill but we don’t dare  
Slap the "Mean Dog" sticker on the minivan  
You think you’re of age, I’ve only seen sweat  
I wish you a good evening talking about your insurers  
Without even noticing she cut her hair  
Your story is a true contraceptive  
Regrets take time playing Don Juan  
Offer appetizer-main-dessert, I’ll call while eating
