**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Hey, boy, how nice it is to see you  
I want to confess that I love you  
Your smile and your gaze are so beautiful  
Oh, what a shame you don’t feel anything  

[Hook: FOURTY]  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, woah (Hey)  

[Part 1: FOURTY]  
You’re just a means to an end for her  
I can change everything for her if I want  
Yesterday she was chilling in Chemnitz  
Today I’m taking her to Beverly Hills  
Giving her backshots, backshots, backshots  
I’m not her first and I won’t be her last  
If only she had thought a little  
She could have brought her friend along, ah  

[Pre-Hook: FOURTY]  
Bellydance, baby, she dances to “CABEZA”  
And today she’s celebrating her eighth semester  
Low-carb mommy, she’s not into bruschetta  
She only wants me, 'cause I’m a finesse master  
Hey, baby, it’s like a drug, give me more  
Tell me, is this love in the air or just something on the side?  
(One, two, three)  

[Hook: Bausa]  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, woah (Baui, hey, ah; it’s Bausa)  

[Part 2: Bausa]  
Ah, I’m having fun with life again when she speaks Spanish (Come here)  
She lifts the whole atmosphere to another level (Brra)  
I should actually go home, but I’ll stay a bit longer (Hehe)  
'Cause the vibe keeps climbing like Reinhold Messner (Ba-Baui)  

[Pre-Hook: Bausa]  
Picked up, but not ordered  
Baby does escort, but doesn’t want money  
All on me, what’s the world worth?  
We’re drunk driving to my hotel  
Hey, baby, you’re like a drug, give me more  
Tell me, is this love in the air or just something on the side?  
(One, two, three)  

[Hook: Bausa]  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, woah  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, handsome boy, come here  
Oh, come here, woah (Woah, woah, woah, woah)
