**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1: Luciano]  
What more do you want to talk about? Leave your comment (Loco)  
Cruising today in the Cullinan through my city  
Chasing goals, couldn't stop making moves (Boss)  
Today I own several million, I am (Brr)  
A real motherf***in' G  
Look properly at my table before my shooter fires bullets (Boh, boh, boh)  
What, no hunger, little Çöp?  
I'm still full of power, poh, poh (Not in your world)  
Bitch-Negro wants to speak up now too  
The opp-boy was a kid when I was on the streets  
Often pushing packages across my city  
Mind your mouth and respect the journey  
I hear "Please, please" often, man, my head's messed up  
Days in my DMs, I don’t want to be in your friend circle  
And all these bitches came with time  
Big-dick energy, your baby will spread the word  

[Interlude]  
Hey, I'm kinda glad you didn't pick up  
I kinda just called to hear your voice, so  
Your voice recording was enough  

[Hook: Jazeek]  
Starboy, but I still stay in the hood  
I got cash, I got money on me  
Baby, hit me up on IG, I’ll treat you right  
Come and send me your location, honey  
Come, shake that butt, come, drop that thing  
Come, bounce on me, on my yeah-yeah  
Come, shake that butt, come, drop that thing  
Come, bounce on me, on my yeah-yeah-yeah  

[Part 2: Luciano]  
And today I’m chartering jets (Yeah), traveling with the fam (Yeah)  
Watch is Richard Mille and for baby girl, Patek (Boh)  
Loco is heavy today, still got Dum-Dum under the bed (Boss)  
Look, I’m getting clever with business (Boh) and that’s why you can’t roll with me (Boh)  
Though a superstar, I show little face  
Bro, trust me, everyone’s solid in the clique  
Forget your stories, because the streets don’t forget  
Today in a Cullinan, but back then I had nothing  

[Pre-Hook: Jazeek]  
Yeah, show, a lot of bits, bits, no thanks  
Because they all know I’m never broke again  
Make you my girlfriend just for one night  
Because the next day I’m out again  

[Hook: Jazeek]  
Starboy, but I still stay in the hood  
I got cash, I got money on me  
Baby, hit me up on IG, I’ll treat you right (On IG, Bae)  
Come and send me your location, honey  
Come, shake that butt (Come, shake that butt), come, drop that thing  
Come, bounce on me, on my yeah-yeah  
Come, shake that butt, come, drop that thing  
Come, bounce on me, on my yeah-yeah-yeah  

[Outro: Jazeek]  
Yeah, this is how we do it, no, na-na, na-na  
Baby, can you do it? No, na-na, na-na  
Baby, Baby, Baby, we are Starboy  
Yeah, Lucio Loco, Jazeek  
(Forever)  
(It's Luciano, baby)
