**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Raffaella Carrà]  
I stroll all alone through the streets  
Carefully looking at the monuments  
The classic foreigner with a strange air  
Tiringly wandering around the city  
At one point during my walk  
A boy calls me from the side  
He seemed at first glance so well-behaved  
Offering to be my guide through the town  

[Chorus: Raffaella Carrà]  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me  

[Verse 2: Raffaella Carrà]  
Far from just a boy, so well-behaved  
He knew many things more than I did  
He took me many times to see the stars  
But I didn’t see anything of Santa Fe  

[Pre-Chorus: Raffaella Carrà]  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me  

[Chorus: Raffaella Carrà]  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Basically the best of Santa Fe  
Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pedro, Pe'  
Trust me
