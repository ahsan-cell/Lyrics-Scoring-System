**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yeah (Haha)

[Part 1]  
Iced Matcha Latte, late for Pilates  
Kiss on the left (Mwuah), kiss on the right (Mwuah), I'm wearing something spicy today  
I hop in the Range Rover with Carmen, Tina, and Angie  
For breakfast, a champagne at Bottegie Venetie (Uh)

[Pre-Hook]  
Up and down, we move in sync  
With the weapons of a woman, brra-pa-pa-pap  
I'm smart, but blonde and super mega hot  
These bitches could never, believe me, I can

[Hook]  
You want a body? (Yeah)  
Then you gotta push (Uh)  
Are you a hottie? (Yeah)  
They'll be watching (Uh)  
Hit the gym, get skinny, turn it into a show  
We're pretty in bikinis, that's abs, legs, and butt (Haha)

[Part 2]  
Business lunch with a bit of distance  
Rich woman looking for a richer man  
I'm out of the office, don’t call me  
This is Clean-Girl Aesthetic, beauty program  
Charlottenburg ladies, young, hot, and shady  
The push present for the baby has almost eighty carats

[Pre-Hook]  
Up and down, we move in sync  
With the weapons of a woman, brra-pa-pa-pap  
I'm smart, but blonde and super mega hot  
These bitches could never, believe me, I can

[Hook]  
You want a body? (Yeah)  
Then you gotta push (Uh)  
Are you a hottie? (Yeah)  
They'll be watching (Uh)  
Hit the gym, get skinny, turn it into a show  
We're pretty in bikinis, that's abs, legs, and butt

[Bridge]  
Breathe in, breathe out  
That’s not enough yet, push it deeper  
Come on, two more, don’t give up  
Damn, you’re doing great, push it, tiger

[Hook]  
You want a body? (Yeah)  
Then you gotta push (Uh)  
Are you a hottie? (Yeah)  
They'll be watching (Uh)  
Hit the gym, get skinny, turn it into a show  
We're pretty in bikinis, that's abs, legs, and butt (Haha)

[Outro]  
Abs, legs, and butt, B-B-Abs, legs, and butt  
We're pretty in bikinis, that's abs, legs, and butt, yeah  
Abs, legs, and butt, B-B-Abs, legs, and butt  
Hit the gym, get skinny, that's abs, legs, and butt, yeah
