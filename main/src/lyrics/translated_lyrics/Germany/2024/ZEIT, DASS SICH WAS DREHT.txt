**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Time for something to change)  
(What changes, what changes)  
(Time for something to change)  
(What changes, what changes)  
(Time for something to change)  

[Part 1: $OHO BANI]  
Dude, our time is coming, shit, I'm spinning the wheel  
And I'm coming with a few guys who just don't fit in  
I say: "Soon we'll go— if you keep this up"  
Dude, my world is burning, where's the passion?  

[Pre-Hook: $OHO BANI]  
Turn it up, I'm turning, turning it up  
I need ten guys and Rémy in my gut  
I'm not joking, brother, can you see that?  
Shit, I think it's time for something to change  

[Hook: Herbert Grönemeyer]  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  
Time for something to change  

[Part 2: $OHO BANI]  
Dude, give me kicks, give me tempo  
This ain't a game, this ain't Nintendo  
A boy hopes for a twist  
That's why he's feeling down on air  
Dude, tonight, make a stand  
Wake them up, dude, turn it up louder  
Screw them over, dude, make them mad  
Keep it going, and he’ll step out  
Believe in yourself  
Don't believe in God, man, believe in you  
Learn this text by heart  
They talk too much, yeah, don’t trust them  
Don’t stop, brother, keep turning  
Shout so loud, brother, make yourself hoarse  
And I know, yeah, it won't be easy  
But if you don't do it, then no one will  

[Pre-Hook: $OHO BANI]  
Turn it up, I'm turning, turning it up  
I need ten guys and Rémy in my gut  
I'm not joking, brother, can you see that?  
Shit, I think it's time for something to change  

[Hook: Herbert Grönemeyer]  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  
Time for something to change (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh-eh)  
What changes, what changes  

[Outro: $OHO BANI]  
It's time for something—  
It's time for something— (Pah-pah-pah, shit)  
It's time for something— ($oho)  
It's time for something—, it's time for something—  
Time for something to change
