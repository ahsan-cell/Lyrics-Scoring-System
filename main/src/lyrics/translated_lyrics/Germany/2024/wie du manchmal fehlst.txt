**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Zartmann]  
Okay  
Mh-mh, yeah-yeah  
Yeah, mh  

[Hook: Zartmann]  
I’ve written you songs, a stack of texts under my bed  
Maybe I’ll throw them away, don’t ask me what they’re about  
Because everything I write, I’ve lived through it all  
It’s about the big city, some drugs, and how you sometimes feel far away  
I’m often on the go, sticking my head out, feeling the wind  
I could tell you a lot, but I wouldn’t know who’d care  
So I put all the truth into the lines, and sometimes  
I imagine how you hear it, and then I fall asleep  

[Part: Ski Aggu]  
On the train with my crew  
I’m laughing, making noise  
And when I’m alone, I’m very quiet  
Feeling a bit sad, wondering what you’re up to  
I write you a message, but I don’t send it  
Because that would be so irresponsibly  
And unfair to my bros  
Because then I’d just chill on my phone until I get a reply  

[Pre-Hook: Ski Aggu]  
And besides, you only live once  
So I’m done with the whining now  
Club night is hot, we’re celebrating  
Everyone’s taking pills, and I’m joining in  
I’ve been rich for a few months now  
But I feel so poor without you in my life  
I’m a rapper, and it would be cool  
If your friends showed you this song, Aggu  

[Hook: Zartmann]  
I’ve written you songs, a stack of texts under my bed  
Maybe I’ll throw them away, don’t ask me what they’re about  
Because everything I write, I’ve lived through it all  
It’s about the big city, some drugs, and how you sometimes feel far away  
I’m often on the go, sticking my head out, feeling the wind  
I could tell you a lot, but I wouldn’t know who’d care  
So I put all the truth into the lines, and sometimes  
I imagine how you hear it, and then I fall asleep  

[Outro: Zartmann]  
(Mh-mh-mh)  
(Mh-mh-mh)
