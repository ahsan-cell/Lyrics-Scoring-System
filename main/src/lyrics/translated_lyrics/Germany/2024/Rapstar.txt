**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1: Amo & Nimo]  
I’ll tell you about what I feel  
Share stories from the past  
Represent my city from a stage  
Forget colleagues, I only save my brothers  
Three-eight-five, my city, Habib  
In this game like a straight-A student  
Balling like Thierry Henry  
Champions League top scorer, I remain the leader  
Though Mahall hinders my journey  
From fine crystal and hostage trembling  
To diamond glitter, pure fate  
No hipstars, we stay ninjas  
Rhymes spitter, sharing rooms  
No singles, no rich kids  
Old friends find me cooler today, Sa7bi, than an ice storm  
We may be trapped in the hood  
But we still stumble around when it rains  
I walk alone and breathe the air  
Look, the kids have no manners at all  
Years later, everyone’s on something here  
Stacking, collecting cases and problems  
Perpetrators carry guns for protection  
And they go over corpses for cash (Ah, ah)  

[Hook: Nimo & Amo]  
No job, no meat, just bread  
What’s enough? My money, it’s just enough (Just enough)  
Mama was a single parent  
Not easy for her, not easy for us (Not easy for us)  
I’ll never forget any of my boys (No, no)  
I’ll take you all with me, no matter how far we go  
(I’m now) Rapstar, Rapstar, Rapstar  
No job, no meat, just bread  
What’s enough? My money, it’s just enough (Just enough)  
Mama was a single parent  
Not easy for her, not easy for us (Not easy for us)  
I’ll never forget any of my boys (No, no)  
I’ll take you all with me, no matter how far we go  
(I’m now) Rapstar, Rapstar, Rapstar (Ahh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah)  

[Part 2: Amo & Nimo]  
Yesterday a dealer, get out, şev baş  
Today a money maker, Rapstar, ah (Ahh, yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Yesterday a dealer, today a money maker, Rapstar  
Oh no, cops are coming, run  
Ah, my legs have turbo  
Taking eight around the clock  
Because we leave no trace  
The police lurk in the Touareg (Cha-tfuh), vaffanculo  
Fuck, he smells my La-Mousse scent, bloodhound, Puto  
Stealing basement bikes, today a hitmaker in Aleman  
Bricks in my journey are now bricks in my accessories  
High, smoking Amnesia  
Hits bring in at Idéal  
Ahh, ahh, ahh (Ah, ah)  

[Hook: Nimo]  
No job, no meat, just bread  
What’s enough? My money, it’s just enough (Just enough)  
Mama was a single parent  
Not easy for her, not easy for us (Not easy for us)  
I’ll never forget any of my boys (No, no)  
I’ll take you all with me, no matter how far we go  
(I’m now) Rapstar, Rapstar, Rapstar  
No job, no meat, just bread  
What’s enough? My money, it’s just enough (Just enough)  
Mama was a single parent  
Not easy for her, not easy for us (Not easy for us)  
I’ll never forget any of my boys (No, no)  
I’ll take you all with me, no matter how far we go  
(I’m now) Rapstar, Rapstar, Rapstar
