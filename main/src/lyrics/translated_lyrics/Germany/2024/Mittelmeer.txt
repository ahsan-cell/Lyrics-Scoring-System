**[Intro]**  
(Stickle)

**[Hook]**  
I wish we could be again, like we used to be  
With you, driving to the Mediterranean without a license, carefree  
Yeah, I forget a lot, but surely not your name  
But maybe it’s just not meant to be, we really don’t fit the same  
I wish we could be again, like we used to be  
With you, driving to the Mediterranean without a license, carefree  
Windows down, cruising along the coast  
I know I’ll see you again, if only I knew when the most  

**[Part 1]**  
From Berlin-Kreuzberg to Italy in just one night  
Steering the car on the highway towards your city, feeling right  
Crossing borders through the Alps, listening to “Three Investigators”*  
And the landscape changes, as if it’s different seasons later  
You text: “How long till you’re here?” I send you my live location  
Speeding two hundred through the Brenner, our playlist in rotation  
So much we’ve experienced, years play out in my mind  
Without you, I feel so poor, even though I’ve got a loft to find  
Long night, I’m out and about, seeing the first light of dawn  
Wondering where I can smoke and grab a coffee to carry on  
Dawn breaks, exit, roadside café, espresso in hand  
Cali and ciabatta, filling up the tank at Esso, I planned  

**[Hook]**  
I wish we could be again, like we used to be  
With you, driving to the Mediterranean without a license, carefree  
Yeah, I forget a lot, but surely not your name  
But maybe it’s just not meant to be, we really don’t fit the same  
I wish we could be again, like we used to be  
With you, driving to the Mediterranean without a license, carefree  
Windows down, cruising along the coast  
I know I’ll see you again, if only I knew when the most  

**[Part 2]**  
Turning off towards the coast, seeing the sea after so long  
That’s why I prefer driving my car instead of flying along  
But no matter where I go, I miss my town  
My friends, my street, my neighborhood, my crew around  
Drive mode: Sport Plus, baby, I’m in a rush  
And she texts: “Don’t drive too fast,” but that’s just how I crush  
Our life is crazy, none of us sit at a desk  
Stopping in a small town, meet a guy, have a chat, what’s next?  
But then straight back on, can’t wait to see your face  
I turn into your street, bringing the car to a halt in place  
Under a Gucci umbrella, lying with you on the sand  
On my phone, sunglasses on, texting with my supplier, planned  

**[Hook]**  
I wish we could be again, like we used to be  
With you, driving to the Mediterranean without a license, carefree  
Yeah, I forget a lot, but surely not your name  
But maybe it’s just not meant to be, we really don’t fit the same  
I wish we could be again, like we used to be  
With you, driving to the Mediterranean without a license, carefree  
Windows down, cruising along the coast  
I know I’ll see you again, if only I knew when the most
