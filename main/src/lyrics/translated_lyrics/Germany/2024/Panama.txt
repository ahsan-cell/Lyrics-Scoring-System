**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Oh, oh, oh)

[Hook]  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further

[Part 1]  
I think of you, and it's constant  
For you, I burn, naturally  
Yes, the world with you is endless  
Yes, I know you inside and out  
Because you are home, and I know that  
I love you and soon we'll marry  
I'll hold your hand, even in the delivery room  
What we have was inevitable

[Pre-Hook]  
We're fluttering now (fluttering now)  
Both heading to Panama (Panama)  
A thousand km/h  
Eating baklava along the way

[Hook]  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further

[Part 2]  
How can someone look so perfect?  
Your aura shines, as if the sun is rising  
Come on, let’s go out, life is waiting  
Chardonnay and edamame  
I want to be with you, babe, on an island  
Discover every corner with you  
You are color, and I am the brush  
Come, let’s paint life simply

[Pre-Hook]  
We're fluttering now (fluttering now)  
Both heading to Panama (Panama)  
A thousand km/h  
Eating baklava along the way

[Hook]  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further

[Bridge]  
We're fluttering now  
To Panama (fluttering now)  
A thousand km/h  
The water is clear

[Hook]  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further  
Since I saw you  
Nothing is as it was  
You are art, my mandala  
I'm in love, to the max, it can't go any further

[Outro]  
We're fluttering now  
To Panama  
A thousand km/h  
The water is clear
