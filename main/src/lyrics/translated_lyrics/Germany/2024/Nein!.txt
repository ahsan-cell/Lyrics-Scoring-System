**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
If you leave now, never to return  
Then I know one thing  
I wouldn’t cry, I wouldn’t cry  
I wouldn’t cry (Mh, mh)  
I miss nothing that you are not  
You make it easy  
I’m not sorry, I’m not sorry  
I’m not sorry  

[Chorus]  
Go, with whoever you want, I don’t care  
It doesn’t bother me, I think I  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you anymore  
Don’t love you anymore, uhh  
Write to whoever you like, if you want  
I’ll be happy for you, I think I  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you anymore  
Don’t love you anymore, ohh  

[Verse 2]  
How nice it would be if you were gone  
Take everything with you, seriously  
Oh baby, don’t you know  
That in the end, you’ll miss me more? Mh (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah), hm  
Did it hurt you? No!  
Did you cry? No!  
Was I ever yours? No!  
Should I forgive?  
Oh baby, don’t you know  
That in the end, you’ll miss me more? (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)  

[Chorus]  
Go, with whoever you want, I don’t care  
It doesn’t bother me, I think I  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you anymore  
Don’t love you anymore, uhh  
Write to whoever you like, if you want  
I’ll be happy for you, I think I  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you anymore  
Don’t love you anymore, ohh  

[Bridge]  
Even if I forgive you  
And stay with you again  
I’d never be yours  
Um, it doesn’t hurt me anymore, because I  

[Outro]  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you anymore  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you—  
Don’t love you anymore, don’t love you anymore  
Don’t love you anymore, ahh
