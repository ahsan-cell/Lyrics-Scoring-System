**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook: Mali]  
Blaq on Blaq (Blaq), back to back  
Cruisin' through the city in a Cadillac  
Backseat right like the president  
Get rich or die tryin' like 50 Cent  
Blaq on Blaq (Blaq), stack on stack  
New pack when my Mindi's in the belly  
HoodBlaq goes left, right Big Racks  
Forget rap, German rappers just chit-chat  

[Part 1: Alim]  
Dry sift, commercial, La Mousse (Cash)  
She wants my money, but I’m not giving up (Hahaha)  
Walk just one day in my shoes (Gang)  
U-u-and you’ll freak out from Saruchs (Bow, bow, bow, bow)  
Customers stick like they’re on withdrawal (Yeah, bang)  
Rising sales, I’m on balloons (Bang)  
Every day’s hustle, not a day to rest (Hah)  
Forget the baddie on Majoun (Gang, Gang)  
Boxes of Haze (Bow) and boxes of Cali (Bow)  
I pull a few lines (Yeah), she pops a Xanny (Yeah)  
Abiat, flex is gone, mon chéri (Bow, bow, bow)  
On the street in joggers, we come too heavy (Gang, Gang, Gang)  
Forget observation, heal customers, supply Müşteris (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
She likes unregistered in the belly (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Making love, taking a few grand on credit (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Part 2: Mali]  
HoodBlaq, movies  
We’re the reason cops are busy with cases (Gang, Gang)  
Blood gone before my blade  
Whole gang pulls up and I’ve got an extended clip (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
You can't mess with the Malis  
Pussy, otherwise you’ll end up like Pop Smoke (Brr, bow)  
Back then in the park with a few Gs (Gang, Gang)  
Today I reject the cover of Vogue (Gang, Gang)  
Spinning your block with the real ones (Bow)  
Swallow my bullets, welcome to the West (Bow, bow)  
La-la-let them with two hundred wounds  
Investigations running, the perpetrator long gone  
Rounds in a blood frenzy, let my anger out (Ey)  
No evidence found (Minyak, minyak, minyak)  
My lawyer says it looks good (Gang)  
Phones have been sunk in the Rhine for too long (Bow, bow, bow)  

[Hook: Mali & Luciano]  
Blaq on Blaq (Blaq), back to back  
Cruisin' through the city in a Cadillac (Negro)  
Backseat right like the president  
Get rich or die tryin' like 50 Cent (Woah, woah)  
Blaq on Blaq (Blaq), stack on stack  
New pack when my Mindy’s in the belly (Yeah)  
HoodBlaq goes left, right Big Racks  
Forget rap, German rappers just chit-chat  

[Part 3: Luciano]  
Still got boys in the crew, shooting and stabbing for Loco, Habibi (Woah)  
Coming with a sharp katana for you and a sharp nine-milli for the back (Woah, woah)  
Loco has power, twenty-two shots, look, the shooter pays  
Old scars from back then, a slap from back then, man, talk sense, still hungry (Shawty)  
Broke the windows of the gas station with five-kilo hammers for quick dinero (Flex)  
Go ask the cousins on the street, Loco was really active in the bando (Woah)  
Drunk in Barcelona, Lucio Casanova, hiding under the sofa for the Hak each month  
You remember, I’m a street kid, it’s in me, pulling an extendo clip (Woah)  
Blaq on Blaq, back to back  
Cruisin' through the city in a Cullinan  
Up and down like a president  
Richard Mille black, all real  
You can't mess with them locos, pussy  
Otherwise, you’ll end up in a trunk  
Still real in my circle (Woah, woah, woah, woah)  
Still at night in my closet (Extendo-clip)  

[Hook: Mali]  
Blaq on Blaq (Blaq), back to back  
Cruisin' through the city in a Cadillac  
Backseat right like the president  
Get rich or die tryin' like 50 Cent  
Blaq on Blaq (Blaq), stack on stack  
New pack when my Mindi's in the belly
