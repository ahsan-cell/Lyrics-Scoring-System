**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]  
You should have been taken away by now  
But they forgot to come for you  
You're a party girl living just fine  
Until no one cares about your new style anymore  
All to say that  
I hope you're doing well  
But you are the reason  
And no one blames you  
But what about your silent betrayal?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]  
And for those two weeks, we were together forever  
A few times I ran into you, asking casually about the weather  
Now you're in the backyard, turning into the good neighbor  
Your wife is watering flowers, I want to kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]  
My mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February  
I took a miraculous pill to move on, but its effects are only temporary  
And I love you, the kind of love that's ruining my life  
I love you, the kind of love that's ruining my life  
I touched you in just two weeks  
I touched you, but I was with you  

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]  
And for those two weeks, we were together  
A few times I ran into you, casually complimenting your shirt  
Now you're at the mailbox, turning into the good neighbor  
My husband is cheating, I want to kill him  

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]  
I love you, the kind of love that's ruining my life  
I love you, the kind of love that's ruining my life  
I touched you in just two weeks  
I touched you, I touched you  
I love you, the kind of love that's ruining my life  
I love you, the kind of love that's ruining my life  
I touched you in just two weeks  
I touched you, I touched you  

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]  
Thinking about calling you, but you won't pick up  
Another two weeks lost in the land of the free  
Moved to Florida, bought the car I like  
But it won't start until I touch, touch, touch you  
Thinking about calling you, but you won't pick up  
Another two weeks lost in the land of the free  
Moved to Florida, bought the car I like  
But it won't start until I touch, touch, touch you
