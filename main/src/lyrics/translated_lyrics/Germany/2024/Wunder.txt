**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: AYLIVA]  
Hopefully  
She doesn't look like me  
Doesn't like what I like  
Doesn't talk all day  
Does she know that you think of me?  
Does she believe she knows you well?  
Mh-hm, she remains a stranger to you  
She remains a stranger to you  

[Pre-Chorus: AYLIVA]  
Was it just a one-night stand  
Or do you think she's fighting for you?  
Please don't act in love if you don't love her  
I don't believe a word you say because you always lie  
When will she know this? Tell me, when?  
That you can't forget me yet  
When will she know this? Tell me, when?  
Tell me, when?  

[Chorus: AYLIVA]  
I know that you're always alone  
No matter who occupies you right now  
And every time you go home  
I know exactly that you miss me  
When you come back, I won't be surprised, surprised then  
I won't be surprised, surprised then  
I won't be surprised, surprised then, surprised then  

[Verse 2: Apache 207, Apache 207 & AYLIVA]  
Please don't be surprised  
The red lipstick is from another woman  
No sorrow in sight, far and wide  
Because what we had was real  
But just a bad dream at night  
Baby, I'm cold  
Yeah, she's lying in my arms  
Why isn't it getting warm? Damn  
Eh-heh, it's always the same  
Oh, baby, day in, day out  
I'm parked again in some driveway  
The white Lambo stands in front of a black house  
And now don't ask if she can give the same as you gave me  
With you, I fly too high, with you, I fall too deep, this is too intense  

[Pre-Chorus: AYLIVA]  
Was it just a one-night stand  
Or do you think she's fighting for you?  
Please don't act in love if you don't love her  
I don't believe a word you say because you always lie  
When will she know this? Tell me, when?  
That you can't forget me yet  
When will she know this? Tell me, when?  
Tell me, when?  

[Chorus: Apache 207, AYLIVA & Both]  
It might be true that I'm alone  
No matter who occupies me right now  
But every time you went home  
I knew exactly that you were missing here  
When you come back, I won't be surprised, surprised then  
I won't be surprised, surprised then  
I won't be surprised, surprised then, surprised then  
I know that you're always alone  
No matter who occupies you right now  
And every time you go home  
I know exactly that you miss me  
When you come back, I won't be surprised, surprised then  
I won't be surprised, surprised then  
I won't be surprised, surprised then, surprised then  

[Outro: AYLIVA, AYLIVA & Apache 207]  
Ahh, ahh  
Ah-ah-ahh, ahh  
Ahh, ahh  
(When you come back, I won't be surprised, surprised then)  
(I won't be surprised, surprised then)  
Ah-ah-ahh, ahh
