**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Bonez MC & Trettmann]  
Mm-mh  
Yeah, I'm feeling it  
Yeah, I'm feeling it, not just a little out of it  
Take the vodka away from him, he didn't even pay for it  
Losing my face again, but I don't care  
'Cause I'm feeling it  

[Part 1: Bonez MC]  
No, no day like any other day  
Yeah, dude, today has to escalate  
Mhh, what the hell? The Very Hungry Caterpillar  
I'm ready to embarrass myself again  
About as much as Michael Jackson, I dance all night long  
And then sleep under Certain Circumstances on your balcony  
I'm someone, yeah, but sheâ€™s come ten times  
And the more hunters, the better the song, yeah  

[Hook: Bonez MC]  
Yeah, I'm feeling it, not just a little out of it  
Take the vodka away from him, he didn't even pay for it  
Losing my face again, but I don't care, la-la  
'Cause I'm feeling it  

[Part 2: Trettmann]  
Drinks as cold as winter  
We won't get any younger today  
Like the tracksuit shines in black light  
Where we come from is dark  
Her first time in Berlin (Berlin)  
I think she can't speak German (German)  
Dancing on the floor, John Travolta, Uma Thurman  
Whole head goes whap-whap, Skillibeng  
The party ain't over (Ain't over)  
Four AM in the minivan  
But the driver is still sober  
Mixing white rum with boom (Boom)  
Teleporting me to the moon (Moon)  
Idiots have no interest in anything  
But I have nothing to do with that  
'Cause I'm feeling it (Feeling it)  

[Hook: Bonez MC & Trettmann]  
Not just a little out of it  
Take the vodka away from him, he didn't even pay for it (Didn't even pay)  
Losing my face again, but I don't care, la-la (I don't care)  
'Cause I'm feeling it
