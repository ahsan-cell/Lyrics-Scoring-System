**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Theo Hutchcraft]  
(Hey, SIRA)  
Don't let go  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life  

[Hook: Theo Hutchcraft & Luciano]  
Don't let go (Boh-boh-boh-boh-boh-boh)  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life (Brr)  
Don't let go (Mwuah, buddy)  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life (Boom, bah)  

[Part 1: Luciano]  
Stay on course, look, the night is my day, 'cause I love this life we're living (Yeah)  
Rolls-Royce truck, but my heart's still here, 'cause I stay humble for life (Buddy)  
A girl gives head and the other one shakes, look, I'm starting with Two Girls New Year (Mwuah)  
High in my penthouse, living my best in tracksuit from 6 PM (Grr)  
My brother, look, life is short, think of your dream and run  
Stay away from negative people, keep your path moving forward  
Believe me, your life is too short (Ah), to see beautiful things  
Get your happiness, nothing comes easy, so keep your path moving forward  

[Pre-Hook: Luciano]  
Baby, come, take a step  
Baby, come, find your freedom  
Wonderful life, look, I'm living my dream, everything fought for myself  
Life is a masterpiece  
Search for your way up  
Find your happiness, my beautiful girl, 'cause honey, your life is too short  

[Hook: Theo Hutchcraft & Luciano]  
Don't let go (Boh-boh-boh-boh-boh-boh)  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life (Brr)  
Don't let go (Mwuah, buddy)  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life (Boom, bah)  

[Part 2: Luciano]  
Back then hiding in the block  
Too much in my head, feeling down (Brr)  
Today in Bagatelle (Mwuah)  
Too many girls around me  
Too hot, just for me only  
Give a damn what the opp-boy thinks  
Bro, look ahead and fulfill your dream  
Energy is coming, so follow your instincts (Brr)  
I'm not done yet (Nah-ah), gimme more blessings  
Still hungry for stacks and too many vibes to catch  
Iâ€™m still not done, gimme more blessings  
Still hungry for stacks and too many vibes to catch  

[Pre-Hook: Luciano & Theo Hutchcraft]  
Baby, come, take a step  
Baby, come, find your freedom  
Wonderful life, look, I'm living my dream, everything fought for myself  
Life is a masterpiece (Don't let go)  
Search for your way up  
Find your happiness, my beautiful girl, 'cause honey, your life is too short (Never give up, it's such a wonderful life)  

[Hook: Theo Hutchcraft & Luciano]  
Don't let go (Boh-boh-boh-boh-boh-boh)  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life (Brr)  
Don't let go (Mwuah, buddy)  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life (Boom, bow)  
Don't let go  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life  
Don't let go  
Never give up, it's such a wonderful life
