**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1: Bonez MC]  
The little sons of bitches rap with arrogance  
Spitting big words, but hiding in the closet  
Hey, all your whores eat from your hand  
Go buy her a thousand roses, but she tastes like my dick (Yeah)  
My old TV is already out on the trash  
Because I have too much money now and can buy what I want (Everything)  
No new friends means we don’t need to chill (No)  
Please shut your mouth and step out of your movie  
They start to hate because they’re slowly getting bitter (Ohh)  
Drunk, you’re causing waves, but eventually, you’ll be sober  
Three days in jail and they start to chirp  
Start to tremble because they’re scared of the judge (Oh)  
Meanwhile, I’m lying naked in my garden smoking weed  
The cops are hating, but the street loves me  
Party in Ibiza, then I sleep in Paris, hey  
The sun is shining, a new day in paradise  

[Hook: Bonez MC]  
Look, we’re rolling through the neighborhood  
Whole joint full of weed  
Millionaire, millionaire, millionaire  
And we want you to see  
So much gold and platinum  
Millionaire, millionaire, millionaire (Na-na-na)  

[Part 2: Gzuz]  
They’ve tried everything, but they’re not talented (Nah)  
And they fly high because their backs are motivated  
They shout, “I’ll make a clip in front of your door”  
But they don’t dare to come to the block because they know what happens (Pam)  
Who hangs with bitches like tampons?  
And who still takes the risk? (We)  
I don’t care about anything because I’ll soon be a millionaire  
I have a name and I hold it in honor (Wouh)  
G-Z-U-Z, this shit is real (Eh)  
I’ve got a lead syringe for little sons of bitches  
They talk so much, but it’s becoming clear (Huh?)  
Most of what gangster rappers say isn’t true  
Pockets stuffed, so much cash in my jeans  
Smash the bottle on your head, come on, let’s roll through the neighborhood (Wouh)  
Close your eyes and tell me what you see (What?)  
The sun is shining, a new day in paradise  

[Hook: Bonez MC]  
Look, we’re rolling through the neighborhood  
Whole joint full of weed  
Millionaire, millionaire, millionaire  
And we want you to see  
So much gold and platinum  
Millionaire, millionaire, millionaire  

[Outro: Bonez MC]  
Na-na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na  
Na-na-na, na-na-na
