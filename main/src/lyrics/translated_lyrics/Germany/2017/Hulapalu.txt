**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain]  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odie  

[Verse 1]  
Happy hour in the night  
Sexy, everyone dances, everyone laughs  
Forty degrees on the dance floor  
“Hulapalu,” you whisper in my ear  
What is Hulapalu? What’s it all about?  
Should we maybe close our eyes during Hulapalu?  
Can we see the stars during Hulapalu?  
Tell me, how does that work?  

[Refrain]  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odie  

[Refrain 2]  
“You!” you said, and “Phew!” I thought  
What are you doing to me when you laugh just for me?  
You and I, and only the moon is watching  
Then you say: “Hulapalu!”  

[Post-Refrain]  
Hulapalu  
Hulapalu  

[Verse 2]  
What is Hulapalu? Tell me, where does it come from?  
How do you spell Hulapalu? What is that, pray tell?  
I think Hulapalu isn’t quite suitable for kids  
You just say: “What’s wrong with that?”  

[Refrain]  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odie  

[Refrain 2]  
“You!” you said, and “Phew!” I thought  
What are you doing to me when you laugh just for me?  
You and I, and only the moon is watching  
Then you say: “Hulapalu!”  
“You!” you said, and “Phew!” I thought  
What are you doing to me when you laugh just for me?  
You and I, and only the moon is watching  
Then you say: “Hulapalu!”  

[Refrain]  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie (Hulapalu)  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odi-odie  
Hodi-odi-odie
