**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Almaz (FC Bayern Munich)  
Yeah (Ah)  

[Part 1]  
Check, sunglasses like Stevie Wonder  
Every day feels like a Sunday now  
Dance left, right like Van Damme  
Ret, buddy, buddy, bam-bam  
With the crew at the minibar  
Bang-bang, run, we’re illegal  
Illegal from the block to a Lambo  
Ah-yah-yeh, Coco Jamboo  
Luxury is soothing  
How am I doing? Hamdulillah, very well  
Ah, take a sip of that Hennessy  
And smile at the camera like Kennedy  
Ah, man, I even make money in Habs  
From the old generation, Bugs Bunny  
(Man, I even make money in Habs)  
(From the old generation, Bugs Bunny)  

[Pre-Hook]  
Flashlight when I walk into the party  
Kim Kardashians pulling on the Davidoff  
I’m a Kanake, not a Gringo  
Hand me my drink, it’s all good  
No time for counting days  
Because only your actions count  
There’s no other way  
So ándale, ándale  

[Hook]  
Amsterdam, ya salam, ya salam  
Paris, ya salam, ya salam  
Berlin, ya salam, ya salam  
Brussels, ya salam, ya salam  
Frankfurt, ya salam, ya salam  
Hamburg, ya salam, ya salam  
Ah, do the Ribéry dance  
I greet the slums, ya salam, ya salam  

[Part 2]  
I’m grown now, a man like Vito  
Dancing in the video like Al Pacino  
Yeah, man, I don’t care about beauty contests  
The woman I’m looking for is sitting  
In a Benz in a parking lot in front of a fast food  
And singing “I Need a Girl, Pt. 2”  
Should I introduce myself? The captain of the team  
I steer the game like Franck Ribéry  
Why do I rap? My intention is purple  
And a girl who dances like Shakira  
(Why do I rap? My intention is purple)  
(And a girl who dances like Shakira)  

[Pre-Hook]  
Flashlight when I walk into the party  
Kim Kardashians pulling on the Davidoff  
I’m a Kanake, not a Gringo  
Hand me my drink, it’s all good  
No time for counting days  
Because only your actions count  
There’s no other way  
So ándale, ándale  

[Hook]  
Amsterdam, ya salam, ya salam  
Paris, ya salam, ya salam  
Berlin, ya salam, ya salam  
Brussels, ya salam, ya salam  
Frankfurt, ya salam, ya salam  
Hamburg, ya salam, ya salam  
Ah, do the Ribéry dance  
I greet the slums, ya salam, ya salam  

[Bridge]  
We set the trends  
We’re ex-criminals  
A gang like Looney Tunes  
No friendship with Scooby-Doos  
We’re old crooks  
Wanting to rise to the top  
So dance, Amore  
We have no worries anymore  

[Pre-Hook]  
Amsterdam, ya salam, ya salam  
Paris, ya salam, ya salam  
Berlin, ya salam, ya salam  
Brussels, ya salam, ya salam  
Frankfurt, ya salam, ya salam  
Hamburg, ya salam, ya salam  
Ah, do the Ribéry dance  
I greet the slums, ya salam, ya salam  

[Hook]
