**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I'm trying to put you in the worst mood, oh  
My P1 is cleaner than your church shoes, oh  
A point I gave him was just to hurt you, two million dollars, oh  
All my Lamborghinis are just to piss you off, oh  
None of these cars are rented, oh  
I make your annual income in a week, oh  
My first side chick isn't in your league, oh  
My second side chick isn't in your league either, oh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The house is so empty, something's needed in the middle  
So I put a twenty-thousand-dollar table made of ebony wood  
Baby, she's sorting out the cocaine on that table  
Then she cleans it with her nose, man, I love my baby  
You always talk about your money, you need a hearing aid  
You're talking about me, I can't see a shadow on me  
I change my style, I can fit into any shape  
I refresh my drink, I ease every pain  

[Chorus]  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  

[Verse 2]  
Every day some dude is trying to test me, oh  
Every day some dude is trying to bring me down, oh  
I'm in my Roadster SV, pulled over to the side, oh  
My pockets are so full, they're getting heavy, oh  
You're following the king, that's a long way for you, oh  
I come to life in the fall, oh  
I don't compete with anyone, I never listen  
In my blue Mulsanne, I'm playing New Edition  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The house is so empty, something's needed in the middle  
So I put a twenty-thousand-dollar table made of ebony wood  
Baby, she's sorting out the cocaine on that table  
Then she cleans it with her nose, man, I love my baby  
You always talk about your money, you need a hearing aid  
You're talking about me, I can't see a shadow on me  
I change my style, I can fit into any shape  
I refresh my drink, I ease every pain  

[Chorus]  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  

[Verse 3]  
Leave Brad Pitt alone, man  
Legend of the Fall took over just like a bandit  
I bought my mom a new house and a brand new Mercedes  
She looks extravagant when she goes to the market  
My car has a roof like in Star Trek II  
Girls go crazy when they hear this song  
The 100 on the speedometer brings me closer to God  
We don't pray for love, we only pray for cars  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The house is so empty, something's needed in the middle  
So I put a twenty-thousand-dollar table made of ebony wood  
Baby, she's sorting out the cocaine on that table  
Then she cleans it with her nose, man, I love my baby  
You always talk about your money, you need a hearing aid  
You're talking about me, I can't see a shadow on me  
I change my style, I can fit into any shape  
I refresh my drink, I ease every pain  

[Chorus]  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy  
Look at what you're doing  
I'm a damn Starboy
