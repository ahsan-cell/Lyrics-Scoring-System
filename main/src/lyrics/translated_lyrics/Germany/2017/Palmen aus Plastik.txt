**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: RAF Camora]  
Under plastic palms  
By a sea of gasoline  
No sand, but it’s alright  
Riding rounds on my scooter  
It gets a bit cold when night falls  
I burn my weed  
Under plastic palms  

[Part 1: Bonez MC]  
Summer  
Above the rooftops of my city, the air smells like marijuana  
The Benz freshly washed, baby, scent of coconut  
A thousand photos in a haze, what a career (Yeah)  
High today, tomorrow we’ll be millionaires (Haha)  
Five hundred horses, I gaze at the stars (Boh)  
Sending greetings to my boys far away  
Haramburger district, sun from the tube  
Fake fingernails and skin color like a carrot  
My world is made of plastic, but that’s okay, I’d still be  
187 if this hype didn’t exist anymore (You bastards)  
She brings me cornflakes and croissants to bed  
Again, she leaves me no choice (Haha)  
And all the neighbors hear us during sex  
But I don’t care at all  

[Hook: RAF Camora]  
I hang out in my hood  
Under plastic palms  
By a sea of gasoline  
No sand, but it’s alright  
Riding rounds on my scooter  
It gets a bit cold when night falls  
I burn my weed  
Under plastic palms  

[Part 2: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]  
Summer  
Above the rooftops of my city, the air smells like marijuana  
The Alfa matte black like the ravens in the sky  
The sun shines behind the skyline like never at Ballermann*  
When it gets hot, Berlin becomes my Panama  
I’ve got all of Vienna behind me like David Alaba  
Instead of hanging with Vatos Locos, I chill with Arabs  
Plastic palms (Ah), the girls are made of silicone  
R-A, Vienna, Ghost, right at the top of the building (Boh, boh, boh)  
Chilling on the balcony, smoking blunts and dreaming  
My sea sounds like engine noises (Brr)  
I only live my dream when it’s real  
There are a thousand movies on Netflix (Ey)  
The sun makes the skin brown like Nesquik (Ahh)  
Countdown to the future, Camora is finally alive  

[Hook: RAF Camora]  
I hang out in my hood  
Under plastic palms  
By a sea of gasoline  
No sand, but it’s alright  
Riding rounds on my scooter  
It gets a bit cold when night falls  
I burn my weed  
Under plastic palms  

[Bridge: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]  
Summer  
Above the rooftops of my city, the air smells like marijuana  
Summer  
Above the rooftops of my city, the air smells like marijuana  

[Hook: RAF Camora]  
I hang out in my hood  
Under plastic palms  
By a sea of gasoline  
No sand, but it’s alright  
Riding rounds on my scooter  
It gets a bit cold when night falls  
I burn my weed  
Under plastic palms  

[Outro: RAF Camora]  
(Under plastic palms)  
(By a sea of gasoline)  
(No sand, but it’s alright)  
(Riding rounds on my scooter)  
(It gets a bit cold when night falls)  
(I burn my weed)  
(Under plastic palms)
