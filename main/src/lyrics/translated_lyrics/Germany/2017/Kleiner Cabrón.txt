**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1]  
In my world, you're born with debts  
No school uniform, we wear Louis Vuitton  
Dealers with cash, Beamer and Benz  
Lilane's quick, Gina orders  
Once the boy that no one liked  
Now the bitches see me, pleasuring themselves  
The goods are cut, the scale is calibrated  
Yeah, we live the life of thieves  
Spent years in hardship, but now I make the dough  
And work like a machine  
No life under pressure, yeah, I go to the club  
And burn cash like chimneys  
The area’s broken, but I’ll take your jewels  
I’ll get what I deserve  
Bro, screw love, it just makes you weak, bro (it just makes you weak, bro)  
We rule the streets, just like Pablo (just like Pablo)  
No-go area, from Altendorf to Marxloh (from Altendorf to Marxloh)  
Gangster life, from the cradle to the grave, lo  

[Pre-Hook]  
Euro, dollar, ruble rollin' (ruble rollin')  
Through gangster rap and good buds (good buds)  
Mirror image, I'm self-absorbed (self-absorbed)  
It’s all about making money  

[Hook]  
Listen to me, listen to me, little Cabrón  
No stories, no sorries, no pardons  
Veysel Abi wants cash, call me Patrón  
Big family, call me Gotti, little Cabrón  
Listen to me, listen to me, little Cabrón  
No stories, no sorries, no pardons  
Veysel Abi wants cash, call me Patrón  
Big family, call me Gotti, little Cabrón  

[Post-Hook]  
Little Cabrón, little Cabrón  

[Part 2]  
Bela Boyz, Dicka, with a finger on the trigger  
I fuck your mothers, always a pirate (pirate)  
Piss on the bars, the judge  
And on all the other bastards, I fuck the state (eowa)  
Eating my life, my jersey is red (lo lo)  
I'm out here flipping the dope (lo lo)  
Still the same boy from Altendorf  
Living around the corner from Tipico  
They want the street, I’ll fuck them until they love me (until they love me)  
Knolle Haze, I’m flying again (I’m flying again)  
Veysi unique, there are so many of you (there are so many of you)  
Gun loaded, bro, believe me, I shoot  

[Pre-Hook]  
Euro, dollar, ruble rollin' (ruble rollin')  
Through gangster rap and good buds (good buds)  
Mirror image, I'm self-absorbed (self-absorbed)  
It’s all about making money  

[Hook]  
Listen to me, listen to me, little Cabrón  
No stories, no sorries, no pardons  
Veysel Abi wants cash, call me Patrón  
Big family, call me Gotti, little Cabrón  
Listen to me, listen to me, little Cabrón  
No stories, no sorries, no pardons  
Veysel Abi wants cash, call me Patrón  
Big family, call me Gotti, little Cabrón
