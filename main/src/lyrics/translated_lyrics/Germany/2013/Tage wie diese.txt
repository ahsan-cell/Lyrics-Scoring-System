**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I've been waiting for weeks for this day  
And I dance with joy over the asphalt  
As if there's a rhythm, as if there's a song  
That pulls me further through the streets  
I come to meet you, to pick you up, just like we planned  
At the same time, at the same meeting point as last time  

[Verse 2]  
Through the crowd, the throng of people  
We carve our way down the familiar path  
Along the alleys to the Rhine terraces  
Over the bridges, all the way to the music  
Where everything is loud, where everyone is in  
To let loose  
Where others wait to start with us  
And take off  

[Chorus]  
On days like these  
You wish for eternity  
On days like these  
We still have forever  
I wish for eternity  

[Verse 3]  
This is forever, forever for today  
We won't stand still for an entire night  
Come, I'll carry you through the crowd  
Don't be afraid, I'll look out for you  
We let ourselves drift, dive under  
Swimming with the current  
Spinning in circles, we can't come down  
We're weightless  

[Chorus]  
On days like these  
You wish for eternity  
On days like these  
We still have forever  
In this night of nights  
That promises us so much  
We experience the best  
No end is in sight  

[Post-Chorus]  
No end in sight  
No end in sight  
No end in sight  

[Chorus]  
On days like these  
You wish for eternity  
On days like these  
We still have forever  
In this night of nights  
That promises us so much  
We experience the best  
No end is in sight  
We experience the best  
And no end in sight  

[Outro]  
No end in sight
