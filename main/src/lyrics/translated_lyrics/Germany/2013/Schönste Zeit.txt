**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It was just you and me out there  
Wide fields and lakes, but nothing more  
It was 1994 and we didn’t know where to go  
So we went to your bed  
And we shared our Walkman  
The first beer, my moped, and the frustration  
In the night bus window, the moon  
The first kiss was strawberry punch and spit  
Like a Polaroid in the rain: slightly blurred  

[Chorus]  
That was the best time (the best time)  
Because everything began there (the best time)  
And Berlin was like New York  
A place miles away  
And your tears were eyeliner  
On the day Kurt Cobain died, you lay in my arms  
That was the best time (the best time)  
Because everything began there (the best time)  

[Verse 2]  
Your first tattoo was then the refrain:  
"It's better to burn out than to fade away - my my, hey hey"  
And I bought myself a Neil Young and a Nirvana shirt  
When you moved away later, I secretly fell apart  
I played guitar endlessly  
Cried on paper  
You were a Polaroid in the rain  
And my first song  

[Chorus]  
That was the best time (the best time)  
Because everything began there (the best time)  
And Berlin was like New York  
A place miles away  
And your tears were eyeliner  
On the day Kurt Cobain died,  
You lay in my arms  
That was the best time (the best time)  
(Hey hey, my my)  

[Bridge]  
What we can’t do  
Is repeat anything  
No moment, no instant  
Can ever be repeated  
What we can’t do  
Is repeat anything  
We can’t go back  
And why should we?  

[Chorus]  
That was the best time (the best time)  
Because everything began there (the best time)  
And Berlin was like New York  
A place miles away  
And your tears were eyeliner  
On the day Kurt Cobain died,  
You lay in my arms  
That was the best time (the best time)  

[Outro]  
Oh well, whatever, nevermind  
I dreamed of you last night  
And of the best time (the best time)  
Where everything began (the best time)
