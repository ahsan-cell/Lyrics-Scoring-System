**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Old friends meeting again after all these years  
We've all been through so much and we're still here  
In the pub at the corner of our first bar  
Does it still look the same as it did in the nineties?  
Some have stayed, coming here every night  
My first love seems far too refined for this  
We are really so different  
And I’ve come from far away today, our friendship remains  
For we share more than just memories  

[Chorus]  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, no one can take this from us  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, let’s raise our glasses high  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, no one can take this from us  
The city lights up and we drink to life  

[Verse 2]  
We’ve written on every wall that we were here  
And those moments remain, they can't be bought  
Every village and every bar we've seen together  
And when I talk about it tomorrow, it sounds like joy in life  

[Chorus]  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, no one can take this from us  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, let’s raise our glasses high  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, no one can take this from us  
The city lights up and we drink to life  

[Verse 3]  
And in the pub at the corner, the light still shines bright  
We drink schnapps, smoke cigarettes, and don’t change at all  
And in the pub at the corner, the light still shines bright, always bright, and it never changes  
No one can take this from us  

[Chorus]  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, no one can take this from us  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, let’s raise our glasses high  
Oooh-Oooh-Oooh-Oooh, no one can take this from us  
The city lights up and we drink to life  
Oooh  
Oooh  
Oooh  
It’s five in the morning and we drink to life
