**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1: Sido]  
Weathered and marked by life,  
Bitter and surrounded by temptations,  
Like behind bars, the same forever,  
Every step I take has caused me trouble.  
Sinking at night in a disgusting way,  
Almost drowning in a lake full of filth.  
No one took me along; I lacked maturity,  
But some stones just need to be polished.

[Pre-Hook: Sido]  
You came by, compass in hand,  
You saw that this one stone was special.  
You took it with you, didn’t sink it in the sea,  
Gave it a big warm place in your heart.

[Hook: Mark Forster]  
Do you remember the place where I waited for you?  
Side by side with the other stones, I lay there.  
I was cold, without a home, and all alone,  
Before you came, I was just one of those stones.  
I was so covered in dust before you found me,  
You set me in motion, finally gave me new energy.  
I was cold, petrified, and alone,  
Before you came, I was just one of those stones.  
Without a home and alone,  
Just one of those stones.

[Part 2: Sido]  
You build me up, lie down next to me,  
I can talk about everything with you,  
Or without words, just gesturing.  
Back then, I wouldn’t have understood any of this anyway.  
You led me to new paths,  
For the first time, I felt life.  
I know that such happiness doesn’t happen to everyone,  
I won’t leave anymore; I’m here just because of you.

[Pre-Hook: Sido]  
You came by, compass in hand,  
You saw that this one stone was special.  
You took it with you, didn’t sink it in the sea,  
Gave it a big warm place in your heart.

[Hook: Mark Forster]  
Do you remember the place where I waited for you?  
Side by side with the other stones, I lay there.  
I was cold, without a home, and all alone,  
Before you came, I was just one of those stones.  
I was so covered in dust before you found me,  
You set me in motion, finally gave me new energy.  
I was cold, petrified, and alone,  
Before you came, I was just one of those stones.

[Bridge: Mark Forster]  
I was just dusty, worn out, and without a plan,  
Before you came and took me with you.  
No one needs to save me anymore; you’ve already done that,  
By coming and taking me with you.

[Hook: Mark Forster]  
Do you remember the place where I waited for you?  
Side by side with the other stones, I lay there.  
I was cold, without a home, and all alone,  
Before you came, I was just one of those stones.  
I was so covered in dust before you found me,  
You set me in motion, finally gave me new energy.  
I was cold, petrified, and alone,  
Before you came, I was just one of those stones.  
Without a home and alone,  
Just one of those stones.  
Do you remember the place where I waited for you?
