**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Loredana]  
(Miksu)  
(Macloud, what a beat!)  
Hey  

[Hook: Loredana]  
Every time you tell me, "It's over,"  
I don't believe a word you say.  
'Cause I have what you want, and you know,  
There’s no second chance.  
I don’t believe a word you say,  
No second chance.  
I don’t believe a word you say.  

[Part 1: Loredana]  
How can someone hate like I hate you?  
You thought it would be a love song, but I’ll break your neck.  
You talk about the girls, but they support me.  
I’m going straight to gold, look, my success – no end in sight.  
Please don’t tell me you don’t need me anymore, baby.  
I’ll buy your car, your honor, and your house, baby.  
We both know exactly how good I look.  
Don’t play it cool, we both know the chat history, baby.  

[Hook: Juju]  
Every time you tell me, "It's over,"  
I don't believe a word you say.  
'Cause I have what you want, and you know,  
There’s no second chance.  
I don’t believe a word you say,  
No second chance.  
I don’t believe a word you say.  

[Part 2: Juju]  
Yeah, rest assured, I stay ice-cold.  
Even if you talk nonsense, saying you want to be alone.  
I say nothing, even though it messes with me, 'cause I don’t want a fight.  
I’m always on the go, not part-time.  
You know I’m savage; getting me was a challenge.  
Look at everything I manage, no life-work balance.  
Boy, don’t act all high and mighty, no, you know it gets dangerous.  
When you say you’ll end it, you’re not even honest (not even honest).  
No, I don’t need your money; I’ll buy the Gucci bag myself.  
Booked for a hundred K, Fendi, Louis – already ordered.  
Your talk can’t get me back into your bed.  
You want to break my wings so I can’t fly away, but…  

[Hook: Loredana & Juju]  
Every time you tell me, "It's over,"  
I don't believe a word you say.  
'Cause I have what you want, and you know,  
There’s no second chance.  
I don’t believe a word you say,  
No second chance.  
I don’t believe a word you say.
