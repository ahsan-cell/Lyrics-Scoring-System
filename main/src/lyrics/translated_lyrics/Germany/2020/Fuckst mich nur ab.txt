**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook]  
You just drive me crazy  
Can't stand to see your face, I'm leaving this town  
Someday you'll understand, man, you messed it up  
Believe me, no one will understand you like I did  
But you just didn't want to see it, now there's nothing left  

[Part 1]  
Tried a thousand times to talk to you  
But you never listened, you just don't get it  
I loved you with all my heart  
I see you don't care, and that hurts me  
We simply grew apart  
You've been on a different path for a long time  
Your so-called friends are all fake  
When you wake up, it'll be too late  
Never again as a pair, I'll do it alone  
Believe me, yeah, I'm sorry, but I won't let you back in  
Maybe I cried because you made it hard for me  
I meant well so many times, but I couldn't reach you  
Again you come from the side, starting fights for no reason  
Talking nonsense, pulling me into your swamp  
Stealing my time endlessly with your insults  
It's over for us both, you know why  

[Hook]  
You just drive me crazy  
Can't stand to see your face, I'm leaving this town  
Someday you'll understand, man, you messed it up  
Believe me, no one will understand you like I did  
But you just didn't want to see it, now there's nothing left  
Can't stand to see your face, I'm leaving this town  
Someday you'll understand, man, you messed it up  
Believe me, no one will understand you like I did  
But you just didn't want to see it, now there's nothing left (Hollywood)  

[Bridge]  
Oh no, you can't fool me  
Leaving all that time behind  
I'm so sorry, you lost me  
You'll soon wake up alone  

[Part 2]  
You knew: come what may  
I stood here all these years always behind you  
Call my number and I'll come  
Whether you were at fault or not, I didn't care  
No matter what  
You were lost, but you could count on me  
I worried, thought I could handle it  
But it didn't work out  

[Hook]  
You just drive me crazy  
Can't stand to see your face, I'm leaving this town  
Someday you'll understand, man, you messed it up  
Believe me, no one will understand you like I did  
But you just didn't want to see it, now there's nothing left  

[Outro]  
Oh no, you can't fool me  
Leaving all that time behind  
I'm so sorry, you lost me  
You'll wake up today, alone
