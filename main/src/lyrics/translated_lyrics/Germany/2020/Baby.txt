[Verse: Joker Bra]  
Baby, you know  
To me, you’ll always be the one  
We’re not pretending to be Bonnie and Clyde  
We’re on coke, Jacky, and ice  
I don’t care about the price  
Not about the clicks and the likes  
What’s all this hype?  
No matter what happens, I know you’ll stay  
Baby, you know  
To me, you’ll always be the one  
We’re not pretending to be Bonnie and Clyde  
We’re on coke, Jacky, and ice  
I don’t care about the price  
Not about the clicks and the likes  
What’s all this hype?  
No matter what happens, I know you’ll stay

Baby, we dance, na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na
