**Translated Lyrics:**

[Pre-Intro]  
Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no respect (-pect)  

[Intro]  
(young mesh makes the 808)  
Yeah  
(Juh-Juh-Dee on the beat)  
Wouh  

[Part 1]  
Stylish new trench coat, looks just like Kenzo  
Who gave it to you, or was it on sale, ho? (Wouh)  
Boy feels friend-zoned  
Wants the number from my cellphone (Brr)  
Like Naomi Campbell, the way I walk is disrespectful (Uhh)  
Dirty white bitches (Nah), whipping in a Mercedes-Benz (Uh)  
Candy paint Skittles (Skittles), sipping Alizé  
Banned from restaurants, we dance on the tables (Hah!)  
Everyone knows my name, but no one knows my story  
A woman with ambition, running her business, not gossip (Periodt)  
Through fake friends and money, I won’t lose control  
My ego weighs a ton, I post a story (Wouh)  
And female rappers push their albums back a week (Brrr)  

[Hook]  
Get out—Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no respect  
Get out—Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no respect (-pect)  

[Part 2]  
I’m big cinema (Wow) like an Apple Keynote (Wouh)  
On my feet, Bloody Shoes, I call them Tarantinos (Loubi)  
Mad bitch, Shego (Woah), string from Valentino (Mmh)  
Juicy Money CEO, Female Al Pacino (What?)  
“I-I-I’m not that kind of girl” – but yes, that’s exactly who I am (Woah)  
And it’s always been this way: if I want something, I get it  
You’re broke-ass hoes, I’m high-end finish (Finish)  
What you call image, we call cheap (Cheap)  
It’s kinda funny how you stumble on the catwalk  
And why does my second album already sound like my best-of?  
Baby-blue tracksuit and a white tank top  
Bitch, I'm in the kitchen, cooking heat, I’m the chef  

[Hook]  
Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no respect  
Get out—Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no—  

[Outro]  
Get out—Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no respect  
Get out—Get out from the back right, 90-60-111  
Juicy-, Juicy-Money-Checks, give that bitch no respect (-pect)
