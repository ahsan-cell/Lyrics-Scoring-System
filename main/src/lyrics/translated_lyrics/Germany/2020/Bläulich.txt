**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Juh-Juh-Dee on the beat)  
(young mesh makes the 808)

[Hook]  
We roll at night, the sky shimmers blue  
Apache stays the same, but not today  
She tells me she finds me so friendly  
Otherwise, she wouldn't be here, 'cause she's not for sale  
I gently press the gas pedal and she gets excited  
Slap 21 inches on my Benz  
Driving through the city, windows down  
Backstage is crawling with gangsters  
The DJ plays us "Rhythm Is a Dancer"

[Part 1]  
Police checkpoint, officer, you're mistaken  
The car is factory loud, you’re not dreaming  
AMG emblem, it’s clearly displayed  
Check the papers, convince yourself  
Rap battles on rooftops, Apache destroys  
Depending on the beat, the interior changes color  
Girls are watching us, they've heard about it  
I'm completely drunk, bro, I'm fully turned up  
30k on my arm while I drink Jägi-Cola  
Thought about it for so long, "Should I buy her or not?"  
Even though that’s clearly against my code  
Otherwise, you won’t earn respect in this upper class

[Hook]  
We roll at night, the sky shimmers blue  
Apache stays the same, but not today  
She tells me she finds me so friendly  
Otherwise, she wouldn't be here, 'cause she's not for sale  
I gently press the gas pedal and she gets excited  
Slap 21 inches on my Benz  
Driving through the city, windows down  
Backstage is crawling with gangsters  
The DJ plays us "Rhythm Is a Dancer"

[Part 2]  
Rappers tremble when Apache goes trap  
Beautiful woman next to me, one hand on the wheel  
She says, "Love me too," baby, I believe in it  
Stop it, I know you’re doing it on purpose  
Your ex promises you things, I know that guy lies  
Too sexy car, they should get out of the way, toot-toot  
Let’s go to the hotel room, there are plants blooming green  
Turn off your alarm, 'cause we’ll wake up to breakfast

[Bridge]  
Overpriced suite, what a cheek  
I shouldn’t even be in bed with her  
Take me home

[Hook]  
We roll at night, the sky shimmers blue  
Apache stays the same, but not today  
She tells me she finds me so friendly  
Otherwise, she wouldn't be here, 'cause she's not for sale  
I gently press the gas pedal and she gets excited  
Slap 21 inches on my Benz  
Driving through the city, windows down  
Backstage is crawling with gangsters  
The DJ plays us "Rhythm Is a Dancer"

[Outro]  
Take me home
