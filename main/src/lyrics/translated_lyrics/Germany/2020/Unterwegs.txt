**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
K-K-K-K  
K-K-K-K-KitschKrieg  

[Hook: Jamule]  
Everything feels like a dream, not thinking about tomorrow, hey  
Until the sun rises, we’re on our way  
Life wants to let loose, and we want to see it  
I’m sure none of us will sleep today  
Yeah, everything feels like a dream, not thinking about tomorrow, hey  
Until the sun rises, we’re on our way  
Life wants to let loose, and we want to see it  
I’m sure none of us will sleep today  

[Part 1: Jamule]  
Hey, yeah, we’re pushing everything to the next day (Hey)  
Just doing what you like today (Yeah)  
I brought a little love with me (Huh)  
Blowing smoke out of the sunroof (Pff)  
Capturing the moment on Polaroid (Flash)  
Staying low-key like Burna Boy  
Thoughts and senses are so numb (Yeah)  
Because yes, even Lucifer is our friend  
I know exactly what you’re searching for right now (Yeah, yeah)  
You and I know no taboos, no  
Too much of the high, too much of the Goose  
No matter what, take another hit, hey  

[Pre-Hook: Jamule]  
Are you ready?  
Just the two of us  
Completely high  
White wine  
That we share  
We are free  
Forget the time  

[Hook: Jamule]  
Everything feels like a dream, not thinking about tomorrow, hey  
Until the sun rises, we’re on our way  
Life wants to let loose, and we want to see it  
I’m sure none of us will sleep today  
Yeah, everything feels like a dream, not thinking about tomorrow, hey  
Until the sun rises, we’re on our way  
Life wants to let loose, and we want to see it  
I’m sure none of us will sleep today  

[Post-Hook: Jamule]  
Hey, in my wallet, I have something against our worries, hey  
In my wallet, I have something against our worries, hey  
In my wallet, I have something against our worries, hey  
No GPS, no one can track us  

[Part 2]  
You’re my Betty Boop (Boop)  
We’re like gin & juice (Ah)  
I ask you: “What do you want to do?”  
Tell me, anything is cool  
We haven’t seen it all yet (No)  
Take my hand, let’s go (Come on)  
Once around the planet (Yeah)  
And leave everything else behind  

[Hook: Jamule]  
Everything feels like a dream, not thinking about tomorrow, hey  
Until the sun rises, we’re on our way  
Life wants to let loose, and we want to see it  
I’m sure none of us will sleep today  
Yeah, everything feels like a dream, not thinking about tomorrow, hey  
Until the sun rises, we’re on our way  
Life wants to let loose, and we want to see it  
I’m sure none of us will sleep today
