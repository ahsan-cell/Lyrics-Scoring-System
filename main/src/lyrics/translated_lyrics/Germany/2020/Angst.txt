**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Rymez)

[Hook]  
The fear in your eyes, yeah, I see it  
Every step I take, flawless and neat  
Yeah, I'm always the topic of discussion  
Every day a scandal, but I wear it well

[Part 1]  
Check the GQ, 300 IQ  
I'm like G Unit, not like you  
A beat from Miksu, I don’t need to do much  
Just a few words turn your life into a bitch move  
Without me, YouTubers are back to losing  
Go ahead, get your Valentinos on my back  
Every day a scandal, bring in the millions  
And you ask what I’m doing, that’s a fact, everything’s working  
Screw the BILD newspaper, screw the Blick newspaper  
And the 20 Minuten is looking for some reason  
Just to write something again, putting my picture on the front page  
But it’s all good, as long as your circulation's rising (Ahu)

[Pre-Hook]  
The fear in your eyes, yeah, I see it  
Every step I take, flawless and neat  
Yeah, I'm always the topic of discussion  
Every day a scandal, but I wear it well (That)

[Hook]  
The fear in your eyes, yeah, I see it  
Every step I take, flawless and neat  
Yeah, I'm always the topic of discussion  
Every day a scandal, but I wear it well

[Part 2]  
My face everywhere on the cover  
Is a sign that I’m doing everything right  
If I want, there’s real beef, not a pillow fight  
I’m different from the others, and they know it  
Flashlight, look at the time, half past one  
Everyone’s here because they want my style  
A selfie with you? No way!  
'Cause I know for sure you’ll write about it tomorrow

[Interlude]  
“And to all YouTubers and newspapers: Without me, you wouldn’t have made nearly as much money last year! But no problem, I’ve got the cake, and you can have the crumbs.”

[Part 3]  
You can all keep talking, but it’s not so bad  
Had nothing to do with the rapper in my video  
Had nothing to do with the rapper on my feature  
You make my life yours because you’re a nobody  
They say I only use Hana as a weapon  
And ask a thousand questions about where I am and what I’m doing  
Everything’s the same as always, there’s no one I hate  
Got God on my side, just need Him against all  
And to Mozzik, you’re the father of my daughter  
So let’s ease up on your comments, chill out  
I’d never drag the father of my child through the mud  
Because there’s such a thing as upbringing and respect

[Pre-Hook]  
The fear in your eyes, yeah, I see it  
Every step I take, flawless and neat  
Yeah, I'm always the topic of discussion  
Every day a scandal, but I wear it well

[Hook]  
The fear in your eyes, yeah, I see it  
Every step I take, flawless and neat  
Yeah, I'm always the topic of discussion  
Every day a scandal, but I wear it well
