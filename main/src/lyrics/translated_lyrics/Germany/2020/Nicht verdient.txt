**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Capital Bra]  
Don't tell me that you love me  
Don't tell me you're in love  
Don't tell me that you need me  
'Cause you don't deserve my love  

[Hook: Capital Bra]  
Don't tell me that you love me  
Don't tell me you're in love  
And don't tell me that you need me  
'Cause you don't deserve my love  

[Part 1: Capital Bra]  
She's alone in the hotel, and she's trying  
She’s trying to forget that I exist  
Yeah, she’s trying to forget that she loves me  
She says I stole her heart like a thief  
And I'm flying, taking laps in a Ferrari  
No time for you, the clients want to see me  
And you text me, your high heels are so uncomfortable  
That's why I've left you standing for hours  

[Pre-Hook 1: Capital Bra]  
Your gaze says more than a thousand words  
But every one of those words is a lie  
I know women of your kind  
Don't say that you love, don’t tell me you have feelings  

[Hook: Capital Bra & Loredana]  
Don't tell me that you love me (No, no)  
Don't tell me you're in love (Woah)  
And don't tell me that you need me (Yeah, yeah)  
'Cause you don't deserve my love (Bye-bye)  
Don't tell me that you love me (Uhh)  
Don't tell me you're in love (Woah)  
And don't tell me that you need me (No, no)  
'Cause you don't deserve my love (Bye-bye)  

[Part 2: Loredana]  
Just last night we were out together (Hey)  
And I had your back, no matter how far you went (Pshh)  
But tomorrow you'll realize something's missing (Yeah)  
'Cause eventually, everything becomes too late  
You disappointed me so much, I swear, I mean it seriously  
I was so wrong, I thought you were worth it  
I was so happy, my heart belonged to you  
But my daughter Hana heals all my pain (Hana)  

[Pre-Hook 2: Loredana]  
Yeah, how many times did I fight for you and for me? (Hana)  
Yeah, how many times did you tell me, the world belongs to us? (Hana)  
Yeah, how many times did I lower my head for you?  
For you, that was a weakness, but for me, it was respect  

[Hook: Capital Bra & Loredana]  
Don't tell me that you love me (No, no)  
Don't tell me you're in love (Woah)  
And don't tell me that you need me (Yeah, yeah)  
'Cause you don't deserve my love (Bye-bye)  
Don't tell me that you love me (Uhh)  
Don't tell me you're in love (Woah)  
And don't tell me that you need me (No, no)  
'Cause you don't deserve my love  

[Outro: Capital Bra]  
You don't deserve my love  
'Cause you don't deserve my love  
No, you don't deserve my love  
'Cause you don't deserve my love
