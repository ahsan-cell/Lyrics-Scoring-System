**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(SRNO)

[Hook: Loredana]  
Marijuana  
When I'm with you, you feel better  
I am your marijuana  
You always call me when you're feeling stressed  
Marijuana  
You hold on to me because you like it  
Marijuana  
I am your marijuana  

[Part 1: Loredana]  
Marijuana, Loredana, you see me on every poster  
I've got my driver, cruising at twenty km/h in the city  
What’s all this talk? What’s this karma? Million dollars, boosting sales  
So baby, tell me, are you flying high with me?  
Hold on tight, no, I won’t let you go  
We’re perfect together, no one can catch us  
In the SL, wine red, we push it, I'm psycho  
My Prada suit is snow white  
They want to talk to me, but I don’t see anyone  
No, I don’t need anyone to show me the way  
Show me the way, clear the path  
Get the stuff, roll it in the paper  

[Hook: Loredana & Zuna, Zuna, Loredana]  
Marijuana  
When I'm with you, you feel better  
You are my marijuana  
You always call me when you're feeling stressed  
You are my marijuana  
You hold on to me because you like it  
You are my marijuana  
(You are my marijuana, hey)  

[Part 2: Zuna & Loredana]  
(Zuna) My baby looks good in DIOR  
I’ll get you everything you need, just say a word  
Money doesn’t matter, but Zuna is in shape  
Laughing again because you give everyone the cold shoulder (Brra; haha)  
You’re sharper than a gun, baby (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pam)  
White Widow in my blunt, baby (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pam)  
It’s all so obvious, baby (Pa-pa-pa-pa-pam)  
The way you shoot turns me on, baby  
The way you shoot, the way you shoot, turns me on (Ah-ah)  
Take a hit and I’ll fly across the land (Ah-ah)  
I’ve got enough, bundle after bundle  
That we’re perfect together, there are more than a thousand reasons  

[Hook: Loredana & Zuna, Zuna, Loredana]  
Marijuana  
When I'm with you, you feel better  
You are my marijuana  
You always call me when you're feeling stressed  
You are my marijuana  
You hold on to me because you like it  
You are my marijuana  
(You are my marijuana, hey)
