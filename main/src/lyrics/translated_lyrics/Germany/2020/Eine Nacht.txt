**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)  

[Verse 1]  
I saw you today  
And I thought my heart would stop  
I had goosebumps  
Couldn’t just walk on  
I always sensed it  
That it had to happen someday (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
I pictured it in my mind  
Being alone is now over  

[Chorus]  
I’m saying: One night and one day with you  
Oh, how beautiful would that be? (How beautiful would that be?)  
I embrace the world  
Life is so much fun  
I’m saying: One night and one day alone  
Yes, I swear to you (Swear to you)  
I can’t stand it  
With you, I’m at home  

[Post-Chorus]  
I can’t grasp it, I can’t understand it  
Yesterday I was alone, and today it’s beautiful  
In the end, I’m the king and you’re the queen  
And suddenly I realize, everything makes sense now  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)  

[Verse 2]  
The sky gives its okay  
Often I’ve been hurt (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
When I see your eyes  
I know I can trust you  
I know we fit together  
Like a beautiful melody (Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
Hearts in balance  
It’s never been like this before  

[Chorus]  
I’m saying: One night and one day with you  
Oh, how beautiful would that be? (How beautiful would that be?)  
I embrace the world  
Life is so much fun  
I’m saying: One night and one day alone  
Yes, I swear to you (Swear to you)  
I can’t stand it  
With you, I’m at home  

[Post-Chorus]  
I can’t grasp it, I can’t understand it  
Yesterday I was alone, and today it’s beautiful  
In the end, I’m the king and you’re the queen  
And suddenly I realize, everything makes sense now  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
