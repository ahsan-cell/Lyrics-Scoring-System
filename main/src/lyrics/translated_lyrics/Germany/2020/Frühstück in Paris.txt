**Translated Lyrics:**

Ohh-ohh—, all night long, ey  
Ohh-ohh—, all night long, ey  

**[Hook: Capital Bra]**  
No, no, I’ll never be broke again  
Come on, let’s blow up my Visa  
Baby, baby, tell me what you prefer  
Breakfast in Paris or a party in Ibiza?  
And the cops are looking for me again  
Fake passport and we’re boarding the plane  
Baby, baby, tell me what you prefer  
Breakfast in Paris or a party in Ibiza?  

**[Part 1: CRO]**  
You’ll never have to feel cold again  
It’s December, my baby’s got a tan  
'Cause I have so much cash  
That I could buy this damn sun  
Now it’s mine, but I’ll share it with you  
Let it shine for you, it’s high, just like us  
Flying over seas, a little affair  
Going to the Faroe Islands, can you feel the warmth?  

**[Pre-Hook 1: CRO]**  
Baby, where would you go  
If anything were possible?  

**[Hook: Capital Bra]**  
No, no, I’ll never be broke again  
Come on, let’s blow up my Visa  
Baby, baby, tell me what you prefer  
Breakfast in Paris or a party in Ibiza?  
And the cops are looking for me again  
Fake passport and we’re boarding the plane  
Baby, baby, tell me what you prefer  
Breakfast in Paris or a party in Ibiza?  

**[Part 2: Capital Bra]**  
I just woke up and thought in my dream  
Come on, let’s just escape from this gray city  
Just chilling somewhere, on a yacht (Yeah)  
Like in a fairy tale, like in a thousand and one nights  
Too much cash, but I’ll share it with you  
Baby, just the two of us, come on, let’s heat things up at my place  
Cruising through favelas in a G-Class  
Or Vegas, baby, let’s hit the gas  

**[Pre-Hook 2: Capital Bra]**  
Baby, don’t think this is all fake  
Yeah, I’m printing money like in Money Heist  
Behind us the cops, fleeing in a Ferrari  
Here, your fake passport, First Class all the way to Bali  

**[Hook: Capital Bra]**  
No, no, I’ll never be broke again  
Come on, let’s blow up my Visa  
Baby, baby, tell me what you prefer  
Breakfast in Paris or a party in Ibiza?  
And the cops are looking for me again  
Fake passport and we’re boarding the plane  
Baby, baby, tell me what you prefer  
Breakfast in Paris or a party in Ibiza?  

Ohh-ohh—, all night long, ey  
Ohh-ohh—, all night long, ey  

**[Outro: CRO]**  
Eh-oh-oh-oh  
Eh-oh-oh-oh
