**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook]  
Windows so black, Big Body Benz  
Everything's Paul Shark and the seat heater's on, Murderer  
There's nothing that can hold us back, na-ahh  
Everything sparkles and shines  
Windows so black, Big Body Benz  
Everything's Paul Shark and the seat heater's on, Murderer  
There's nothing that can hold us back, na-ahh  
Everything sparkles and shines  

[Part 1]  
Got a few amplifiers in the trunk  
Bass so heavy, what a cool party! (Ah)  
Playing my tracks, you probably know some  
Pockets full, lots of colorful Smarties (Ah)  
Monkey sees, monkey does  
Get out of my way, if you start a war, blood will flow  
Boredom got me ordering a girl again  
'Cause my dick doesnâ€™t suck itself  

[Hook]  
Windows so black, Big Body Benz  
Everything's Paul Shark and the seat heater's on, Murderer  
There's nothing that can hold us back, na-ahh  
Everything sparkles and shines  
Windows so black, Big Body Benz  
Everything's Paul Shark and the seat heater's on, Murderer  
There's nothing that can hold us back, na-ahh  
Everything sparkles and shines  

[Part 2]  
Breakdance, you can't do anything  
I make a few moves, so cool, you panic  
You break on my jewelry like the Titanic  
From the colorful backpack peeks the automatic  
Breeding a few dogs, even clients from Switzerland  
Show them my parrot and get a hundred thousand likes  
Boredom, counting bills in my bunker, I'm rich  
But unfortunately, this stuff just goes by way too fast  

[Hook]  
Windows so black, Big Body Benz  
Everything's Paul Shark and the seat heater's on, Murderer  
There's nothing that can hold us back, na-ahh  
Everything sparkles and shines  
Windows so black, Big Body Benz  
Everything's Paul Shark and the seat heater's on, Murderer  
There's nothing that can hold us back, na-ahh  
Everything sparkles and shines  

[Outro]  
Every rim shines, Big Body Benz  
Semi-automatic in baggy pants  
Yep, we set signs and we set trends  
And continue to threaten your existence (Mhmm)  
Every rim shines, Big Body Benz  
Semi-automatic in baggy pants  
Yep, we set signs and we set trends  
And continue to threaten your existence  
(Windows so black, black)
