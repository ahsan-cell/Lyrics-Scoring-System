**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: CÉLINE & Ufo361]  
Hey, yeah-yeah, hey, na-na-na  
Hey, yeah-yeah, rich-rich, hey  
Hey, yeah-yeah (You know what's up, yeah)  
Na-na-na (CÉLINE)  
Hey, yeah-yeah (Yeah)  

[Hook: CÉLINE & Ufo361]  
Baby, take a sip  
Dom P. for the emotions  
I’ll raise your dose  
So much jewelry  
More drip than an ocean  
My drinks are frozen  
Take a sip  
Dom P. for the emotions  
I’ll raise your dose  
So much jewelry  
More drip than an ocean  
My drinks are frozen  

[Part 1: CÉLINE & Ufo361]  
Fiji water in my freezer (Yeah, everything's ice)  
You and I on my couch  
I don’t call you because I need you  
But because I have time again (Yeah, yeah)  
I’ll pick you up at five  
Jibbits in the backseat (Let’s go)  
We’re listening to “Swim Good,” Frank Ocean (Hey)  
We drive through 104 at night  
One more hit, we’ll raise our dose  
A hit for the emotions  

[Pre-Hook: CÉLINE & Ufo361, Ufo361]  
And the skyline turns pink (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
High again, for a month (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Yeah, drinking white wine with soda (Yeah)  
But you know I have to leave soon (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Hook: CÉLINE & Ufo361, Ufo361]  
Baby, take a sip  
Dom P. for the emotions (Yeah, yeah)  
I’ll raise your dose  
So much jewelry (So much jewelry)  
More drip than an ocean (Drip)  
My drinks are frozen (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Take a sip (Dom P.)  
Dom P. for the emotions (Yeah, yeah)  
I’ll raise your dose  
So much jewelry (So much jewelry)  
More drip than an ocean (More drip)  
My drinks are frozen  

[Part 2: Ufo361 & CÉLINE]  
Baby, yeah, I’ll buy you diamonds (Diamonds)  
Make you into what you want to be (What you—, what you want to be)  
Take you to the Fiji Islands (Hey, yeah)  
Chanel bag, timeless, hey (Stay High)  
Baby, show me how you dance (How you dance)  
Fast lane, no, she doesn’t want me to brake (Skrrt, skrrt, ha-ah)  
Too much smoke, 'cause the Cali weed burns (Stay High)  
Stay High, Dom P. for the gang (For the—, for the gang)  
Baby, come, let’s fly, private jets  
(We’re drunk, we’re drunk, we’re drunk, hey)  
Eliantte, so much ice around my neck  
(We’re drunk, we’re drunk, we’re drunk, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Hook: CÉLINE & Ufo361, Ufo361 & CÉLINE]  
Baby, take a sip (Ha-ah)  
Dom P. for the emotions (Yeah, yeah)  
I’ll raise your dose  
So much jewelry (So much jewelry)  
More drip than an ocean (You know what's up, yeah, yeah)  
My drinks are frozen  
Take a sip (Take a sip, rich-rich)  
Dom P. for the emotions (Yeah, yeah)  
I’ll raise your dose  
So much jewelry (So much jewelry)  
More drip than an ocean (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
My drinks are frozen (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  

[Outro: Ufo361]  
Stay High, Stay High
