**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Road Runner  
Beep-beep  
Road Runner (Oh)  

[Hook]  
Under power like the Road Runner  
Everyone down on the ground when he fires away  
I put a half slice of cheese on my toast, buddy  
And stack cash like my granddad, uh-oh-oh  
Under power like the Road Runner  
Everyone down on the ground when he fires away  
I put a half slice of cheese on my toast, buddy  
And stack cash like my granddad (Uh-oh-oh)  

[Part 1]  
The police are jealous of my ride (Yeah)  
The girls just scream, we sign on their chests  
I've got a fat stack of bills under my pillow (Yeah)  
And a half automatic gun, no one can rip me off (Oh)  
Hey, they say: "Leave the sluts and the drugs behind" (Haha)  
I bring about fifty girls into the apartment  
Stashing one hundred fifty grams in my pants leg (Okay)  
Overdose on the death certificate (Uh-oh-oh)  

[Hook]  
Under power like the Road Runner  
Everyone down on the ground when he fires away  
I put a half slice of cheese on my toast, buddy  
And stack cash like my granddad, uh-oh-oh  
Under power like the Road Runner  
Everyone down on the ground when he fires away  
I put a half slice of cheese on my toast, buddy  
And stack cash like my granddad  

[Part 2]  
Step out of the car, outfit's fire (Haha)  
Sick smile, don’t need a brace (Fresh)  
Don’t need a house, but I’ll buy one for Mom  
Hey, and smoke marijuana (Bonez)  
A hundred things on my list when I wake up  
And the girl just complains when I go out (Girl)  
A fat chain, your ghetto is my runway  
Couldn’t look any better (Uh-oh-oh)  

[Hook]  
Under power like the Road Runner  
Everyone down on the ground when he fires away  
I put a half slice of cheese on my toast, buddy  
And stack cash like my granddad, uh-oh-oh  
Under power like the Road Runner  
Everyone down on the ground when he fires away  
I put a half slice of cheese on my toast, buddy  
And stack cash like my granddad (Uh-oh-oh)  

[Bridge]  
If it doesn’t bring cash, it makes no sense to me (Muahaha)  
Every day hunting for the dollar  
In the end, there’s an AK to the face  
You ride your bike, I’m speeding on my scooter (Oh, yeah)  
And each of you knows, quality has its price  
So why argue? Because you’re gonna buy anyway  
Everything’s so easy today, every day Thug Life  
I want the new S-Coupe, not a house by the lake  

[Outro]  
Road Runner  
Beep-beep  
Road Runner (Oh)  
Beep-beep (Yeah)  
Beep-beep
