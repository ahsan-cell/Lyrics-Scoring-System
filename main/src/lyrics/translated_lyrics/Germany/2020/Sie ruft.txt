**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Lucry  
Sounds  
*Cough*

[Part 1]  
His street is empty when the sun leaves it behind  
He quietly closes his door, so he won't wake her up  
Out every night, even if it hurts her  
No rules, no spark, hope, no law  
What can I do about it? Reported again  
The police are at the door, they drop the case  
I seduced you back then, Apache touched you  
And today you wear haute couture  
And head home (And head home)

[Pre-Hook]  
You don’t need to cry  
No, the blood on my shirt isn’t mine  
Sleep peacefully, I’ll stay home tonight  
I’m lying to you, but you know the deal, baby, I’m sorry

[Hook]  
The street, it calls  
Yes, it calls  
The street, it calls  
Yes, it calls (Yes, it calls, yes, it calls, yes, it calls)

[Part 2]  
His street is full when the sun comes back (-comes)  
But he sits at home and drinks whisky on the rocks (rocks)  
He gathers some strength and walks around the block  
With a black sports bag and a silver button  
Two rings on each hand, T-shirt tucked in  
Yeah, I’m poisoning the land, tell me what’s healthy here?  
No, I won’t be driven, pink ski mask, in the bank  
Everything’s chill, everything without pressure

[Pre-Hook]  
You don’t need to cry  
No, the blood on my shirt isn’t mine  
Sleep peacefully, I’ll stay home tonight  
I’m lying to you, but you know the deal, baby, I’m sorry

[Hook]  
The street, it calls  
Yes, it calls  
The street, it calls  
Yes, it calls (Yes, it calls, yes, it calls, yes, it calls)
