**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1]  
Whatever comes, babe, I’ll stay here  
No matter what, I’ll prove it to you  
Your love is enough for me  
Remember back then  
You said you wanted nothing more  
Except for me, it’s been a while  
You’re gone, it wasn’t worth anything to you  

[Pre-Hook 1]  
The paddles were so small here  
No motor, babe, forgive me  
Now I’m sitting here alone  
Ah-ah  
Everything around us is fragile  
Believe me, I’ll never forget  
Now I’m sitting here alone  
Ah-ah  

[Hook]  
I’m coming to get you today, we’ll sail on my boat  
And this time out into the open sea  
Back then it was a no, my sail was too small for you  
But that old boat is no more  
Babe, I’m coming to get you today, we’ll sail on my boat  
And this time out into the open sea  
Back then it was a no, my sail was too small for you  
But that old boat is no more (No more)  

[Part 2]  
If you’re not with me, babe, tell me, what do you have planned?  
Hey, it feels like such a long time  
I asked, no answer  
Remember back then  
You wanted to be everywhere, but not here  
You had plans, just not with me  
So much ahead, babe, forgive me  

[Pre-Hook 2]  
Because the paddles were so small here  
There was room for two here  
Now I’m sitting here alone  
Ah-ah  
The sea was too stormy for you  
This song is for you  
Now I’m sitting here alone  
Ah-ah  

[Hook]  
I’m coming to get you today, we’ll sail on my boat  
And this time out into the open sea  
Back then it was a no, my sail was too small for you  
But that old boat is no more  
Babe, I’m coming to get you today, we’ll sail on my boat  
And this time out into the open sea  
Back then it was a no, my sail was too small for you  
But that old boat is no more (No more)
