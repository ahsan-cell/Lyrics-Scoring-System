**Translated Lyrics:**

[Hook: AK Ausserkontrolle & Bonez MC, Both]  
In my Benz, I roll like a ghetto president  
In my Benz, I hand out free T-shirts to the fans  
In my Benz, you see my king's chain  
How it shines, in my Benz  
In my Benz, I take a few laps with the gang  
In my Benz, I give autographs to the fans (Always)  
In my Benz, you see my Rolex  
How it shines (Haha), in my Benz (Wouh)  

[Part 1: Bonez MC]  
In my Benz, I count the stacks and drink Capri Sun  
I’ve reserved two tables, even if I don’t come to the party (Crazy)  
And my girl texts: “Why don’t you have time?” (Ahh)  
I buy her a pair of shark Nikes, just to keep her quiet (Shut up)  
I’m sorry, my life revolves around cannabis  
And for stress, I’ve got some banana clips like a Salafist (Shit), heh  
And while you live like a bum  
You see me in the AMG on three-piece MAEs  
Uff, ya salame, the street loves me (Uff)  
I run red lights just on principle, till death I’ll stay a bandit (Yeah, yeah)  
The code is 187, brother, Sonus makes the beat (Sonus)  
I sell you Dogo Argentino, but Bonez has crocodile (Wouh, shit)

In my Benz, I hand out free T-shirts to the fans  
In my Benz, you see my king's chain  
How it shines, in my Benz  
In my Benz, I take a few laps with the gang  
In my Benz, I give autographs to the fans (Always)  
In my Benz, you see my Rolex  
How it shines (Haha), in my Benz  

[Part 2: AK Ausserkontrolle]  
Yesterday I was in a cell, today with groupies at the Sheraton  
You see me sitting in the Benz, just like Lewis Hamilton  
LV and Fendi shirt, while I count the cash  
You’re wearing second-hand like people with an arm prosthesis  
Gangster and no profiler  
Kahis shaking in my classic ride  
And the Benz turns into a lowrider  
Boss in existence, even when the sun doesn’t shine anymore  
I’m not talking about rice, but the uncle stands in front of the Benz  
Joyride, speeding in the AMG E-Coupe  
I cruise, means I’m driving with Penelope  
With your girl towards Hollywood Hills  
Because she dances out of line like in a Bollywood film
