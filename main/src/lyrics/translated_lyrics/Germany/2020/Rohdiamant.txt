**Translated Lyrics:**

[Part 1]  
I’m a goddamn rough diamond like Pacino in the '70s  
That’s why I’m making waves, you see  
Wallah, I numb myself with Hennessy  
And still hit your head when I shoot at your Caddy  
Just like Lee Harvey did to the Kennedys  
Akhi, I roll up like a thug to the party in my Adidas NMDs  
You lack the energy for this game  
Dude, you don’t live in the ghetto, look, we pray for better days  
Green, yellow, purple cash, just like Gatorade  
Stacking in the VIP, Kabul ya salame  
I’ll swing by soon in my matte black AMG  
And then just steal the safe from KaDeWe  
Yeah, I’ve been flipping things since I was thirteen  
Wasn’t an only child, had to bring in some green  
And that’s why I’m killing rap, soon I’ll be big in the game  
And suddenly bitches are stripping in my bed

[Hook]  
'Cause I’m a goddamn rough diamond, uncut  
My voice hits hard like Doberman bites  
Threatening like lung collapses  
It gets real when they diss Ersguterjunge  
'Cause I’m a rough diamond  
And still, you’ll find me at night in strange apartments  
I’m a rough diamond, my verses are sick  
Look, and soon I’ll have millions in the bank  

[Part 2]  
I’m a goddamn rough diamond like De Niro in the '70s  
That’s why I’m making waves, you see  
Look, I do it all for the family  
Robbing tourists today at the East Side Gallery  
Whoa, 'cause I’m real, ya salame  
Pulling knives like a butcher’s academy  
I step out, all black like a gospel choir  
They’re shadowing me, what do these bitches want?  
She says, “Why are you robbing kicks?”  
She says, “Purple was a massive hit!”  
But that’s not the point, watch how I’m living life  
'Cause there’s no antidote for my poison, please go  
Your killers can’t catch me  
'Cause I blow them away, rrah, flyweight  
You wanna test me, then come  
But it’s already set in stone, I’ll tear you apart  

[Hook]  
'Cause I’m a goddamn rough diamond, uncut  
My voice hits hard like Doberman bites  
Threatening like lung collapses  
It gets real when they diss Ersguterjunge  
'Cause I’m a rough diamond  
And still, you’ll find me at night in strange apartments  
I’m a rough diamond, my verses are sick  
Look, and soon I’ll have millions in the bank  
I’m a goddamn rough diamond
