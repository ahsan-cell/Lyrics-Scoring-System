**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In my life  
I've often flown  
I've fallen deep  
And sometimes I've drowned  
I've won  
And I've lost  
And I've died  
And been reborn  
I've given  
And I've taken  
And we found each other  
And we've come so far  
I'm close to myself  
Yet always feeling strange  
It feels a bit like being alone  
And that no one knows my name  
I don't want to be poor  
And money doesn't make me rich  
Sometimes life is hard  
And most times I find it easy  
I've cried  
And I've laughed  
And finally figured out  
What makes me beautiful  
I've drunk  
And I've smoked  
And I've completely exhausted  
All my strength  
And when I get back  
On my feet again  
It's always life anew  
It's always sunshine again  

[Chorus]  
And here you are  
Holding my hand and laughing  
Because you know me better than I do  
I'm in love with you  
I can't imagine my life  
Without you in it  

[Verse 2]  
In my life  
I've often flown  
I've also lied  
And betrayed both you and me  
I've lived  
And was intoxicated by it  
I flew up to the sky  
And sank down deep  
I let myself hang  
And then I stand up again  
I live so healthily  
And I take drugs too  
I count the years  
And sometimes I don’t  
I stand in the dark  
And I like the light  

[Chorus]  
And here you are  
Holding my hand and laughing  
Because you know me better than I do  
I'm in love with you  
I can't imagine my life  
Without you in it  

[Verse 3]  
I love some people  
And some love me  
And those who don’t love me  
I don’t miss at all  
I love my children  
And I love you  
And sometimes I feel nothing  
Then I don’t even feel myself  
I wish for peace  
And serenity  
A heart that’s always warm  
I’m not quite there yet  
And freedom does me good  
Sometimes I hurt myself  
I feel strong  
Even when I’m not  
Standing straight  
My fear of dying  
Turns into air  
Slowly dissolving  
Because life is calling me  

[Chorus]  
And here you are  
Holding my hand and laughing  
Because you know me better than I do  
I'm in love with you  
I can't imagine my life  
Without you in it  

[Outro]  
With you, I want to go on and I’ll follow you  
And you always take from me too  
I’m in love with this life  
And I’ll stay here just a little longer  
With you
