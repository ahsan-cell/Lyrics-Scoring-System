**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1 - Maître Gims]**  
I chose to leave and isolate myself  
Mom, how can I say it, I'm sorry  
The counselor clearly overlooked me  
And like a fool, I just said okay  
And every day I think about quitting  
People want to make me an entity  
I’m going to drop everything  
I’m just a man, I’ll end up breaking down  

**[Chorus - Maître Gims]**  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  

**[Verse 2 - Barack Adama]**  
Me too, brothers, I’m going to leave  
Join all my people, the crazy ones  
Paris is Alcatraz  
Tired of fines and all this paperwork  
Their hearts are dark and thin like a Senegalese  
Listening to them, you’d think bleeding was necessary  
I want my wife, my faith, my kids  
For that, believe me, I’ll use all my strength  

**[Chorus - Maître Gims]**  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  

**[Verse 3 - Lefa]**  
Forgive me, grandmother, please  
I would have come to see you if I had more money  
But you know it’s not easy here either  
In France, hardship hits us hard too  
Sorry to the math, English, and French teachers  
Don’t worry, my father really laid into me  
Sorry, Mr. Banker  
But if I take off, you won’t miss me  

**[Chorus - Maître Gims]**  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  

**[Verse 4 - Black M]**  
Mom, Dad, I tell you: "We’re struggling"  
I know in your minds you’re already there  
I may say I have it, but I don’t have the faith  
I messed up, I started at the end  
I shouldn’t have gotten into music when I was young  
I should have listened to you, Dad, when I was little  
I feel guilty  
When I see what this country of infidels has done to you  

**[Chorus - Maître Gims]**  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  
And I had to walk the streets  
Step by step, I tell myself it’s not true  
Dad, Mom, guys: I’m sorry  
I feel like I want to isolate myself  

**[Outro - Maître Gims]**  
I chose to leave and isolate myself  
Mom, how can I say it, I'm sorry  
The counselor clearly overlooked me  
And like a fool, I just said okay
