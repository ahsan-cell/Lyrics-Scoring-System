**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kay One]  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  

[Part 1: Bushido]  
Hey, Germany brings out the flags  
They hang from balconies, on garden houses  
On a thousand windows, car windows  
On the hood of the Benz, man  
On the steering wheel, black-red-gold  
And yes, we Germans are so proud right now  
Across the country, everyone is watching  
Fight, even when the opponents boo  
You can do it, just go for it  
My song, the sun's substitute bench flow  
We’re cheering along, live you’ll see, 2010 (2010)  
Not just a football trend, I was a fan as a kid (fan)  
And I believe I speak for the whole country  
When I say: Go out and win this fight!  

[Hook: Kay One]  
We’re taking the trophy home for the fourth time  
South Africa, we’re coming and nothing comes for free  
And Germany fights, and the country cheers along  
The team stands like torches in the wind  

[Part 2: Kay One]  
Yo, Germany claims the victory, the World Cup  
It already belongs to us, the torch is burning  
Show, show what you’ve got  
Because that’s how it can escalate in the final  
Whether kids, fans, parents, grandpas  
Everyone sits with a six-pack on the sofa  
We turn on the TV  
And suddenly the spotlight comes on  
I say: Thank God for football, because  
All of Germany is now a football fan  
South Africa, we’re coming  
And I pray that we get the trophy  
You see the German flag everywhere  
Players on every billboard  
Eighty-two million people  
Watch as their heroes fight  

[Hook: Kay One]  
We’re taking the trophy home for the fourth time  
South Africa, we’re coming and nothing comes for free  
And Germany fights, and the country cheers along  
The team stands like torches in the wind  

[Bridge: Kay One]  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  
Olé-olé-olé, olé-olé-olé  

[Hook: Kay One]  
We’re taking the trophy home for the fourth time  
South Africa, we’re coming and nothing comes for free  
And Germany fights, and the country cheers along  
The team stands like torches in the wind  
We’re taking the trophy home for the fourth time  
South Africa, we’re coming and nothing comes for free  
And Germany fights, and the country cheers along  
The team stands like torches in the wind
