**Translated Lyrics:**

He’s alone in his room  
Standing in front of the mirror, singing his songs  
She’s been writing for years  
To the companies in her town, but nothing ever came back  
He’s always wanted  
To travel the whole world, saving everything he has  
She plays a thousand little roles  
And wants to go to Hollywood, she’s so tired of it all here  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Leave your old life behind  
And walk through this new door  

**[Chorus]**  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because they are the winners  
We know no limits  
From today on, forever  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because everything would be meaningless  
Without dreamers like you and me  

**[Verse 2]**  
He’s actually Elvis Presley  
Just reborn, people will see  
She’s been carrying plates for years  
And saving every cent for her own café  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Leave your old life behind  
And walk through this new door  

**[Chorus]**  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because they are the winners  
We know no limits  
From today on, forever  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because everything would be meaningless  
Without dreamers like you and me  

**[Bridge]**  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
We are the winners  
We know no limits  
From today on, forever  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because everything would be meaningless  
Without dreamers like you and me  

**[Chorus]**  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because they are the winners  
We know no limits  
From today on, forever  
This goes out to all the dreamers  
Because everything would be meaningless  
Without dreamers like you and me  

**[Outro]**  
Dreamers like you and me
