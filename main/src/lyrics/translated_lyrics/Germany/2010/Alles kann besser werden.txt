**Translated Lyrics:**

Everything can get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
Everything should get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
And everything will get better  
We’ll bring heaven to Earth  
And no one has to risk their life anymore  
One of the most precious treasures on Earth  

[Verse: Xaiver Naidoo]  
I want to get out of this mess here  
But I don’t know how that’s supposed to happen  
Out of this damn area  
But I don’t know how that’s supposed to happen  
They lock me in this district  
Because they don’t want me to see the rest of the world  
I will walk out of this prison  
When I know where I’m supposed to go  

[Chorus: Xaiver Naidoo]  
Everything can get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
Everything should get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
And everything will get better  
We’ll bring heaven to Earth  
And no one has to risk their life anymore  
One of the most precious treasures on Earth  

[Verse 2: Xaiver Naidoo]  
Even if you’re crying bitterly now  
Please don’t give up  
Even if you’re denying life right now  
Please don’t give up  
Even if you seem to be lost  
Please don’t give up  
Even if everything seems ruined  
Don’t give up  

[Chorus: Xaiver Naidoo]  
Everything can get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
Everything should get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
And everything will get better  
We’ll bring heaven to Earth  
And no one has to risk their life anymore  
One of the most precious treasures on Earth  

[Verse 3: Janet Grogan]  
I can see beyond the borders of here  
And I know there’s more for me  
I’m not afraid to face what they fear  
If it means I can be free  
Discourage me if you think you can  
But I won’t stop till I’m out of here  
Yeah, I just don’t give a damn  
Not afraid to face what they fear  

[Chorus: Xaiver Naidoo]  
Everything can get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
Everything should get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
And everything will get better  
We’ll bring heaven to Earth  
And no one has to risk their life anymore  
One of the most precious treasures on Earth  
Everything can get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
Everything should get better  
Let’s bring heaven to Earth  
And everything will get better  
We’ll bring heaven to Earth  
And no one has to risk their life anymore  
One of the most precious treasures on Earth  

[Outro: Xaiver Naidoo]  
Please don’t give up  
Please don’t give up  
Please don’t give up  
Don’t give up
