**Translated Lyrics:**

In a dream of ice and light  
Snow lies on trees and valleys  
Flakes caress my face  
My heart longs for home  
For safety, shelter, and peace  
Life draws closer together  
Dreams reflect in the winterland  

When the sky snows white stars  
Wishes come true once more  
The world lies in silver snow  
Time begins to dream  

The trees stand in deep silence  
The wind lifts the branches high  
Children laugh  
On lakes and streams  
Frost blows snowflowers to the windows  
Strangers share a smile  
People reach out their hands  
The world comes a little closer  
Dreams reflect in the winterland  

When the sky snows white stars  
Wishes come true once more  
The world lies in silver snow  
Time begins to dream  

Sparkling lights in the windows  
And a fire warms him at night  
I often think of those who are missing  
And gaze out into the winterland  

When the sky snows white stars  
Wishes come true once more  
The world lies in silver snow  
Time begins to dream  

When the sky snows white stars  
Wishes come true once more  
The world lies in silver snow  
Time begins to dream
