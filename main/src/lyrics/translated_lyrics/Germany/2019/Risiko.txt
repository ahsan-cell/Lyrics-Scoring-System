**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: RAF Camora]  
Ahh  
Ahh, ahh  

[Part 1: RAF Camora]  
Brother, what does the world cost?  
Currently nothing, but it costs something every day  
I’m buying myself a Mercedes-Benz  
Seven points, no idea how long I can still drive  
We are professionals  
We only shoot after one PM, so that works  
Chay is more than perfect  
But she might be a Kahba*  
I smoke ten cigarettes a day (Ah-ah)  
On the pack, there’s a picture, I tear it off  
Buying a huge apartment (Ah-ah)  
Supposedly I’m a star, who knows if it lasts  
Pow-pow-pow from the S-Coupé  
But when the police came, it was too late  
Again and again bam-bam, we’re on tour  
Ten thousand people singing “Olé Olé”  

[Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]  
I go to the limit every day  
Could be that I’m dead tomorrow  
Grateful that we’re still here  
Yeah, brother, I know the risk  
Could be that I’m hanging at the beach  
Or completely high at Tipico*  
What must be done, must be done  

[Post-Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC, Bonez MC]  
No risk stops me (No risk stops me, no)  
No risk stops me (No risk stops me, no)  
No, no risk stops me (No risk stops me, no)  
No risk stops me (Oh, oh-oh)  

[Part 2: Bonez MC]  
So many weapons in music videos  
Sometimes they bring problems with them  
Man, we value authenticity  
One hundred percent, otherwise it doesn’t work  
Who likes to have sex with a condom?  
No, I never buckle up in the car  
If he wants, then he should come get me  
But as long as women keep jumping on my dick  
So much codeine  
Hasn’t killed me yet  
But if I stay in bed tomorrow morning  
Then I’ve made the best of it  
Between Hamburg and Berlin  
I write my lyrics on the page  
And because of that, this junkie makes millions  
Mama, who would have thought?  

[Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]  
I go to the limit every day  
Could be that I’m dead tomorrow  
Grateful that we’re still here  
Yeah, brother, I know the risk  
Could be that I’m hanging at the beach  
Or completely high at Tipico  
What must be done, must be done  

[Bridge: RAF Camora & Bonez MC, RAF Camora, Bonez MC]  
No risk stops me (Ah-ah)  
No risk stops me (Ah-ah)  
No, no risk stops me (Ah-ah)  
No risk stops me (Oh, ah-ah)  

[Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC]  
I go to the limit every day  
Could be that I’m dead tomorrow  
Grateful that we’re still here  
Yeah, brother, I know the risk  
Could be that I’m hanging at the beach  
Or completely high at Tipico  
What must be done, must be done  

[Post-Hook: RAF Camora & Bonez MC, Bonez MC]  
No risk stops me (No risk stops me, no)  
No risk stops me (No risk stops me, no)  
No, no risk stops me (No risk stops me, no)  
No risk stops me (Oh, oh-oh)
