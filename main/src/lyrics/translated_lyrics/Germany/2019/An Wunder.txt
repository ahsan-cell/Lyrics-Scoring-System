**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  

[Verse 1]  
My world feels just too small right now  
And yours doesn’t seem to fit somehow  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We thought we’d be forever, didn’t we?  
When did we start to stop being “we”?  
And aren’t we no better off alone?  
A thousand reasons to leave, but one is enough to stay home  
Why can’t you see that we are all we need?  

[Chorus]  
Hey, it would be foolish not to believe in miracles (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
And it’s too beautiful not to take the risk (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
And even if there’s so much against us  
We actually know how to make it better  
Hey, then it would be foolish not to believe in miracles  
Hey, not to believe in miracles  

[Verse 2]  
All you need right now is time  
You’ve been saying that for quite a while  

[Pre-Chorus]  
We thought we’d be forever, didn’t we?  
When did we start to stop being “we”?  
I hold on to your little “maybe”  

[Chorus]  
Hey, it would be foolish not to believe in miracles (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
And it’s too beautiful not to take the risk (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
And even if there’s so much against us  
We actually know how to make it better  
Hey, then it would be foolish not to believe in miracles (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
Hey, not to believe in miracles  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  

[Bridge]  
A thousand reasons to leave, but one is enough to stay home  
Hey, why can’t you see that we are all we need?  

[Chorus]  
Hey, it would be foolish not to believe in miracles (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
And it’s too beautiful not to take the risk (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
And even if there’s so much against us  
We actually know how to make it better  
Hey, then it would be foolish not to believe in miracles (Uh-uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)  
Hey, not to believe in miracles  

[Post-Chorus]  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Hey, not to believe in miracles  
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh  
Hey, not to believe in miracles
