**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Bra, bra, bra (Woof, Bra)  
Yeah, Bra (Woof, woof, woof, woof, Kuku, Kuku)  
Berlin lives (Woof, bra, woof, bra)  
Berlin lives, Berlin lives, yeah (Jajaja)  
(Yeah, bra) Everyone step aside (Hahahaha, hahahaha)  
You know what's up, Bra  
You can't handle me, brother  
Ah, brraa  

[Part 1]  
Forget the rappers, what they say is all lies  
Abiat, Massari, Abiad, I’m packing heavy bags (Bra)  
Berlin lives, Ghetto, Ghetto, Bra, we come in packs  
What fitness plan, mate? In my area, bullets fly (Bra, bra)  
Now the money rolls in, now you can Google the bro (Yeah)  
Today I’m eating steak, yesterday it was five-minute noodles (Bra, bra)  
I’m the original, the rest are doubles  
Life is a bitch, I grab the whore by the throat  
No scruples (No), the bro is a lion (Yeah)  
Look how I kill my enemies with just words (Look)  
The state doesn’t want to see me on top like minimum wages (Yeah)  
But their kids look like my sons  

[Hook]  
I hit the AMG 300 and the earth shakes (Braa)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  
Everything changes, but never the quality of Capis (Quality)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  
Ghetto, Ghetto, because in my world only money counts (Yeah, bra)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  
No German passport, mate, the application got denied (Hahaha)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  

[Part 2]  
Forget all the haters, I’m spreading good Beyda (Yeah)  
To customers from Bavaria with a balance like Neymar (Yeah)  
Bro, what protection money? I handle my own business (Yeah)  
And come to the table with sharp ones, just like Thai waiters  
My teachers used to ask, “What will you become later?”  
And today I’m pushing cars with six hundred eighty horses (Yeah)  
Call Ufo quickly and sort out jewels from Antwerp (Ufo)  
Bra, I only want money, I have no patience for whores  
And all the people notice (Yeah), the bro has a problem  
I come with Egzon to your shop, pack the bars in the sheets (Bra, bra, bra)  
No choice, mate, yeah, my stomach’s growling  
Bro, what gangsters? My bros are psychopaths  

[Hook]  
I hit the AMG 300 and the earth shakes (Bra)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  
Everything changes, but never the quality of Capis (Quality)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  
Ghetto, Ghetto, because in my world only money counts (Yeah, bra)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  
No German passport, mate, the application got denied (Hahaha)  
I step on stage and shout “Berlin lives!”  

[Outro]  
Berlin lives  
Berlin lives
