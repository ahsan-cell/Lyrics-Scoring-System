**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
(Uh) Healing the confusion of my heart  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
But there's no one who can take your place  

[Verse 1]  
Am I high or low? Am I bipolar?  
Need another "you" to shake it off, shake it off  
Oh, I love this face, perfect stranger  
'Cause I could use someone to shake it off, shake it off  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But I know I can't get you out of my head  
And I know I can't numb you away  
Yeah, I know if I wake up with her instead  
No, there's no one who can take your place  
No, there's no one who can take your place  

[Chorus]  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
(Uh) Healing the confusion of my heart  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
But there's no one who can take your place  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
(Uh) Lost all my illusions  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
'Cause there's no one who can take your place  

[Verse 2]  
Gotta loosen my emotions  
Just started to shake it off, shake it off  
When I hear your name, I can't stay sober  
I could use someone to shake it off, shake it off  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But I know I can't get you out of my head (Oh no)  
And I know I can't numb you away  
Yeah, I know if I wake up with her instead  
No, there's no one who can take your place  
No, there's no one, no  
No, there's no one, no  
No, there's no one, no  
No, there's no one who can take your place  

[Chorus]  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
(Uh) Healing the confusion of my heart  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
But there's no one who can take your place  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
(Uh) Lost all my illusions  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
'Cause there's no one who can take your place  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
(Uh) Lost all my illusions  
(Uh) I've been searching for a replacement  
'Cause there's no one who can take your place
