**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Udo Lindenberg]  
Da-da-da  
Da-dei, da-da  

[Verse 1: Udo Lindenberg]  
I hear the seagulls singing by the harbor  
The last song before we’re kicked out  
I haven’t counted the years for a long time  
That I’ve sat in this thick smoke  
There used to be another bar here  
But the liquor still tastes the same  
And if I ever felt at home  
It was always where the applause roars  

[Pre-Chorus: Apache 207]  
And when I go  
I’ll leave just like I came, like a comet  
That strikes twice  
Maybe it’ll hurt  
But I want to be sure that I live forever  
Let’s turn it up one more time  

[Chorus: Apache 207 & Udo Lindenberg]  
And when I go  
I’ll leave just like I came, like a comet  
That strikes twice  
Maybe it’ll hurt  
But I want to be sure that I live forever  
Let’s turn it up one more time  
Let’s turn it up one more time  

[Verse 2: Apache 207, Udo Lindenberg & Both]  
I’m taking this glass from the club with me  
Confetti lies on the streets  
I proudly carry the flag  
Downing the very last sip  
“Where are the last days?”  
I ask the taxi driver  
And he asks me what I want  
I don’t want to fall asleep  
I want a footprint of mine, stronger than time  
And I tell you, no other foot fits in there  
So please don’t drop me off alone at home  
They should see  

[Pre-Chorus: Udo Lindenberg]  
Yes, when I go  
I’ll leave just like I came, like a comet  
That strikes twice  
Maybe it’ll hurt  
But I want to be sure that I live forever  
Let’s turn it up one more time  

[Chorus: Apache 207, Udo Lindenberg & Both]  
And when I go  
I’ll leave just like I came, like a comet  
That strikes twice  
Maybe it’ll hurt  
But I want to be sure that I live forever  
Let’s turn it up one more time  

[Outro: Udo Lindenberg & Apache 207]  
Let’s turn it up one more time  
Let’s turn it up one more time (Let’s turn it up one more time)  
Da-da, da-da  
Let’s turn it up one more time (Let’s turn it up one more time, yeah)
