**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
JUMPA, make it jump!

[Part 1]  
I look like the nineties, she’s got daddy issues  
My Buffalos so high, you won't step on my shoes  
I dance better than her ex, I've got rhythm in my blood  
And makeup stains from last night on my pillowcase  

[Pre-Hook]  
I say: “Ohh,” how does the fourth mix taste?  
I’m not that smart, but my hair’s slicked in place  
You son of a bitch, what good is all your wealth  
When Apache opens the third button of his shirt?  

[Hook]  
You have to get up early, he’s coming too late  
She’s already said for the third time: “Let’s go, wait”  
But the night doesn’t stop, no, the night doesn’t stop  
As long as the disco ball spins  
You have to get up early, he’s coming too late  
She’s already said for the third time: “Let’s go, wait”  
But the night doesn’t stop, no, the night doesn’t stop  
As long as the disco ball spins, hey  

[Part 2]  
A little of this, a little of that, maybe a bit too much  
All the streets are cleared, but there’s traffic as such  
Your guy comes from a good home, what a background  
But he’s got short hair and I’ve got a ponytail (Apache)  

[Pre-Hook]  
Ohh, how does the eighth mix taste?  
That the night is long gone, I sadly didn’t catch  
You son of a bitch, what good is all your wealth  
When Apache elegantly steps onto the dance floor in his shirt?  

[Hook]  
You have to get up early, he’s coming too late  
She’s already said for the third time: “Let’s go, wait”  
But the night doesn’t stop, no, the night doesn’t stop  
As long as the disco ball spins  
You have to get up early, he’s coming too late  
She’s already said for the third time: “Let’s go, wait”  
But the night doesn’t stop, no, the night doesn’t stop  
As long as the disco ball spins
