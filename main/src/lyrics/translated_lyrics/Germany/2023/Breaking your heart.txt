**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(JUMPA, make it jump!)

[Part 1]  
You hear me driving past your house (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)  
And you dare to look out the window now (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)  
What a mistake, baby, do you know what you're doing? (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)  
Yeah, you want it, but I'm not what you need (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)

[Pre-Hook]  
Uhh, you've resisted so many times before, yeah (Resisted, yeah)  
This has never impressed you, uh-uhh  
But you've never seen so many horses pulling, yeah  
Right in front of your nose, way too sexy

[Hook]  
Baby, I know you want to be with me  
But please, please don’t get in  
What you don’t know  
At the end of the road, I'll be breaking your heart  
Oh baby, I don’t want to be alone  
But please, please don’t get in  
'Cause what you don’t know  
At the end of the road, I'll be breaking your heart

[Part 2]  
I know your parents are already asleep (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)  
But I don’t care, I’m not their son-in-law (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)  
And as luck would have it, the light turns red  
Right in front of your balcony (Eh-eh)  
If you come now, it’s no longer my fault (Ah-ah-ah, ah, ah-ah)

[Pre-Hook]  
Uhh, you've resisted so many times before, yeah (Resisted, yeah)  
This has never impressed you, uh-uhh  
But you've never seen so many horses pulling, yeah  
Right in front of your nose, way too sexy

[Hook]  
Baby, I know you want to be with me  
But please, please don’t get in  
What you don’t know  
At the end of the road, I'll be breaking your heart  
Oh baby, I don’t want to be alone  
But please, please don’t get in  
'Cause what you don’t know  
At the end of the road, I'll be breaking your heart
