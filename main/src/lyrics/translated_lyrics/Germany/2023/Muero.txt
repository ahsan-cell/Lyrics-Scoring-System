**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  

[Verse 1]  
Who are you and what’s your name?  
I’ve never seen you around here, yeah, yeah  
Do you think I could invite you  
To a simple dance? Say yes, yeah, yeah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
There’s something in your eyes  
That has me hypnotized  
Oh-oh, oh  

[Chorus]  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
I’ve been wondering for a while  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
With just a glance, I’ll come closer to you  
I want you so much, so much, so much, that  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  

[Verse 2]  
With you in my life, I wouldn’t need  
A single ray of sunshine, you’re a ray of sunshine, eh  
Because people always tell me  
That you are meant for me, that you are meant for me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
There’s something in your eyes  
That has me hypnotized  
Oh-oh, oh  

[Chorus]  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
I’ve been wondering for a while  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
With just a glance, I’ll come closer to you  
I want you so much, so much, so much, that  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  

[Bridge]  
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
I’ve been wondering for a while  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh (Oh)  

[Chorus]  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
I’ve been wondering for a while  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh  
With just a glance, I’ll come closer to you  
I want you so much, so much, so much, that  
I’m dying to have you here by my side  
Who, who are you?  
Oh-oh, oh
