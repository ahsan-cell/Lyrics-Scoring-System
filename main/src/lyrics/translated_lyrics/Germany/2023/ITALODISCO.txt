**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Missing a penalty kick  
Playing before Coldplay  
Maybe yes, maybe no  
At least you’re always right (Excuse me?)  
How many questions would I ask you?  
Tell me yes, tell me no  
I have a tattoo to redo  
Because I don’t like it anymore  
Sometimes anxiety rises in me (Rises in me)  
What really gets me angry  
Is when you stop talking to me  
And the world seems all the same (All the same)  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
I trust you more than I trust myself  
More than my friends, more than the DJs  

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Hurry, I can’t resist  
Italo disco, sorry for insisting  
But tonight  
What I prefer  
Is a fixed idea  
An unexpected moment to make love (Ah)  

[Chorus]  
This isn’t Ibiza  
Festivalbar with the steady beat  
I’m looking for you, but it’s thick fog  
I swear, when I think of you, my head plays  
Plays Italo disco  

[Verse 2]  
I’m distracted and you’re serious  
Each lost in our own thoughts  
Maybe yes, maybe no  
The bass of Righeira kicks in  
If I look into your eyes-oi-oi-oi  
What really gets me angry  
Is when you don’t reply anymore  
And sometimes anxiety rises in me (Rises in me)  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
I trust you more than I trust myself  
More than my friends, more than the DJs  

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Hurry, I can’t resist  
Italo disco, sorry for insisting  
But tonight  
What I prefer  
Is a fixed idea  
An unexpected moment to make love (Ah)  

[Chorus]  
This isn’t Ibiza  
Festivalbar with the steady beat  
I’m looking for you, but it’s thick fog  
I swear, when I think of you, my head plays  
Plays Italo disco  

[Bridge]  
(Disco, plays Italo disco)  
(Disco, plays Italo –)  
I wish I could explain how much I miss you  
Moroder in my soul  
The beat kicks in, yet I stay silent, Italo disco (Ahah)  

[Chorus]  
This isn’t Ibiza  
Festivalbar with the steady beat  
I’m looking for you, but it’s thick fog  
I swear, when I think of you, my head plays  
Plays Italo disco  
Plays Italo disco  
I swear, when I think of you, my head plays  
Plays Italo disco
