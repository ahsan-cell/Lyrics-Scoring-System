**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Paul]  
I'm on my way, no time to lose  
Picaldi jeans in light blue from 2004  
Yeah, a lot has changed, yet we stay right here  
Tell me, how else should it, how else should it be?

[Part 1: Ski Aggu]  
I feel differently cool, yeah, I set myself up in a new way  
I stand at the gas station, but I'm filling up on white wine  
City boys and everyone is wasted  
We don't cook potato pasta, but we make ourselves knocki  
Oh-oh-oh my God, Charlotte tells me I'm super hot  
Chill Club OST, non-stop to the bar for shots  
For the whole crew, yeah  
And when the cash runs out, someone else will pay  
Do you feel what I mean? Brothers are here, yeah  
Sisters are with me in the wild west of Berlin  
Come out of the club at noon, but just stay outside  
Head to Mauerpark for the flea market and buy clothes from the 2000s

[Hook: Paul]  
(I’m) I'm on my way, no time to lose  
Picaldi jeans in light blue from 2004  
Yeah, a lot has changed, yet we stay right here  
Tell me, how else should it, how else should it be?  
No time to lose  
Picaldi jeans in light blue from 2004  
Yeah, a lot has changed, yet we stay right here  
Tell me, how else should it, how else should it be?

[Part 2: Paul]  
Tell me, how else should it be?  
Someday I'll be sensible, but I've still got a few years  
Why should I be somewhere else?  
In my street, there's two-fifty wine at the corner store, and I share  
O-o-one station on the train  
But we accidentally went too far  
'Cause I fly high again like a hawk with prey  
Classic Thursday night  
Walking through my neighborhood and staying here  
Come with us and I'll show you  
We’re strays in Nikes and 90s jeans

[Bridge: Paul]  
I've got my boys and I've got my girls  
Hear a garbage truck and realize it's late  
One 030, one 01099  
Look up at the sky and the black is slowly turning blue

[Hook: Paul]  
I'm on my way, no time to lose  
Picaldi jeans in light blue from 2004  
Yeah, a lot has changed, yet we stay right here  
Tell me, how else should it, how else should it be?  
No time to lose  
Picaldi jeans in light blue from 2004  
Yeah, a lot has changed, yet we stay right here  
Tell me, how else should it, how else should it be?
