**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Kris]  
I love these days  
I love these days  

[Verse 1: Kris]  
It's seven-thirty, the sun is shining  
The sky is blue, baby, that's how it should be  
I pack my things, today we're heading to the beach  
Time has flown by way too fast lately  

Thoughts like ghosts and dark clouds  
That have been haunting me for a while  
Are gone for good starting today  
Life has me back, today is perfect  

I listen to my favorite songs on repeat  
Reminding me of colorful times  
My life is a party, nothing bothers me anymore  
From now on, it’s loud, 'cause quiet can't be heard  
'Cause quiet can't be heard  

[Chorus: Kris & Dante Thomas]  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun  

[Verse 2: Kris]  
I burn my old life in the backyard  
I’m running again, getting fit, now it begins  
Never ordering fast food again, only homemade meals  
Enjoy the day, stop stressing yourself out  

I don’t care about my lyrics, sitting in the studio  
Making everything new, everything better, raising the roof  
No boss, no appointments, everything flows naturally  
The perfect world  

[Chorus: Kris & Dante Thomas]  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun  

[Bridge: Dante Thomas]  
Ooh, ohh  
Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster of love  
Some people call me Mr. California  
That's when I sing, when I speak, it's like the rise of the sun  

[Chorus: Kris & Dante Thomas]  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun  
I love these days  
No matter how bad it was  
I don't want to complain  
I love these days  
Playing my music in the sun
