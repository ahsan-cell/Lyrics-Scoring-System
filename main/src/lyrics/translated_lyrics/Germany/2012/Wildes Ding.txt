**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yeah!

[Part 1: Itchyban]  
She was a death metal rocker girl, bittersweet and full of dirt  
The kind of girl who could knock you off your feet with a stool  
She loved head-banging, I b-b-banged along  
While gazing at the stars, we enjoyed Rammstein and Kiss  
She constantly drank me under the table, always downing shots  
On her backside, it was sharply tattooed “666”

[Pre-Hook: Larsito]  
I just want one with heart, brains, curves, and flair  
Outside princesses and a freak in my bed  
A little bit lady, a little bit crazy  
That’s what I’d find perfect

[Hook: Itchyban]  
I need a wild thing (oh yeah)  
Looking for a wild thing (o-oh yeah)  
I need a wild thing (oh yeah)  
And she says: “Hey sweetie, just look how wild I am!”

[Part 2: Johnny Strange]  
She was a fully vegan, spiritual hippie  
Wanted to fight for freedom with me  
Baked the best hash cookies  
I should hitchhike to Jamaica with her  
Her hobby was Kamasutra power meditating  
Demonstrating for organic farmers, she wanted to study yoga  
My friends said I must be out of my mind  
But she was my dancehall queen, we danced barefoot in the club

[Pre-Hook: Larsito]  
I just want one with heart, brains, curves, and flair  
Outside princesses and a freak in my bed  
A little bit lady, a little bit crazy  
That’s what I’d find perfect

[Hook: Itchyban]  
I need a wild thing (oh yeah)  
Looking for a wild thing (o-oh yeah)  
I need a wild thing (oh yeah)  
And she says: “Hey sweetie, just look how wild I am!”

[Post-Hook: Itchyban]  
W-W-W-Wild thing!  
W-W-W-Wild thing!  
W-W-W-Wild thing!  
W-W-W-Wild thing!

[Part 3: Mr. Reedoo]  
She was a business law student  
Well-groomed from a wealthy family  
Shopping was her only hobby  
She burned through my inheritance  
Quick coffee on the Champs-Élysées  
Then posing in Davos in the powder snow  
After our candlelight dinner by the lake  
The little mouse pulls out her whip – and starts swinging!

[Pre-Hook: Larsito]  
I just want one with heart, brains, curves, and flair  
Outside princesses and a freak in my bed  
A little bit lady, a little bit crazy  
That’s what I’d find perfect

[Hook: Itchyban]  
I need a wild thing (oh yeah)  
Looking for a wild thing (o-oh yeah)  
I need a wild thing (oh yeah)  
And she says: “Hey sweetie, just look how wild I am!”

[Post-Hook: Itchyban]  
W-W-W-Wild thing!  
W-W-W-Wild thing!  
W-W-W-Wild thing!  
W-W-W-Wild thing!

I need a wild thing!
