**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I am lost in your center  
You make me a fighter without a shield  
Everything turned upside down, senses like hazy  
I am so hopelessly drunk on you  
You warm me up with your essence  
And leave not a single inch unscathed  
You flood all my decks with hope  
For a real life before death  

[Chorus]  
And yes, I breathe you in  
Yes, I burn for you  
And yes, I live for you every day  
And yes, you reflect me  
And yes, I swear by you in every fiber of my being, yes  

[Verse 2]  
It’s still so hard to believe  
How you overlook most of my mistakes  
You ground every one of my thoughts  
Granting wings when doubt prevails  

[Chorus]  
And yes, I breathe you in  
Yes, I burn for you  
And yes, I live for you every day  
And yes, you reflect me  
And yes, I swear by you in every fiber of my being, yes  

[Bridge]  
“Yes” to every day with you  
“Yes” to every one of your flaws  
Ashes and gold, I carry it all with you  
For I am and will remain lost in your center  
In your center until the curtain falls  

[Chorus]  
And yes, I breathe you in  
Yes, I burn for you  
And yes, I live for you every day  
And yes, you reflect me  
And yes, I swear by you in every fiber of my being, yes
