**Translated Lyrics:**

Tram or on my moped  
Or taking the train in black  
I was always somehow chasing after you  
No, back then I never missed a concert of yours  
And at night I couldn't sleep  
Or if I did, I dreamed of you  

**[Chorus: Clueso]**  
You played the cello  
In every hall around our area  
I always sat in the front row  
And found you so exciting  
Cello  
You were a goddess to me  
And sometimes you looked at me  
And I thought, "Oh man"  
And then I was completely overwhelmed  
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  

**[Verse 3: Clueso & Udo Lindenberg]**  
Yes, I was always there and that convinced you  
We always wanted to stay together  
And overall, being with you was so grand  
It's something you can't even describe  
And today you live somewhere else  
And your cello is in the basement  
Come on, take it out again  
And play as beautifully as before, yeah  

**[Chorus]**  
You played the cello  
In every hall around our area  
I always sat in the front row  
And found you so exciting  
Cello  
You were a goddess to me  
And sometimes you looked at me  
And I thought, "Oh man"  
And then I was completely overwhelmed  

**[Outro: Clueso]**  
You played the cello  
Even in Chicago  
I was there  
You were there  
We are here
