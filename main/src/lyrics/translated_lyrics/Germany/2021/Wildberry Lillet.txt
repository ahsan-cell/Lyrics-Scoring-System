**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
For breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet  

[Hook]  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
I’m hungry, so I’ll take everything from the buffet  
I want a house for my mom on the coast of Catania  
For breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
I’m hungry, so I’ll take everything from the buffet  
I want a house for my mom on the coast of Catania  
For breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet  

[Part 1]  
I want to rise up, I want to go to Mars  
Spaceship with a panoramic view  
Always the best for my closest friends  
I’ll buy the world and no one pays  
I don’t want to grow old  
Time should stand still for me  
I don’t want to wait  
I want to see your face when I wake up  

[Pre-Hook]  
Private jet in the garage and flamingos in my garden  
I want the best cards at the table, I want to have, have, have  
I want stacks of purple, I want Nina on posters  
I want all my friends to live on my street  

[Hook]  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
I’m hungry, so I’ll take everything from the buffet  
I want a house for my mom on the coast of Catania  
For breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet  

[Part 2]  
Ocean view and beach waves, I’ll get myself an island  
Somewhere in the South Seas, where no one can find us  

[Pre-Hook]  
Private spa on four floors, bathing in champagne pools  
I want everything for free forever, I want to have, have, have  
I want stacks of purple, I want Nina on posters  
I want all my friends to live on my street  

[Hook]  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
I’m hungry, so I’ll take everything from the buffet  
I want a house for my mom on the coast of Catania  
For breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
Hey, for breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet  

[Outro]  
I want properties, I want dollars, I want to fly like in Marvel  
For breakfast, canapés and a wildberry Lillet
