**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: makko & Loredana]  
When the others leave the house  
(Miksu)  
(Macloud)  

[Part 1: makko]  
I only come home when the others leave the house  
Sleep rhythm messed up, I see the sun always rising  
Babe, I'm in love with your style and your looks  
Can you take me home? I can barely see straight  

[Hook: makko]  
'Cause I'm awake at night, messed up, Babe, I know you hate that  
I hit up my plug, ask him if he has some hash  
Don't know what I was thinking  
I throw everything away just because I have it in my hands  
Yeah, I'm awake at night, messed up, Babe, I know you hate that  
I hit up my plug, ask him if he has some hash  
Don't know what I was thinking  
I throw everything away just because I have it in my hands  

[Part 2: makko]  
I have deep dark circles, yeah, from a thousand things  
I think I'll be okay, even if I don't sound like it right now  
I've been through so much, so it's no wonder that I sing  
She tells me she loves me and the pain in my voice  
Ah, I'm searching for hell in my heaven  
Yeah, my baby sharp as a blade  
My vision blurs every evening  
And I believe many things help, but sadly not glasses  

[Pre-Hook: makko]  
I drink gin like it's water  
Wounds too deep, yeah, I believe no bandage will help anymore, ah  
I'm pretty drunk, but I always feel empty  
When was the last time I was home? It's been a long time  

[Hook: makko]  
'Cause I'm awake at night, messed up, Babe, I know you hate that  
I hit up my plug, ask him if he has some hash  
Don't know what I was thinking  
I throw everything away just because I have it in my hands  
Yeah, I'm awake at night, messed up, Babe, I know you hate that  
I hit up my plug, ask him if he has some hash  
Don't know what I was thinking  
I throw everything away just because I have it in my hands  

[Part 3: makko]  
I'm awake at night, puff-puff, pass out with the crew  
I get out of the Uber, greet my brother with a handshake  
Don't need sleep anymore, 'cause I chase dreams every day  
Grateful for what is and also broken from what once was, yeah  

[Pre-Hook: makko]  
I mix feelings with alcohol and all that other stuff  
Yeah, they call me makko, even though that's not my real name  
I'm never there, I'm sorry in a different way, yeah  
And when I come home tomorrow, Baby, I'll definitely be high in a different way  

[Hook: makko]  
'Cause I'm awake at night, messed up, Babe, I know you hate that  
I hit up my plug, ask him if he has some hash  
Don't know what I was thinking  
I throw everything away just because I have it in my hands
