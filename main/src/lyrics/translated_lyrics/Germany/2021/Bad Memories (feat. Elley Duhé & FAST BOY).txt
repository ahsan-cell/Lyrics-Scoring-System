**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: FAST BOY]  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
Tonight we're going to make bad memories  
"One more drink," she said  
We know there's no turning back now  
We love making bad memories  

[Chorus: FAST BOY]  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
Tonight we're going to make bad memories  
"One more drink," she said  
We know there's no turning back now  
We love making bad memories  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
Tonight we're going to make bad memories  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  

[Post-Chorus: FAST BOY]  
I think I'm losing my mind now, losing my head  
Losing my head now, losing my head  
I think I'm losing my head now, losing my head  
Over and over  

[Bridge: Elley Duhé & FAST BOY]  
"One more drink," he said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
Tonight we're going to make bad memories  
"One more drink," he said  
And, baby, you confuse me  
We're face to face  
To do it again, again  
Over and over  
We'll do it again, again  
Over and over  

[Chorus: FAST BOY & Elley Duhé]  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
Tonight we're going to make bad memories  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  

[Post-Chorus: FAST BOY & Elley Duhé]  
I think I'm losing my mind now, losing my head  
Losing my head now, losing my head  
I think I'm losing my head now, losing my head  
Over and over  

[Chorus: FAST BOY]  
"One more drink," she said  
I think I'm losing my mind now  
Tonight we're going to make bad memories  
"One more drink," she said  
We know there's no turning back now  
We love making bad memories
