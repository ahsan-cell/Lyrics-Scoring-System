**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Tell me how we do this  
If you want me and I want you too  
I've been wanting to have you for a while  
So what’s the plan?  
Put on a dembow, it doesn’t hold back  
I’ve got the whole package for you  
I haven’t been single for long  
So take advantage of me  

[Chorus]  
And I won’t wrap you up  
I know we’ll do it and you’ll come back (Come back)  
A little grinding against the wall  
I’m a case that needs solving  
But I won’t wrap you up  
I know we’ll do it and you’ll come back (Come back)  
A little grinding just for fun  
Stuck against the wall (Stuck against the wall)  

[Verse 2]  
Bottles and smoke  
With you in a capsule  
Because every time I see you (Oh, oh)  
You want to dance and I want to break you down  
Take it as a joke  
And in five minutes, you’ll be coming  
You’ve got me melting for you  
Only God knows what you did to me  
Take it as a joke  
And in five minutes, you’ll be coming  
You’ve got me melting for you  
Only God knows what you did to me  

[Chorus]  
And I won’t wrap you up  
I know we’ll do it and you’ll come back (Come back)  
A little grinding against the wall  
I’m a case that needs solving  
But I won’t wrap you up  
I know we’ll do it and you’ll come back (Come back)  
A little grinding just for fun  
Stuck against the wall (Stuck against the wall)  

[Bridge]  
Sex and alcohol  
What happens here stays here  
I know you won’t forget me  
If I make love to you, if I make love to you  
Sex and alcohol  
What happens here stays here (Stays here)  
I know you won’t forget me  
If I make love to you, if I make love to you  

[Chorus]  
And I won’t wrap you up  
I know we’ll do it and you’ll come back (Come back)  
A little grinding against the wall  
I’m a case that needs solving  
But I won’t wrap you up  
I know we’ll do it and you’ll come back (Come back)  
A little grinding just for fun  
Stuck against the wall  

[Outro]  
Bottles and smoke  
With you in a capsule  
Because every time I see you  
You want to dance and I want to break you down  
Bottles and smoke  
With you in a capsule  
Because every time I see you  
You want to dance and I want to break you down  
Tell me how we do this  
If you desire me and I desire you too  
I've been wanting to have you for a while  
So what are you going to do?
