**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  

[Verse 1]  
You think you can flex with one-kilo weights?  
The main goal: to go viral, Resident Evil  
Caught live, I’ll smash your face like a pug  
Sorry, but weren’t you tripping because you were a mastiff?  
You’re looking for work, not searching for love  
If you seek me, you’ll find me behind you, working hard like Cecchi Paone*  
You can’t even sign your name, like putting an asterisk  
I don’t know who you are, like Sfera Ebbasta with Sangue Misto**  
Here we party all night, but I don’t care  
Indifferent, distrustful of these rappers who fall, rotten apples  
Tales of the bad streets, you shouldn’t  
I’ll smash your car with a pickaxe, Jordan Jeffrey  
But then you’ll arrest me, rapper guard  
Snitches, but I’ve got some annoying friends  
So, man, watch your back  
At first glance, you seem limited  
I’m a verified artist, you’re a very stuck artist  
Your makeup’s running, emo, tears of Marini***  
I’ll make you so black that Salvini will ring your doorbell (Ah, ding dong)  
By now, you can’t turn back  
Panic around me like a Muslim on the subway (Ah)  
Silence in the room, those who don’t speak agree  
Even if it’s counterproductive like someone silent at a call center  
Splatter over time, feel a horror chorus  
Sorry, man, I crush rappers like shrimp, Boro Boro  
“I’m more swag than you, I have more followers than you  
The girls who won’t leave me alone in the VIP”  
You set the autotune wrong, then you’re off-key  
I’ve got Tolstoy inside me, you’re stuck in Toy Story, what the fuck?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  
Da-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-ra-da-da  

[Chorus]  
You want to blow up on social media (Fuck it)  
But everything comes back like a boomerang (Don’t you know?)  
Everything comes back like a boomerang (And you know it)  
Everything comes back like a boomerang  
You want to blow up on social media (Fuck it)  
But everything comes back like a boomerang (Don’t you know?)  
Everything comes back like a boomerang (And you know it)  
Everything comes back like a boomerang  

[Verse 2]  
You hate me because you hate the truth  
Maddy on the attack like Teddy Sheringham  
She might have two hundred thousand fans  
But Google Translate can go screw itself  
If I copy and paste a text from Madame (Fuck off)  
Influencer on trap, the lesser evil  
The new wave is the TikTok girls (Oh shit)  
Videos of fifteen-year-olds that look like strip poker  
Still acne on their cheeks, I’m having fun, you know? Not bothered (Ehm)  
The web is a wheelbarrow that even a fool can push  
If you want the maximum trash, there’s Er Faina on Temptation Island (Ahahahah)  
I’m sorry  
Claudia Stella trying to straighten Andrea Diprè’s dick, but she can’t  
Loading my Winchester with buckshot  
No comparisons, you’re Mickey Mouse against Mick Jagger  
Music is dead in a mess (Uh)  
The situation burns like in a tanning salon  
How many beggars  
I’d like to see Social Boom crawling  
Sleeping among cardboard boxes  
You’ve taken off the nail polish, put on a mask  
A queen who’s never licked the runway  
If I were there, I’d be coughing from Makatussin****  
Sometimes I feel like coughing too  
I should try it, I should find it  
Okay, I could order it  
It snows, those who get high faint  
Rockstar, Post Malone, 21 Savage  
Lil Uzi, Lil Pump, Lil Yachty, Kodak Black  
Young Thug, Lil' Boosie, Lil Xan, mumble rap  
The rhymes close old school  
While the legs open like Malena  
The scene is like a seesaw, if you want a career  
Sing "Guantanamera," as Gallagher says: "In chains, in chains"  
At Fantamorto they already give me ten to one  
They’ll
