**[Verse]**  
Hey, where has my yogurt gone?  
I've been looking forward to it for ages  
No yogurt in sight  
I know for sure it was there  
It makes no sense  
There are no witnesses, and no one knows  
I hope you feel sorry  
I, I hope you feel sorry (mhmhm)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Who among you stole my dessert?  
I really hope it was worth it  
Someone emptied it out  
I just want my yogurt  
How can one bear this pain?  
Just think how it would feel for you  
Apologies won’t change anything now  
That was my last yogurt  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i  
That was your last yogurt  
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i  
That was my last yogurt  
Oh—i—oh—i—oh—i—oh—i  
This is not product placement  
Apologies won’t change anything now  
I was really looking forward to it

**[Chorus]**  
What was the name again?  
I can't take it anymore  
Can you, when I ask you,  
Say your name one more time, name again?  
Say your name one more time, name again?  

**[Verse]**  
Was it Linus or Bennet, Phil, Tom, or Frank?  
Dennis? I really don’t know  
Alex, Leon, Nico, Jan, or Mark?  
Ron, Emilio, Kilian, or Bastian  
Definitely not Sean, Rick, or Hamed  
Nina would be too typical a girl’s name  
Ming or Zack, I forgot your name  
What a mess, or wait, was it maybe Ahmed?  
Eddie, Hugo, Tino, Timo, or Hartmut?  
Fritz, Ingo, Ronald McDonald, no, that was fast food  
Franklin, Elias, Evan, Udo, Milan, Raouf, Chris  
Jens, Olaf, Niklas, Tim, or Dave weren’t it either  
Ali, Oskar, Manu Kosta  
Moritz, Anton, Simon, Felix, Thomas, or Joschka?  
Stefan, Justus, Jonas, Bob, Peter, Hans, or Jauch?  
Damn, I messed up, man, I can’t remember

**[Verse]**  
I overslept and don’t want to get up  
I’m so tired, it’s early  
Why do I have to go out?  
I turn around, don’t want to rush  
Just a moment of peace, close my eyes, just five more minutes  
Then I realize  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Oh, crap, I’m really running late  
Hopefully, it’s not too late, then  
Maybe I can still catch the bus  
If I run now, I might just make it  
It’s getting really tight now, because  
I see the bus, and it’s just leaving  

**[Chorus]**  
Missed the bus, I missed the bus  
I thought I’d catch it  
Missed the bus, I missed the bus  
Now I need a taxi  
Missed the bus, I missed the bus  
I thought I’d catch it  
Missed the bus, I missed the bus  
Now I need a taxi

**[Verse]**  
Tired, I push Mom’s fully loaded shopping cart  
Oh no, not another bag  
We’re at the checkout, and I hear her say  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
That we’re out of milk, she miscounted  
She runs off quickly, what is she thinking?  
Leaving me here alone, with the line behind me  
Mom, don’t do that? Please, don’t do that?  

**[Chorus]**  
You can’t leave now, leave, leave, leave, leave  
Don’t leave me standing here, standing, standing, standing  
Can’t you see, see, see, see  
We’re almost up to pay  
Don’t leave me alone, -one, -one, -one  
The checkout is free, free, free, free  
I have no money with me, -me, -me, -me  
Mom, don’t do this to me  
Don’t leave me alone

**[Verse]**  
Every day streaming YouTube, ah  
These people disgust me, ah  
I don’t subscribe to anyone, ah  
I watch your videos anyway, ah  
Hopefully, I hurt you, man, ah  
I can speak good German, as you can see, yah  
Grammar Nazis can’t teach me,
