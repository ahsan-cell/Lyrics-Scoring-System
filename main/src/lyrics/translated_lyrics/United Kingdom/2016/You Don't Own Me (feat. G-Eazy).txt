**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: SAYGRACE & G-Eazy]  
You don't own me (Oh, oh, mm, mm)  
I don't belong to you (Oh, oh, mm, mm)  
Well, let's go (Oh)  

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]  
But I'm Gerald (Yeah)  
And I can always get what I want (Want)  
She's so cool, I'd love to show her off in public  
Take her shopping, you know, at Yves Saint Laurent  
But no, she wouldn't agree  
It's all because she has her own money  
She's her own boss, if you haven't figured it out  
She'll never be a plaything  

[Verse 2: SAYGRACE]  
You don't own me  
I'm not one of your many toys  
You don't own me  
Don't say I can't date other guys  

[Chorus: SAYGRACE]  
Don't tell me what to do  
And don't tell me what to say  
Please, when I go out with you  
Don't put me on display  

[Verse 3: SAYGRACE]  
You don't own me  
And don't try to change me  
You don't own me  
Don't tie me down, 'cause I will never stay  

[Chorus: SAYGRACE]  
Don't tell me what to do  
And don't tell me what to say  
Please, when I go out with you  
Don't put me on display  

[Verse 4: G-Eazy & SAYGRACE]  
Though, to be honest  
I'm tired of the usual... (No)  
She's the coolest, downright wicked, texting her  
Asking if she's alone and can send a couple pics  
But she said no (What?), damn (Damn)  
She said, come over and see for yourself  
She'll never ask for your help  
Such an independent woman, you can't put her on a shelf like a trophy  
No (No), she's one of a kind  
We smoke together until... (Ah)  
We don't sleep until dawn  
The coolest, I swear, she's better than anyone I've seen (Yeah)  
Never borrows and never lends  
And then she said she'll never, ever, ever be my possession  

[Bridge: SAYGRACE]  
I'm not telling you what to say  
I'm not telling you what to do  
So just let me be myself  
That's all I ask of you  
I'm young and I like being young  
I'm free and I like being free  
I like living how I want  
Saying and doing whatever I please (Ha, hey)  

[Outro: SAYGRACE & G-Eazy]  
You don't own me  
Oh, no, alright, oh, no, no  
I don't belong to you  
Oh, no, no, no, you don't own, you don't own, hey  
You don't own me  
But know, you've never met someone like me  
No, no, no, no, no, no  
You don't own me  
No, no, Eazy  
You don't own me
