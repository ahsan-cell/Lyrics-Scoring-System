**Translated Lyrics:**

I love your style, baby

[Verse 1: Drake]  
Hands on my waist  
Back and forth  
You know I’m not pretending  
The streets aren’t safe  
But I’ve never run away  
Even if I’m far away  
No, no, there’s never enough love outside the city  
I’m praying to come back whole  
I’m praying, I’m praying  

[Chorus: Drake]  
So I need a dance  
I’ve got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time before I go  
Higher powers are holding me  
I need a dance  
I’ve got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time before I go  
Higher powers are holding me  

[Bridge: Kyla]  
I love your style, baby  

[Verse 2: Drake]  
Power and control  
That’s all I wish for my friends  
No one from my neighborhood can do this  
I had to break the silence  
You know you have to stay by my side  
Respond to me as soon as you see the message  
I don’t want to waste time fighting  
We have no time  

[Chorus: Drake]  
So I need a dance  
I’ve got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time before I go  
Higher powers are holding me  
I need a dance  
I’ve got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time before I go  
Higher powers are holding me  

[Break: Wizkid]  
There’s a beautiful girl and she’s loved me for a long time  
Dance, dance, for a long time  
Oh yes, for a long time  
Go back, go back, go back and dance  
Go back, go back, go back and dance, baby  
Go back, go back, go back and dance  
Oh yes, for a long time  
Go back, go back, go back and dance, baby  

[Bridge: Kyla + Wizkid]  
Tell me  
I need to know, where do you want to go?  
Because if you want, I can slow down  
It makes you lose control  
Where, where, where  
Where, where, where, where  
Oh yes, for a long time  
Where, where, where  
Go back, go back and dance, baby  
Where, where, where, where  
Because if you want  
Go back, go back and  
Because if you want  
Go back, go back and  
Because if you want  
Go back, go back and  

[Chorus: Drake]  
So I need a dance  
I’ve got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time before I go  
Higher powers are holding me  
I need a dance  
I’ve got a Hennessy in my hand  
One more time before I go  
Higher powers are holding me
