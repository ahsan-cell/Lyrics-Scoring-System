**[Chorus]**  
Whoopty  
Bitch, I'm outside, it's a movie (Whoopty), huh  
Blue cheese  
I swear I'm hooked on blue cheese  
I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf (Huh)  
Bitch, I'm all about my chicken like it's a two-piece  
You can have your girl back, she's a groupie  
She just took care of all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)  
Swagged out  
For Milly, we’re bringing the heat out  
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house  
Off the '42, I'm making her back arch (Making her back arch)  
I'm back on my nonsense, ready to retaliate with a full clip  
They say I'm moving ruthless  
And my shooters, they’re shooting  
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris (And my shooters, they’re shooting), damn  

**[Verse]**  
I get the cash, then it's goodbye  
If I'm with your girl, then she's giving me head  
When I see the police, we lay low (When I see the police)  
That's another piece, that's another Zoe  
Ice in the diamonds, now she’s ready to get wild (Ice in the diamonds)  
I got all this water on me like FIJI  
Bitch, I'm chilling with Hats and the Sleezys  
Smoking the zaza, it goes straight to my head  
Then I'm pulling out the chopper  
I'm hitting the cha-cha, open his can  
Then he’s dancing bachata  

**[Bridge]**  
Smoking the zaza, it goes straight to my head  
Then I'm pulling out the chopper  
I'm hitting the cha-cha, then I open his can  
Then he’s dancing bachata  

**[Chorus]**  
Whoopty  
Bitch, I'm outside, it's a movie (Whoopty), huh  
Blue cheese  
I swear I'm hooked on blue cheese  
I gotta stick to this paper like loose leaf (Huh)  
Bitch, I'm all about my chicken like it's a two-piece  
You can have your girl back, she's a groupie  
She just took care of all my kids in the two-seat (Gag)  
Swagged out  
For Milly, we’re bringing the heat out (Heat)  
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house  
Off the '42, I'm making her back arch (Making her back arch)  
I'm back on my nonsense, ready to retaliate with a full clip  
They say I'm moving ruthless  
And my shooters, they’re shooting  
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris (And my shooters, they’re shooting, ayy)  

**[Outro]**  
Swagged out  
For Milly, we’re bringing the heat out  
I still got some racks stuffed in the trap house  
Off the '42, I'm making her back arch (Making her back arch)  
I'm back on my nonsense, ready to retaliate with a full clip  
They say I'm moving ruthless  
And my shooters, they’re shooting  
I won't take her to Ruth's Chris (And my shooters, they’re shooting)
