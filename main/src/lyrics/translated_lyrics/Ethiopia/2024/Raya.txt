**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Montano]  
I don’t need you to stay  
But I don’t want you to go away  
I watch the way you move, crossing all the lines  

[Verse: Dekko]  
Bold girl (Bold girl)  
It’s a shame those curves are shared (Shared)  
With me, you turn into a total wild one, see it, see it  
You always feel fresh here  
You’ve killed my desire  
Let’s just be friends, baby  

[Verse 1: Beele]  
Baby, you have everything I like  
You enjoy being bold with me  
Even on FaceTime, you tell me what you’ll do  
The movie started, but we won’t even watch it  
So bad, it shows on your face  
With me, she flies and feels so good  
I’m diving in headfirst, I’m clear about that  
We do it, and it’s not my secret  

[Chorus: Montano]  
Bold girl (Bold girl)  
It’s a shame those curves are shared (Shared)  
With me, you turn into a total wild one, see it, see it  
You always feel fresh here  
You’ve killed my desire  
Let’s just be friends, baby (Lady)  

[Verse 2: Dekko]  
We’re street friends (Wuh)  
Call me if you want me to vibe with you (Yih)  
Don’t expect any details from me  
I’m not here for love, just for your mischief (Nah, nah-nah)  
Beautiful, you, my love, you’re too beautiful, baby  
Every time, you’ve got swag up in the sky  
Come here, you’re messing up with De-Dekko, yih-eh  

[Bridge: Beele & Dekko, Both]  
You don’t want me, I don’t want you, but no one like you  
I’ve had many women, but no one like you  
I’ve seen many bold ones, but no one like you  
Baby, no one, baby, no one, baby, no one like you  
Uh, nah-nah, nah-nah (Bold girl)  
Uh, nah-nah, nah-nah (Bold girl)  
Uh, nah-nah, nah-nah (You’re the bold one)  
Uh, nah-nah  

[Verse 3: Montano]  
She says, she says (Hah)  
She doesn’t want me to stop  
Wants me to record while we’re doing it  
I know you’ve got the attitude in spades  
And I’ll give you everything, even the coffin, hah (Muah)  
Bold, bold girl, how I love having you on top (Uah)  
Little one with the big booty  
I want you for myself, not for anyone else  

[Pre-Chorus: Beele & Dekko]  
Yih-eh  
You don’t want me, I don’t want you, but no one like you  
I’ve had many women, but no one like you  
I’ve seen many bold ones, but no one like you  
Baby, no one, baby, no one, baby, no one like you  

[Chorus: Beele & Dekko]  
Bold girl  
It’s a shame those curves are shared (Shared)  
With me, you turn into a total wild one, see it, see it  
You always feel fresh here  
You’ve killed my desire, let’s just be friends, baby  

[Refrain: Montano]  
I don’t need you to stay  
But I don’t want you to go away (Wuh)  
I watch the way you move, crossing all the lines  

[Outro: Beele, Dekko, Montano]  
Yeah  
She says, she says  
Montano, Montano  
Yih-eh, Dekko, De-Dekko
