**Translated Lyrics:**

How much can I achieve, yeah...

They won't tear everything out of me  
They won't see me broken again  
They can't reach me, where I am, yeah yeah...

They won't find a way to me  
They won't take away my faith  
They want to look down on me again, no, no...

But I know I'll find strength within me  
And I'll reach the sky, just to spite them, just to spite them  
Oh yes, I know the power will be with me  
How much can I achieve  
How much can I achieve

There's so much love inside me  
There's still a reason to stay  
And I find the will every day, yeah yeah...

There are people like you and me  
We'll stand strong â€“ I fight against it  
Who does it depend on? Yes, on you and me, yeah...

But I know you'll find strength in me  
And I'll reach the sky, just to spite them, just to spite them  
Oh yes, I know the power will be with you  
How much can we achieve  
How much can we achieve

I see there's meaning  
In fighting with you, and know  
How much we can achieve  
Yes, we can achieve
