---

If you say I’m not good for you,
It’s not true, knowing you won’t hurt me.
Don’t treat me like I’m just anyone,
What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one who should be comforting me (for me).
A tease (a tease), don’t let it deceive you.
What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one I need (for me).
A tease (a tease), a tease, I’m yours.

Though I’m a fool (though I’m a fool), if you don’t care, don’t say it (if you don’t care, don’t say it).
For the weak-hearted, it doesn’t reach the stomach that’s hungry.
For this, for this, if someone calls you a friend,
What can your mouth do to me?
I can’t bear your pain,
Even if I’m here, here,
Your silence screams, I hear it.
The world has turned against me, I know it.
Even if I’m here, I know it’s hard for you.
Even if you don’t want to show it,
Your pain is now my pain.

What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one who should be comforting me (for me).
A tease (a tease), don’t let it deceive you.
What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one I need (for me).
A tease (a tease), a tease, I’m yours.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.
You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the one.

You might also like: 
I can’t say it, I’m stuck,
As if I’m far away, my eyes don’t see.
My ears don’t hear at all,
It’s her own business, I can’t grasp it.
I can’t understand, I’m lost in thought,
Your words are like a distant echo.
Even if it’s not meant to be,
The solution doesn’t come easily.
What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one who should be comforting me (for me).
A tease (a tease), don’t let it deceive you.
What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one I need (for me).
A tease (a tease), a tease, I’m yours.

What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one who should be comforting me (for me).
A tease (a tease), don’t let it deceive you (a tease).
What’s the point of your tears (for me)?
You’re the one I need (for me).
A tease (a tease), a tease, I’m yours.
What’s the point of your tears?
You’re the one who should be comforting me (you’re the one I need).
