**[Verse 1: Berqutes]**  
I've got a few bucks in my pocket,  
If you have money, pay the rent.  
We burned it down with hemp cigarettes,  
You stirred up a fuss, it went wild.  
I didn’t conform to the laws, son,  
You lost your mind (went crazy!)  
From wall to wall,  
You said you'd donate to the institutions,  
You aimed for the bonus, betting on gambling.  
You got high with pills,  
Filled with hate for those sneezing on the street.  
Call the police!  
Wounded wing!  
A view before you!  
My face is blackened!  
From the start, it’s dark!  
Take my bleeding ear to the doctor.  
Jump as high as you can,  
Jump as much as possible,  
If I fall, I’ll be in execution.  
You couldn’t compare the divine with abstractions,  
They’ll cut off your bill (yours),  
They’ll finish your work, this is the last line!

**[Verse 2: Han]**  
Who’s this?  
Recognize me, hit the catch button.  
Ask me, you didn’t get the topic.  
Find the subject,  
Let’s talk.  
I’m capital, you’re ordinary.  
Come, get to know me,  
Grab your pants, run!  
We come large to you,  
Don’t even turn your back.  
(?) Your toxicity won’t wrap us.  
Just a bit further, do your envy.  
Fuck you, cry ever baby (ha?)  
Your enemy, take your diaper and go, cry.  
Keep your diaper for yourself.  
I gave the mic to Dark.  
Ya ya ya ya ya.

**[Verse 3: Darkxburak]**  
He writes verse by verse, getting ambitious,  
I’ll catch him tight, don’t get mad.  
Let me make you a rap reform,  
Don’t break what I’ve written, it’s not a secret or anything.  
Don’t do that,  
Mind’s gone astray.  
If there’s an original, it’s against the opposite.  
Same pains,  
Different bandages.  
Don’t dive into the mic like asthma.  
Something different is needed.  
What you call different is just the other side of the same.  
The logic you burned calmed down, confused the reasoning.  
The condition is illogical, what kind of logic is this?  
Still pretentious,  
If it were true, it would be a lie.  
If it remembers, it’s a lie.  
Anyway, it’s all a lie.  
Every day, every hour, a lie.  
Every word, every beat, every side, a lie.  
Can’t take the goods!  
Is this art you’re doing? The mind gets stuck, doesn’t understand the words, fool.  
I wrote at the highest level without backing down.  
Kids clash head-on,  
Bald heads, we’re all one of us.  
One of us is equal to all of us.  
Our hands reach, are we crazy or not?  
If it pleases me, we’re all crazy.  
They talk behind me,  
I think they swore again without nonsense.  
Echoes come to my brain, tight but,  
Without living, parasites don’t understand the words.  
Each one is a counterpart to the clowns,  
Each one comes to each other.  
The sly hides their business under that guise,  
Who knows what lies deep beneath what they bow to?

**[Outro]**  
Berqutes: Jump as high as you can!  
Berqutes: Jump as much as possible!  
Darkxburak: Dude, the song is over.  
Berqutes: What (laughing)?
