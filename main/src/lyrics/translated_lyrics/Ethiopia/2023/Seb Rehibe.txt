**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1**  
Who am I to say when and how?  
That barren place is now where yesterday lived.  
How can I bear this pain, when I've gained so much?  
What I couldn't understand, we call it pain.  
I am a sinner, my body empty, my mind empty,  
But the weight of his curtain, what story should I write?  
Where did youth get robbed?  
Where did the writer stop?  
I've seen since childhood, but why am I surprised now?  
Yeah.  
Tell me, what’s the significance of your birthday?  
If wisdom connects with age, then it’s all good.  
Your resting place is the grave, so worship, oh heedless one,  
If you were born a Muslim, don’t die a non-believer.  
Spread the sheet, take some rations,  
Only he who respects will listen to the sermon.  
I’m ahead of my time, and time deceives,  
Show-off is part of joy or even mourning.  
I address myself,  
In opposition to my essence,  
Against myself,  
And it’s necessary to confront.  
Listen to my words, Zahid, just Hashim.  
I have no status, that’s why I’m beyond status.  
What is my existence? Speak.  
What’s the proof in words? Weigh it.  
I swear, I’m innocent,  
Emotional words come out, I don’t know why?  
What should I do with them?  
Affected by a rapper's words,  
Not by the rapper,  
My effort is genuine, not hypocritical on my records.  
Unanswered questions arise,  
She asks, what does respect mean, what about honor?

**Pre-Chorus**  
Hashim, bow your head,  
You know, whether you know or not,  
What do you gain from prostration?  
God will take revenge, calling you.  
Yeah.  
Humans don’t understand,  
Searching for morning in the nights,  
Stay awake at night,  
Who knows when the Almighty will reconcile?

**Chorus**  
You don’t know (don’t know)  
What’s in your heart?  
Where are you? (Where are you?)  
Which paths have you walked?  
Where have you lost everything?  
What have you gained, who knows?  
Where have you lost everything?  
What have you gained, who knows?  
You don’t know (don’t know)  
What’s in your heart?  
Where are you? (Where are you?)  
Which paths have you walked?  
Where have you lost everything?  
What have you gained, who knows?  
Where have you lost everything?  
What have you gained, who knows?

**Verse 2**  
Thought of himself as alive, but he’s asleep,  
He’ll open his eyes the day death comes for him.  
How can I call myself a sinner in the name of saints?  
How to act, when thoughts are empty?  
Yeah.  
I want to be like my father,  
But it feels like I’m becoming my love for money.  
It gives peace, then makes me restless, money.  
Maybe the music earned what’s forbidden.  
Yeah.  
I want to be like my father,  
But it seems this desire will remain unfulfilled.  
How many questions do I carry about myself?  
When will I fulfill my family’s wishes?  
The world keeps spinning,  
How do I look down?  
How do I stay humble in a world that pulls me down?  
If I don’t trust myself, how can I trust others?  
They say they’ve got my back,  
But now I see behind me.  
I’m sad, my Lord, give me strength,  
Give me a little concern to better myself.  
May your blessings not ruin me,  
I’m not worthy, just mention me.

Yeah.  
The arrival keeps coming, and this pen keeps writing,  
The black buyer becomes the selling artist.  
My vessel is broken, yet I carry it,  
The cup fills, but the glass keeps falling.  
Good hopes prepare for bad outcomes,  
Learning humanity, then talking about Islam.  
I want my heart to speak what my tongue says,  
But my answers become questions.

**Pre-Chorus**  
Hashim, bow your head,  
You know, whether you know or not,  
What do you gain from prostration?  
God will take revenge, calling you.  
Yeah.  
Humans don’t understand,  
Searching for morning in the nights,  
Stay awake at night,  
Who knows when the Almighty will reconcile?

**Chorus**  
You don’t know (don’t know)  
What’s in your heart?  
Where are you? (Where are you?)
