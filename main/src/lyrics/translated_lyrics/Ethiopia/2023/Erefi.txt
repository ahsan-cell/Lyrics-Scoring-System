**Translated Lyrics:**

It has captivated me, yes, yes  
It has captivated me, yes  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  

When you come close, you know my weak side  
Is it not true that you test me with your distance?  
You’ve left me like I’m unguarded, not protected  
I can’t even call out to you, my heart is heavy  
I love you, but it’s not just a game, I’m sincere  
Living without you doesn’t feel right, I’m lost  
It’s clear, I’m not one to play around, I don’t want to stray  
One thing is for sure, I won’t lower myself for anyone else  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  

I won’t say what I don’t know, even if it hurts  
Sometimes, advice doesn’t fade away  
Until my name is called out from your lips  
Will it be a blessing or a curse, who knows?  
If you want to embrace me, then hold me tight  
If your love doesn’t reach me, let it go, I’ll move on  
Beauty doesn’t fade, it remains in its place  
My father and mother are women, don’t belittle me, please  

**Chorus:**  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  

It has captivated me, yes,  
It has captivated me, indeed  
It has captivated me,  
It has captivated me so much  
It has captivated me, oh yes  
It has captivated me,  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love  
Oh, my love, oh, my love, oh, my love
