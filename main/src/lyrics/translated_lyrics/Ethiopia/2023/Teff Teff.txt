**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part 1: Fatoni]**  
You slide into my DMs with a portrait of Henry the Eighth (Okay)  
You and your friend think he looks like me, and you both had to laugh so hard (Okay)  
You send me another portrait of Modest Petrovich Mussorgsky (Okay)  
You say he looks like me too, just older, worn out, and pretty drunk (Thanks)  
"Don't know, could be"  
You send a picture of a tour bus  
That has my name and ask: "Second leg?"  
Hehe, great punchline  
A little later, you write that you saw I saw it (Okay)  
And that in your opinion, not responding is quite arrogant  
Next message, someone asks me why I don’t play "Prejudices" anymore  
In their opinion, it’s still the best song I ever wrote (Okay)  
Otherwise, they have to honestly say they don’t hear much from me (Okay)  
Also, they can understand why Edgar doesn’t work with me anymore, 'cause he’s still real (Okay)  
I’m sitting on the train (Choo, choo)  
And put my phone away (Away)  
'Cause someone’s talking to me (Hi, hi)  
She says it’s not right (No, no)  
That I call people "spast" in my songs, I say: "True, I’ve stopped that"  
She says the old songs are still available, that bothered her too  
Unfortunately, I have to get off (Off), I just step out (Out)  
I listen to Wu-Tang Clan on my phone and walk three stops home (Uah)  

**[Pre-Hook: Fatoni, Edgar Wasser]**  
Alright  
This song isn’t really your style  
Alright (Yeah)  
You think the beat isn’t that great  
Alright (Uh, ha)  
And you didn’t quite like the lyrics either  
Alright (Alright)  
Alright (Mhm)  
Alright (Okay)  
Alright

**[Part 2: Edgar Wasser]**  
Oh my God, oh my God  
I’m so overwhelmed right now, I’m at a loss for words (Uh)  
Thanks to everyone who voted for me and always supports me (Really)  
So, that I’m getting the award (Huh), I never thought that (Never)  
Coincidentally, I also wrote a speech (Heh)  
My first thanks goes to Jesus (Jesus)  
You guide me through your commandments (Huh)  
Without them, I wouldn’t know that rape is not an option (Ah-ah)  
Also, thanks to my family and my friends (Yeah)  
That you never question the made-up reasons when I borrow money for drugs (You trust me)  
Shoutouts also go to the attentive waiter (Yeah)  
Who speaks English with me even though I ordered in German (Senk you)  
And while we’re on the subject, I also thank retirees  
Who compliment me for having almost no accent (Almost perfect)  
Furthermore, I’d like to greet the friendly flight attendant (Hi)  
Who reminds me before the flight that where I sit is the emergency exit (Ni)  
Should the plane crash, she counts on my cooperation (Oh)  
Actually, that’s too much responsibility for me, but the legroom is cool  
I mean, what should I do, I say
