**[Intro]**  
Yeah, yeah  
Right, right, yeah  

**[Verse 1]**  
Yo, yo, screw your mother and spit on it  
Rewriting history serves to hide the bloodstains  
I want to make this money for my family, for my little self  
If you have a little kitty, introduce it to my little face  
All these bastards want to touch my share but lack the resources  
If it's empty in your head, if it's empty down there, call me quick, I'll fill you up  
All my words are meant to be pondered  
The truth, you want me to share the cash, screw you, I only share ideas  
To make some dough, I've been here, I've been there, huh  
I sleep in palaces, my dick and your ass are inseparable, huh  
I fly first class, stealing on the fly, shoplifting  
The brothers need to weigh like Ashkenazis or Sephardim  
I hit it and run, take a shot or two, I gotta get rid of it  
I’ll send you to the Lord if I open my envelope and there’s not enough  
All my brothers are straight, lured by the parallel economy  
We steal because the word "cash" and the word "free" both start with an L  

**[Chorus]**  
The sirens, the system, don’t like my skin  
The sirens, the system, don’t like my skin  
So we move on without the laws, we shit on them  
We move on without the laws, we shit on them  
In the ankles, brother  
In the ankles, brother  
In the heads of the brothers  
In the heads of the brothers  
France came to do its shopping, put us in a bind  
You wanted to start rap, you got yourself in a bind  
You’re a brother who does the deals, you got yourself in a bind  
Everything's fine, as long as my salary shits on your salary  

**[Verse 2]**  
Soon I’ll be on the cover of Amina, on the schneck with Trina  
I show up like Katrina, rain on the Latinas  
Bitch, I bring out your animal side  
I wipe off your makeup through your tear ducts  
You’re talking about me on YouTube, a jinn visits you  
Swallow white spirit, swallow my centiliters  
If you’re 35 and suffering, shut up at my signal  
I’m too strong because in my head there’s a boy talking  
My father wore clogs, my mother cleaned old folks  
She raised me alone, the good Lord saw it with his own eyes  
Talk about her and we’ll show up at your place disguised  
Back like McFly, back like the bailiffs  

**[Chorus]**  
The sirens, the system, don’t like my skin  
The sirens, the system, don’t like my skin  
So we move on without the laws, we shit on them  
We move on without the laws, we shit on them  
In the ankles, brother  
In the ankles, brother  
In the heads of the brothers  
In the heads of the brothers  
France came to do its shopping, put us in a bind  
You wanted to start rap, you got yourself in a bind  
You’re a brother who does the deals, you got yourself in a bind  
Everything's fine, as long as my salary shits on your salary
