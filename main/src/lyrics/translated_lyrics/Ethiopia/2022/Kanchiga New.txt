Until Lavie!

She hits me with a mango (Juju)  
Yeah, a mango (Juju)  
She hits me with a mango (Juju)  
Ah! a mango (Juju)  

She hits me with a mango (Juju)  
Yeah, a mango (Juju)  
She hits me with a mango (Juju)  
Ah! a mango (Juju)  

When she looks at me (Juju)  
I buy her a beer (Juju)  
When she teases me (Juju)  
I throw her cash (Juju)  

She casts a spell on me quickly (Juju)  
Here I’m thinking of a guesthouse (Juju)  
I’m drinking by the sea (Juju)  
While she’s sipping Hennessy (Juju)  

If she cheats, let her cheat  
Because for me, I’m fit, I say I won’t let go  
Let them do it on the chairs  
Or up in the trees, I won’t shake  
I say I won’t let go!

She hits me with a mango (Juju)  
Say I’m dead from the vibe  
She hits me with a mango (Juju)  
When she comes to the ghetto, I give her warmth

Mango, when you board the plane, fly high (Juju)  
I’ll walk on foot (Juju)  
Ride a brand new Range (Juju)  
I’ll climb up like a king (Juju)  

Even if I catch you in the ghetto with a guy  
I don’t like sulking  
You’ve hit me with a vibe that’s overwhelming  
A love affair  

They say I saw her with a flirt (Enhe)  
She’s dancing in a puddle (Enhe)  
She’s taking your coins  
Let me be (A love affair)  

Element, life spills out blessings (Enhe)  
Tipsy, she has many suitors (Enhe)  
Forty-forty rooms, I’m feeling the chance  
Let me be (A love affair)  

If she cheats, let her cheat  
Because for me, I’m fit, I say I won’t let go  
Let them do it on the chairs  
Or up in the trees, I won’t shake  
I say I won’t let go!
