**Translated Lyrics:**

**Chevrotine! (paw, paw, paw)**  
All my tough guys reload the chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
All my rednecks, my white trash have chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
My crew can unleash a barrage of chevrotines (paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
All my tough guys reload the chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
All my rednecks, my white trash have chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
My crew can unleash a barrage of chevrotines (paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  

**[Verse 1: 25G]**  
The little one briefs him? Tell him to avoid Ry-Fleu, he fights back, slap him, a low kick, mess him up  
In the suburbs, there's little happiness, hustling early in the morning  
The little ones are pricey like Tom Sawyer, selling death in bags  
From Delor, from Versace, your plan B didn’t work, the cops tell you “What’s up?” first thing in the morning  
There’s Voriz, Billy Joe, and 25G, nice to meet you, the trio of crazies, we smash heads on a construction site  
Our bling-bling is dentures, chevrotine, masked and well-gloved  
In the hall, it’s freezing, gotta pull out the tear gas, no noise bothers me  
25G is wild like an aborigine, we fight in the mud, yes I love it  
You’re a depraved girl like Sue Ellen, show your breasts like the Femen  
Bullets don’t stop for anyone except Luke Cage, don’t act tough, you annoy me with your "what's up"  
Shut your mouth, don’t play around, at the spot, shh, never spill the beans  

**[Chorus: Jason Voriz]**  
Chevrotine! (paw, paw, paw)  
All my tough guys reload the chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
All my rednecks, my white trash have chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
My crew can unleash a barrage of chevrotines (paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
All my tough guys reload the chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
All my rednecks, my white trash have chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
My crew can unleash a barrage of chevrotines (paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  

**[Verse 2: Jason Voriz]**  
Straw hat, plaid flannel shirt, my crew is very stylish  
Barn filled with chainsaws and guns, I’m in my element  
You want to risk facing Jason Voriz, it’ll be at your expense  
I feel like Pascal Olmeta, I could shoot an elephant  
Hunting caliber, please put away your little piece  
Hunting caliber, a liter of crap flows from your ass  
Generation 80 like Carlos and Cabrel  
Dude, I’ll strip your ride whether it’s a Merc or a 4L  
In every brothel, I know the big boss or the madam  
Shirt open, my belly’s as big as Rick Ross and Fat Ray  
Dude, get down before you get taken down, I piss on your still glowing ashes  
The 0.6, blurh, it snows white not just in December  
It’s a terrible drama when I pull out the gun, if I have serious psychological issues, ask Freud  
Chevrotines and big knives, Jason Voriz, big guy  
Roasted goat, pan bagnat, I have a pure country style  

**[Chorus: Jason Voriz]**  
Chevrotine! (paw, paw, paw)  
All my tough guys reload the chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
All my rednecks, my white trash have chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
My crew can unleash a barrage of chevrotines (paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
All my tough guys reload the chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
All my rednecks, my white trash have chevrotines (paw, paw, paw)  
My crew can unleash a barrage of chevrotines (paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)  
Chevrotine (paw, paw)
