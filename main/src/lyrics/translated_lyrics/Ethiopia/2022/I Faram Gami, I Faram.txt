**[Intro]**  
Yo  
The industry evolves as fast as you scroll on Insta, my brother  
I represent the new generation  
I appeared because you called me  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
That's why we're storming in now  

**[Chorus]**  
The alarm has sounded and I've prepared the ammunition, assault!  
#don’tbeafool! The motto: "divide et impera," assault!  
Tell me, Caesar, the tank has arrived, five stars, like in GTA  
Authority, ready to leave my mark, I’ve capped it off, it’s shutdown, like Skepta!  
The alarm has sounded and I've prepared the ammunition, assault!  
#don’tbeafool! The motto: "divide et impera," assault!  
Tell me, Caesar, the tank has arrived, five stars, like in GTA  
Authority, ready to leave my mark, I’ve capped it off, it’s shutdown, like Skepta!  

**[Verse]**  
The show begins when everyone alarms that nothing's been released for a while  
“Pretentious” and “snobbish,” has other goals than to drop tracks by the minute  
Every time I show up, everyone wonders: “Where did he come from and when?”  
Because I diverge from all the idols, an antagonist like Belzebut  
I say hello!  
If you don’t know me, I’m Cojo, nice to meet you  
If you listen to me, I try to educate you  
If you do rap and think anything that’s not boom bap is trap, please, mute yourself  
If you’ve heard of grime, I respect you!  
I represent the new wave, the new dialect  
So put aside everything you’ve done until now and hit REC  
Dad told me: "Son, be careful who you diss"  
Because this world is based on compromise  
And making drugs takes effort, and until now I haven’t touched them  
Mom told me: "Always make little bubbles  
Be as I know you, always full of jokes  
Let music evolve" and that’s why I decided then  
Back to genesis, it should be the time  
Pull up the game and make room for grime  
Believe me, I’m Ultimate just like Denzel Curry  
Trust me, I am the one  
Your heart beats endogenously, simultaneously with the first step on stage  
The audience waits, full of adrenaline, to see what you’ve got  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
That's why we're storming in now  

**[Chorus]**  
The alarm has sounded and I've prepared the ammunition, assault!  
#don’tbeafool! The motto: "divide et impera," assault!  
Tell me, Caesar, the tank has arrived, five stars, like in GTA  
Authority, ready to leave my mark, I’ve capped it off, it’s shutdown, like Skepta!  
The alarm has sounded and I've prepared the ammunition, assault!  
#don’tbeafool! The motto: "divide et impera," assault!  
Tell me, Caesar, the tank has arrived, five stars, like in GTA  
Authority, ready to leave my mark, I’ve capped it off, it’s shutdown, like Skepta!  

**[Outro]**  
Yo  

**[Part II: Andante]**  

**[Intro]**  
Thank you very much, Deli, for the invitation! Peace Urbanist, peace Vlad Flueraru, peace to my brothers from UNATC, hahaha. Had to say that too  
Yo  
Get the fuck outta here  

**[Verse]**  
Andante, on calmants  
Naturally thrilling from antioxidants  
Striking sounds, extravagant  
Dichotomous: infernal and divinely comic like Dante  
You’re kind of pulling back, terrifying cracks  
Because Cojo on tracks is said to be on stimulants  
Be a forerunner, but without fear  
With new styles, earthquakes  
A premonitory siege, because we’re storming in  
Like a tank, flame like at a literary club  
Epur simove - Descartes? No!  
Dubito ergo cogito, cogito ergo summarized  
With cabotinous ardor full of flair  
The girls with curves think they’re Plato’s muses  
They break everything, but fine, the boss, don’t corrode me  
I radiate new beginnings with Uvedenrode rays  
I’m full of words like Philistines are of Goethe  
Predominantly, I only encounter anecdotal schizophrenics  
Because if he only knows beats and likes to listen to Mezzo  
And if before hearing about Biggie he knew about Guido d'Arezzo  
He can’t do rap because the punks won’t let him, because he’s supposedly precious  
So there
