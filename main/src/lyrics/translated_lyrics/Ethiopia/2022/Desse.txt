**Translated Lyrics:**

925 chains around my neck  
Silver on my wrists, right and left  
I talk about tennis in the studio, the paddles  
Shining at my feet, these Air Max 97  

925 chains around my neck  
Silver on my wrists, right and left  
I talk about tennis in the studio, the paddles  
Shining at my feet, these Air Max 97  

[Verse]  
925 chains around my neck  
Too much ice TNF, what do you know?  
McDonald's, kebab, or pizza  
From the tobacco shop, Rothmans  
You think you're a rapper  
But you're just a wannabe  
I'm tired of all these fakes in the scene  
Like Mahmood and Blanco  
I can't stand them even when they speak  
I've made everything clear with Gucci Serpents  
People know you're like those slimy snakes  
Even with little cash, I've always kept my style high  
Always shining like metal  
Dressed like that, you don't belong here  
Those high-waisted elephant pants aren't hip-hop  
I talk about tennis in the studio, the paddles  
Not about chains with VVS from Zalando for 30 euros  
Before, you didn't have a Jordan, you were wearing 80-euro Nikes  
You'd break an arm for me, raise 1000 euros  
I don't forget the past  
It's all nice as long as it goes well  
But then you find out you're the only one who believes it  
Silver, the eternal second  
Number 1, maybe another day  

**[Chorus]**  
925 chains around my neck  
Silver on my wrists, right and left  
I talk about tennis in the studio, the paddles  
Shining at my feet, these Air Max 97  
925 chains around my neck  
Silver on my wrists, right and left  
I talk about tennis in the studio, the paddles  
Shining at my feet, these Air Max 97
