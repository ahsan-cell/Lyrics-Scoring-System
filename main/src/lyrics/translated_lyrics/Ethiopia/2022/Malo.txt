**Translated Lyrics:**

Though it seems to have been difficult, years in crisis  
Changing my way of being, searching for roots  
Getting to know my true self, listening to its voice  
I learned to respect myself, I learned to connect with God  
Life is very simple, simpler than you imagine  
I let myself go and feel alive again  
After contemplating the truth, you won't be able to stop seeking it  
It's the source of eternal life, so I chose to live to find it  

Then everything began to shine, with Jah's light  
On a new path  
Then my soul started to heal, to awaken  
For I have already ignited the fire  

Don't think, don't hesitate, time is nothing  
Silence your ego (Sh!) for your soul speaks to you  
Trust in Jah, for you are part of the earth  
Return to the center and leave the bad outside  
Though it could have been easier, I flowed as I wished  
And I always stood tall, painting gray days  
Getting to know myself through you, listening to me  
I learned to seek ways, to search and know how to choose  
And no one is greater than anyone, and I am a nobody  
Playing in the air, floating in the air  
Always observing from the same place  
I learned to fly high, and today I hope to learn how to come down.
