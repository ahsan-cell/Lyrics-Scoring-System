**Translated Lyrics:**

Where they speak loudly, where they smoke  
Where they break down and rebuild the world  
Where they tailor a few suits  
There are the intoxicated evenings  
In the end, we no longer know well  
What we were defending at the start  
Would there be a little wine left?  

There are the long discussions  
When we end up a bit tipsy  
Calling each other all sorts of names  
Sellout, rotten, illiterate  
There are all the love vows  
The passionate declarations  
I love you, I will always love you  
The rhyme is poor, I admit  

{Chorus:}  
But to be silent, to be silent with a friend  
To be silent, to say nothing, not to chat  
Outside, outside, it’s raining but sheltered  
Finding refuge in silence  

There are the activist evenings  
Where we must vote on motions  
There are the evenings when we sing  
Moustaki, Brassens, and Souchon  
The endless chatter  
The disputes, the controversies  
The never-ending quarrels  
Session at the café of commerce  

There are the talks, the gossip  
The slanders, the chitchat  
The "they say," the "by the way"  
The tall tales, the small talk  
Sometimes late into the night  
The ceremony of confessions  
We share a few secrets  
Confidences eye to eye  

But to be silent, to be silent with a friend  
Oh! To be silent, to be quiet together  
Outside, outside, we no longer hear the rain  
It’s nice to be a little bored  

And when the sun appears  
Suddenly, look, one marvels  
It was just a summer rain  
Look a bit, a rainbow  
Back and forth, an hour later  
The other responds in a formal tone  
Ah yes, it’s true, I recognize  
That rainbow was beautiful  

{x2:}  
Ah! To be silent, to be silent with a friend  
Oh! To be silent, to avoid comments  
It can last, last a whole lifetime  
Summer takes its winter quarters
