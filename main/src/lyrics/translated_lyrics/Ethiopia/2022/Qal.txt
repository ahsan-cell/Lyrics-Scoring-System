**Translated Lyrics:**

I write with thirst,  
A chronicler by candlelight,  
In my isolation,  
The pen stains the page.

Gifted by God,  
I carry a halo,  
Like a saint for putting so much  
Into this simple writing.

Where I plant visions  
That nourish the pilgrimage,  
Like those apparitions  
Of the Virgin at Cova d'Iria*.

I gather the common folk and strangers  
Who listen with sincerity,  
Who hasn’t wanted to be a shepherd  
Or a keeper of flocks?

I don’t bring metaphysics to this lesson,  
Let’s return to the tobacco shop.  
I am Esteves,  
Not Saint Stephen.

Like therapy,  
A word soup of watercress,  
I never wanted the basin,  
Nor the cup of competition.

Inverted from King John I,  
I abdicate the throne.  
Secondly, I want the neckline  
Of the nymphs from Canto IX.

Thirdly, I flee at a gallop,  
Riding a rocinante,  
Like Don Quixote galloping  
Towards the horizon.

(HORIZON)

On the horizon,  
I flee from rotten flows, I’m on the rise,  
Rare and heavy, boy, like a rhinoceros,  
Dark flows hit, Shaka Zulu,  
Solitary, soon I’ll close up in a cocoon.

You don’t jump, my boy, you only fall flat,  
Red tie, any rhyme he brings, I cut through,  
I’m an eel, good boy, if he wants a shock,  
And if he lies, it’s elementary, I’m Sherlock.  
I’m an Infante, an important Portuguese navigator,  
You’re a parasite that rap avoids, a bloodsucker.  
Sweet flow, but it decays, boy, I’m tooth decay,  
Rhymes that put you on your back, osotogari**.

I never tried to make a life out of this,  
But right from the first attempt, I left you wounded.  
Easy like getting back on a bike, on the mic my rap is Queen,  
Hard work, but it heals. Betadine.

*Note: Cova d'Iria refers to the site of the Marian apparitions in Fatima, Portugal.
