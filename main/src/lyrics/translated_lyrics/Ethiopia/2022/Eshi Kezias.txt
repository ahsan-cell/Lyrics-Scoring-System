**Translated Lyrics:**

The king of narcotics, Hugo Lasis, had divided Riga into several distribution zones  
When it was going well, one could really make good money  
About 3000 lats  

**[Chorus by Salvadors daLean]**  
Hugo Boss [Hugo Boss]  
Hugo Lasis [Hugo Lasis]  
Hugo Sniegs [Hugo Sniegs]  
What does Hugo bring? [Hugo!]  
Hey Hugo, how are you doing?  
Tell me, Hugo, can we have one?  
Little Sand and Wall Street  
Hugo is the miller of Riga  

**[Salvadors daLean]**  
Hugo is in demand and hustles like a gigolo  
So all the ladies obey him like a dog trainer  
Hugo's heart belongs to a girl from the synagogue  
Hugo had a wedding – Hugo Figaro  
While America suffers from the Great Depression  
Hugo's hustling devil's flour, tossing quesadillas  
Hugo's pockets are heavy with lats  
Hugo sends snitches down the needle path to the graves  
And when the snow goes sledding down the slopes  
Butts on the floor do splits wherever they land  
Hugo, how are you doing? (Well, slowly. A couple of packs a month, but it adds up for bread)  
In the Esplanade, a flock of sheep, Hugo's a fierce wolf  
Short joys, but I want the pleasure to last long  
A light blue suit, such a fresh style  
Lasis swims in the duck pond like a shark  

**[Chorus by Salvadors daLean]**  
Hugo Boss [Hugo Boss]  
Hugo Lasis [Hugo Lasis]  
Hugo Sniegs [Hugo Sniegs]  
What does Hugo bring? [Hugo!]  
Hey Hugo, how are you doing?  
Tell me, Hugo, can we have one?  
Little Sand and Wall Street  
Hugo is the miller of Riga  

**[Tambura Pesto]**  
Need to improve your mood? Better not ask for a doctor  
Meet Hugo, you’ll feel better than a salmon after spawning  
Come to the square, wink, Lasis understood you want a gram  
Hugo knew how to throw even without WhatsApp or Telegram  
Hugo was the MVP and he always will be  
Because he drew like Purvītis and Padegs never could  
Otto Schwarz, hot ladies, then off to the hotel  
Hugo always has a stack of silver five-lats  
Čakste took it, Zemgals took it, the Laivinieki brothers took it  
Hugo's buddies sit in Benjamiņu's house like hosts  
Kārlis once got high and felt like a dictator  
After the coup, he said: “Hugo, you’re really cool!”  

**[Chorus by Salvadors daLean]**  
Hugo Boss [Hugo Boss]  
Hugo Lasis [Hugo Lasis]  
Hugo Sniegs [Hugo Sniegs]  
What does Hugo bring? [Hugo!]  
Hey Hugo, how are you doing?  
Tell me, Hugo, can we have one?  
Little Sand and Wall Street  
Hugo is the miller of Riga  

**[The Big Lunch]**  
Devil's flour falls, the mill turns (voššš)  
Suit on from a good fashion brand (Boss)  
At the bar by the exchange, glasses clink (toast)  
The whole crew drinks while the pain eases (boss)  
Envious ones, snitches – damn those nuisances  
Hugo works, Hugo builds the economy  
But sometimes Hugo has to pull the strings  
On those politicians who like to sniff that snow  
It’s work, not a hobby, it needs a lobby  
Doing this, you can’t stay dry, like a camel in the Gobi  
The crutches ask where the money comes from?  
Hugo tells them tales like Skalbju Kārlis  

**[Chorus by Salvadors daLean]**  
Hugo Boss [Hugo Boss]  
Hugo Lasis [Hugo Lasis]  
Hugo Sniegs [Hugo Sniegs]  
What does Hugo bring? [Hugo!]  
Hey Hugo, how are you doing?  
Tell me, Hugo, can we have one?  
Little Sand and Wall Street  
Hugo is the miller of Riga
