**Translated Lyrics:**

Drunken miners didn’t know what to do  
Where to go?! What to do?!  
To the HR department, it’s clear  
But miners only make one mistake...  
And Bora?  
In the HR office, silence, stillness...  
Then Bora cries out and shouts:  
Oh, mother!  
And his scream overpowers the sound of the mines  
But miners only make one mistake...  
And Bora... And Bora?  
He quickly grew into a handsome boy  
Into a handsome boy, almost a young man  
Then he spat and said: I’m knocking, master!  
I’m knocking, you won’t cry, I’m hitting, you won’t manage!  
But miners only make one mistake...  
And Bora?  
Bora inhaled the smoke of Bor  
And Bora will become a miner  
To shake things up, to rock the boat...  
But miners only make one mistake...  
From the smelter, they poured out the slag...  
Directly into the pit... on the helmets of tired miners  
Flotation... living mud!  
But miners only make one mistake...  
And Bora?  
In Bora’s head, a short circuit happened  
A young engineer walks along the serpentine  
And Bora roars, and Bora roars:  
Workers of the world, unite!  
Amen... miners only make one mistake...  
Bora bought Pino Silvestre  
But money doesn’t buy love  
And miners only make one mistake...  
They make mistakes! Do they?  
Oooooooooooo, snakes, reptiles, vermin, vermin...  
And when a mine explodes, it smells like pine forest  
But miners only make one mistake...  
Bora brings down the whole serpentine  
With just the press of a button  
The rock cracks, the pickaxe breaks  
But miners only make one mistake...  
And Bora?  
Pino Silvestre starts to blow  
A cold wind blows along the serpentine  
In his head, it buzzes:  
Miners only make one mistake!  
In an instant, Dart runs him over...  
And that’s the big truck  
No one will ever love it like I loved you and you  
The engineer walks along the serpentine  
And on the seventh, Bora Miner sleeps  
The engineer walks along the serpentine  
And on the seventh, Bora Miner sleeps  
Because miners only make one mistake...
