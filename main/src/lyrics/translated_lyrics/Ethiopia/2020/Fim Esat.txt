**Translated Lyrics:**

**The vision, NGP**  
**3-4-Z is in the house**  
**It's the P on this damn beat**  

**[Verse 1: PDV]**  
Nasty, PDV is the rallying call for the handling  
3-4 the department in the scheming  
South of France, both green and white  
Solo on the slope, I broke my teeth  
Early in the grind, we all want a German engine  
I’m fully in it, no gloves on, in my element, not too elegant, I’m aware of it all  
Bad news, I can’t sleep, tired of counting my cash  
I have the mindset of Yuri Boyka, I work alone, don’t need your advice  
[400 like Goro?], living like Zorro, if we rise, it’s for the euros  
Red like a bull, I wear the coro, I represent 3-4-0  

**[Pre-Chorus: Nasty]**  
With the N and the P in the lab, coming down from the sky like a bird of prey  
I’m just grinding for the stash, weight on my shoulders like the stress of class  
Gotta own up to my faults like a boss, all these bad choices that bind me  
Only warriors in my circle, I bring my team...  

**[Chorus]**  
What did we say? That nothing was impossible  
I’m in my stories, hidden like a fossil  
What did we say? That nothing was impossible  
I’m in my stories, hidden like a fossil  

**[Verse 2: Nasty]**  
We lack no ambition in my squad  
We’re ready to do whatever it takes to get by  
I want the German gamos and the weed from Spain  
I’m lost in thought, head on the pillow  
I tell myself fuck this shit and smoke a bush  
The more I burn, the more powerful I become  
Eyes bloodshot under the visor  
We don’t play with those who pass under the jacket  
[?] in the bladder, everything that goes down the toilet  
I’m precise when I invest, only hits in the BC  
Thanks PDV, only bombs like Gaza  
The nine or the mic [?] don dada  
The [?] puts the beats in i  
Flames in my eyes, my demons are gathering  

**[Pre-Chorus: Nasty]**  
With the N and the P in the lab, coming down from the sky like a bird of prey  
I’m just grinding for the stash, weight on my shoulders like the stress of class  
Gotta own up to my faults like a boss, all these bad choices that bind me  
Only warriors in my circle, I bring my team...  

**[Chorus]**  
What did we say? That nothing was impossible  
I’m in my stories, hidden like a fossil  
What did we say? That nothing was impossible  
I’m in my stories, hidden like a fossil  
What did we say? That nothing was impossible  
I’m in my stories, hidden like a fossil  
What did we say? That nothing was impossible  
I’m in my stories, hidden like a fossil
