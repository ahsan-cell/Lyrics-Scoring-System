**Translated Lyrics:**

**About Motherland**  
She is my mother, my pride,  
Oh, how I love my country.  

I will not be silent,  
About my motherland,  
She is my pride,  
Oh, how I love my country.  

How many have died for your honor?  
They did not flee when they saw your waters.  
In the land of the brave, where the feet stand firm,  
When her name is called, it echoes through the air.  
Even if the sky does not see your flag,  
When your name is called, who can remain silent?  
Even if the sky does not see your flag,  
When Ethiopia is mentioned, who can remain silent?  

Oh-oh-oh, ha-ha...  

With the strength of your spirit, you raise your flag high,  
Your emblem shines bright, even in the darkest night.  
Mother of the mountains, your home stands proud,  
The head of the brave, a fortress that speaks loud.  
In the realm of nature, your honor reigns supreme,  
Ethiopia, the beginning of every dream.  

You might also like:  
In the sky, if it shows color,  
It’s hers alone, nothing else compares.  
The coming era is led by her,  
Today, if the world speaks, she remains at the forefront.  
Let them go, they will leave me behind,  
Ethiopia means everything to me, it’s my lifeline.  
If the injera is served with a side of stew,  
Mother will change, or will she stay true?  
I won’t forget, my hand raised high,  
Mother is here, hope never runs dry.  
Her legacy, I carry without fail,  
When Ethiopia is mentioned, together we prevail.  

Ethiopia (Ethiopia)  
My homeland (my homeland)  
Ethiopia (Ethiopia)  
My homeland (my homeland)  
You are not just a name, but my pride.  

I will not be silent,  
About my motherland,  
She is my pride,  
Oh, how I love my country.  
How many have died for your honor?  
They did not flee when they saw your waters.  
In the land of the brave...
