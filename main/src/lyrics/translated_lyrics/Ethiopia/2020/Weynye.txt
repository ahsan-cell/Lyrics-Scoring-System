**Translated Lyrics:**

Nikitaman Mhm  
Nikitaman, give it to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Give it to me, yeah  
Give it to me, oh  
Give it to me, bit  
Give it to me, bam bam  
Bam bam bam  
Give it to me  
So here I invite you all  
When you’re partying  
When Niki laughs  
Give it to me, that’s our night  
Give it, give it, give it, give it, bam  
If you want it too  
Turn up the bass  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
Like right-wing ideologies  
Do you really think we’ll lose  
The courage or the desire  
To demonstrate against you losers?  
I wonder what’s going on in Europe  
Mhm  
The right is gaining traction, it’s getting big  
Mhm  
The Berlusconis, Le Pens, Haiders, and Cos  
Mhm  
And Schill and Stoiber give us the push  
Mhm  
We should all just relax  
Chill out! Chill out!  
Start resistance relaxed  
Chill out! Chill out!  
We’re waking up and you’ll be scared  
Chill out! Chill out!  
In Hamburg City, we’re starting  
Chill out! Chill out!  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
Like right-wing ideologies  
Do you really think we’ll lose  
The courage or the desire  
To demonstrate against you losers?  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
For example, Mr. Schily  
Definitely not a genius  
If he thinks with fingerprints Germany will be safer than ever  
If you ask me, I don’t feel safe in Germany  
Mhm  
It’s really a lousy country for skaters and stoners  
Mhm  
For writers, S-Bahn surfers, dog owners  
Mhm  
If you have some fun, you’ll go straight to the judge  
Mhm  
Who even believes in an Ottokatalog?  
Idiots  
Our freedom would surely be dead soon  
Idiots  
If it were up to you, everyone would have a barcode  
Idiots  
I think a true statement is needed  
Idiots  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
For example, Mr. Schily  
Definitely not a genius  
If he thinks with fingerprints Germany will be safer than ever  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
Just like the charts you play  
On one hand, it’s weak  
And on the other, there are only lyrics that no one cares about  
The music scene here is truly pathetic  
Mhm  
You only get into the charts if you’re blonde and dumb  
Mhm  
Or you get bought like now by Bro'Sis - Oh shame on you  
Mhm  
It’s so embarrassing, I thought it couldn’t exist  
Mhm  
Scooters and Kellys are inexplicable to me  
Mhm  
Why are idiots glorified?  
Mhm  
Using your brain is dangerous  
Mhm  
Because suddenly you realize: No one is honest!  
Mhm  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
Just like the charts you play  
On one hand, it’s weak  
And on the other, there are only lyrics that no one cares about  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
Just like crappy weed  
Or a spliff that doesn’t hit  
Or you’re smoking a joint and have a hole in your sieve  
If you ask me, the song is now finished  
Mhm  
With the hook line and the sample, it’s almost dangerous  
Mhm  
With a sing-along effect, I hear nothing, be honest  
Mhm  
With so many themes, none of them are dispensable  
Mhm  
We should all just relax  
Chill out! Chill out!  
Start resistance relaxed  
Chill out! Chill out!  
We’re waking up and you’ll be scared  
Chill out! Chill out!  
In Hamburg City, we’re starting  
Chill out! Chill out!  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
Like right-wing ideologies  
Do you really think we’ll lose  
The courage or the desire  
To demonstrate against you losers?  
This is just a song  
On a simple beat  
My simple answer  
To the nonsense that exists  
For example, Mr. Schily  
Definitely not a genius
