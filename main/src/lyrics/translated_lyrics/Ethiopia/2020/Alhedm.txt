**Translated Lyrics:**

**I. The Storytelling**
Speaking of the day, the day has already brightened  
I'm going to sleep, I won't work, please clock in for me  
And if the boss asks, just say anything  
Tell him I broke my collarbone yesterday playing ball - in "Good Morning"  
Everything starts in the first track, a true greeting. The chorus establishes the continuous cycle of life that the character is part of and serves as his inspiration. The track feels like a dialogue between the character, "Pombo," and a colleague at work. We notice that the character has various traits and attitudes that many listeners will surely identify with, such as the highlighted excerpt showcasing the "Brazilian way" of skipping work. Thus, right from the start, we realize that we will follow this character throughout the album, an idea made even more evident with the use of interludes that show his dialogue with his conscience.

This element of storytelling, while being the core of the album, isn't so explicit in the sense that the tracks maintain their individual characteristics. The perspective from which these stories are told also shifts at various moments. In "Ubuntu," for example, the first verse is narrated as if the character is listening to the guide of the terreiro (a place of worship in Afro-Brazilian religions), while in the second, we hear the character's conscience reflecting on what happened.

**II. "Occupy and Resist"**
They told us to give up, but we chose to resist  
Because the act of existing, for us, is the act of creating  
With space and the rest as our raw material  
And our form of protest is our way of loving - in "Nonconformist"  
Art itself is seen as a form of resistance. Many rap albums and tracks present this idea, which has become increasingly strong in light of current discussions about black, female, and sexual representation. Thiago brings this element into various moments in the album, such as in the track "Nonconformist." The highlighted excerpt well describes this characteristic of his compositions.

This also appears in the features. Flávio SantoRua discusses consumerism and how it affects the poor in "The City and the Movement." The track "Who is the Enemy?" features Tamara Franklin and Rincon Sapiência, who, along with Elniño, justify their art and the resistance of black individuals in their lyrics. Douglas Din in "What's Your Price?" speaks from the perspective of drug users and the reasons for their existence. Thus, at this moment in the album, we are presented with the justifications for resistance and the inspirations behind many of these artists' rap songs—the very essence that built the culture—along with the necessity of not silencing these voices and issues.

**III. Messages in a Reflective Poetic Tone**
Their son was never a thug, no  
But man, the issue was to maintain my honor  
Now it's darkness and shadow, because today I  
Understood that only those who have died can kill  
Understood that only those who have died can kill  
Understood that only those who have died can kill - in "The City in Motion"  
Much is said about rap needing to convey a message. We also cannot ignore the much-discussed "Lyrical Year." I can't overlook these two fervent discussions in the national scene while listening to this album. Thiago Elniño gives a true lesson regarding these two aspects. In the highlighted excerpt from "The City in Motion," without resorting to overly technical aspects, references, or multisyllabic rhymes, the carioca MC delivers a profound message in light of a situation so common to young black individuals in the favelas across Brazil, where ironically, the term we use to refer to this place houses individuals truly broken by the system. 

This doesn't happen only in this track; the entire album is composed of striking and deep phrases. The poetic tone is quite melancholic, after all, the character himself lives this reality. The very track that closes the album, titled "In the End," brings the solution to many of these reflections: love, but not just love in the conventional sense, but love for one another.

**IV. "Pedagoginga," the Album Track**
They told me that black people have no place  
And what did Hip-Hop do? It came and told me the opposite  
School always reinforced that I was ugly  
Hip-Hop came and said: "You're beautiful as hell"  
Hip-Hop taught me about autonomy  
Autonomy that school never gave me  
School taught me to choose paths  
Within the little box it itself trapped me in - in "Pedagoginga"  
This is the kind of track that has all the elements to be among the best tracks of the year. The production is modern, with prominent instruments, setting the tone for the track: a heavy critique. If the ne
