**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, you are my friend (Tadiyas)  
Tadiya, how does it feel to be together? (Tadiyas)  
Tadiya, with honor and pride (Tadiyas)  
It's a new year, but you're still here (Tadiyas)  
Oh, I can't leave everything behind (Tadiyas)  
Oh, like the work of a home (Tadiyas)  
Why do you keep me waiting, my dear? (Tadiyas)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  

I was not supposed to see this, oh my  
I didn't hear as if I wasn't listening  
Love is like a treasure, hard to find  
Wherever you go, it's like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, if you take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, take it, take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, if you take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, take it, take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  

Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  

You are on my left, and I am on your right  
You are making it hard for me, heavy is the work of a home  
Love is like a treasure, hard to find  
Wherever you go, it's like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, if you take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, take it, take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, if you take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) If you take it, take it, take it  
(Oh-oh-oh-yeah) Like a thief stealing money  

Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)  
Keep me waiting, the work of a home (The work of a home)
