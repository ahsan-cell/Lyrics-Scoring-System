**Translated Lyrics:**

The earth lies still, wrapped in silence  
And the words you pondered so deeply  
The wind came and took you away  

Happiness seemed to snow down  
Stars in the sky witnessed it all  
You can't carve your way through  
Rest now, spring will soon arrive  

[Chorus]  
For it cost you so much - Markus  
You didn't get far - Markus  
But one day April will come, and then I’ll be yours  
I promise you, I promise you that  

Time and the hands of the clock move on  
Yes, the sun still shines regardless  
And warms up the world around  
Yet you remain cold inside  

[Chorus]  
For it cost you so much - Markus  
You didn't get far - Markus  
But one day April will come, and then I’ll be yours  
I promise you, I promise you that  

[Bridge]  
Look, the sky shines with peace  
And if you doubt me  
Here stands an empty chair  
That the whole world gave to you  
So look up, look ahead  
Soon you'll be safe in harbor  
Oh - Markus  

[Chorus]  
For it cost you so much - Markus  
You didn't get far - Markus  
But one day April will come, and then I’ll be yours  
I promise you, I promise you that  

[Outro]  
..Markus  
You didn't get far - Markus  
But one day April will come  
And then I’ll be yours  
I promise you, I promise you - that
