**Translated Lyrics:**

Don’t let this feeling between us fade away,  
Keep me locked in your heart,  
The love that never lets you go, even for a moment,  
Just touch me.

With you, I’m forgetting those cold days,  
There’s a strange feeling between us,  
We both can sense it.

This madness with you is something else,  
Who else experiences this kind of madness like us?  
The rain of love falls on me when I’m with you,  
When you’re by my side, it feels so strange within me.

It’s good to have you, it’s good to have you,  
It’s good to have you, it’s good to have you,  
My wish is for you to stay beside me,  
It’s good to have you, I have you.

Before you, I always wondered what was wrong with me,  
You came like a planet, orbiting around my heart,  
You’re the only one who crossed the borders of my heart,  
It’s impossible to feel bad for even a second with you.

This madness with you is something else,  
Who else experiences this kind of madness like us?  
The rain of love falls on me when I’m with you,  
When you’re by my side, it feels so strange within me.

It’s good to have you, it’s good to have you,  
It’s good to have you, it’s good to have you,  
My wish is for you to stay beside me,  
It’s good to have you, I have you.
