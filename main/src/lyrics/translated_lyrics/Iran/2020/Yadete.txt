**Translated Lyrics:**

Do you remember you said  
"Don’t drift away from me, for I’m sensitive to you"?  
Who turned you into this, my delicate angel?  
What happened that now I don’t recognize you?  

You wanted this yourself,  
You’re the reason there’s a war between us.  
I won’t bring it up, but my heart is aching.  
How many have eyes as beautiful as yours?  

Since you, I’m growing weary of everyone else.  
You’ve changed; angels don’t turn bad.  
Even if my proud heart aches more,  
I won’t stray from around you.  

Since you, I’m growing weary of everyone else.  
You’ve changed; angels don’t turn bad.  
Even if my proud heart aches more,  
I won’t stray from around you.  

I don’t want anyone to see you but me,  
No one to speak your name aloud.  
I don’t want to wander anywhere in the world,  
Here, there’s only one like you.  

Without you, I’m disgusted with myself and everyone.  
Suddenly, without thinking, I mention your name.  
Your coming seems unlikely, but you’re not a stranger.  
Deep in my heart, I still hold a little hope.  

Since you, I’m growing weary of everyone else.  
You’ve changed; angels don’t turn bad.  
Even if my proud heart aches more,  
I won’t stray from around you.  

Since you, I’m growing weary of everyone else.  
You’ve changed; angels don’t turn bad.  
Even if my proud heart aches more,  
I won’t stray from around you.
