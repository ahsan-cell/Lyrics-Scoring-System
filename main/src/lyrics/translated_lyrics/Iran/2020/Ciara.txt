**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Rick Ross]**  
No, I’m never out here acting tough in my blue Chucks  
Money’s calling, so I threw down the duke  
Yeah, they’re coming for me, but they need to step it up  
Told my homie to double it just to shoot at something (M-M—)  
I left those guys stressed on the train tracks  
Better you than me, here comes that comeback  
They’re looking for cash that they can’t tax  
The cocaine’s so clean, I told them to call it "Ajax"  
Hialeah celebrated when Fidel died  
Patti LaBelle, who knew we’d be selling drugs?  
Keeping it real is when you realize  
When all the lights go out, that’s when you see the real guys  
Back to the true homies who shine in the dark (M-M—)  
It’s never perfect, but you know the guy’s tough  
A rich dude who’s gonna chill in the park  
Get on your knees and tell the kids they’re stars  
Bullet wounds aren’t covered by ObamaCare  
Your funeral was too soon, if your mom’s even there  
Real homies deserve to live twice (M-M—)  
Plastic fork and a bit of fried rice  

**[Verse 2: Drake]**  
Yeah, two point two for Rafael Nadal  
Don’t act like you’re happy for me now  
Don’t act like you weren’t praying for catastrophic collapses  
The catalog’s decent  
I’m still running the game, don’t ask me about practice  
Bitch, you went on vacation, don’t ask me about relaxing  
I don’t know if you know, but I really am Michael Jackson  
The guy I see in the mirror is really going platinum  
It’s unthinkable when I think about how these guys are acting  
Yeah, I never did anything and you act like we’re family, huh?  
Next thing, you wanna kill me, can’t be love  
Not sure where you were trying to send it from, can’t be from above  
That day you looked like a little bitch, you think you’re hot, huh?  
Damn, how can I forgive like that?  
I gotta kill a lot of shit just to live like this  
I had to screw a lot of girls to have a kid like this  
I had to buy a lot of houses to get one like this, man  
That’s why I’m moving totally indescribable  
These boys are at their last resort and giving us all-inclusive  
I’ve been killing it since CB was dropping the Deuces, man  
Your song was too weak, sorry, sorry, man  

**[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]**  
Brrrt, can I talk to these fools?  
I just call it like I see it, I’m not even looking, man  
I just walk like I talk and I’m not talking to these guys  
I’m not starving, I’m just greedy, everything I eat is pussy, man  
I don’t wanna see these fools, you can’t see me, fools  
You can’t see me, fools  
You keep talking like you’re eating, I’ll feed you bullets, man  
I might even cook a guy, everything in my weed is cookies, man  
I shove an eight ball in her pussy like it’s a fetus for me, man  
I got bitches sniffing lines, I’m Adidas to them, man  
I was convicted, took a while and it was easier than simple  
I’m as hard to understand as a fever in winter  
I got women in the Phantom with their breasts out the window  
Long hair, lots of tattoos, and I smell like the package  
The money trail’s on the right path  
With that huge Maybach like it’s a small Pontiac  
All my chains look like snakes, they’re real diamonds  
Pull my hammer out from her pussy, pull her nails from my back  
I don’t relax, I react  
On the scale, my pockets are fat  
And for that whale, you’re like an ant  
I’m a dog, if you’re a dog, then get your tail out from between your legs  
And in this Codeine, I’m a turtle, it left me in shock  
I’m the toughest in the cell block, I promise  
I can fly to check my mailbox, the bills look like Jill Scott’s  
Pill swallowed, house in Hidden Hills, on top of the hill  
Her ears popped, she licked my lollipop and my tears, Tunechi
