**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]
I don’t want to hear your words for even a moment anymore  
Just leave today and go after your tomorrow  
It doesn’t matter who’s to blame, you or me  
One of us has to go first, whether it’s me or you  

[Chorus]
You’re still in my mind, yeah, that way you look at me  
But your eyes shouldn’t be wet anymore  
Just walk away from me and my dreams  
I think of you every moment in your place  

[Refrain]
If you still see me in your dreams at night  
You died in my dream and  
If you were once my whole world  
But now, not anymore, no, no  
It didn’t matter to me how I felt  
If my nights are filled with sighs  
If I once said I belong to you  
But now, not anymore, no, no  

[Bridge]
There was a time I thought life without you didn’t exist  
Now I’ve realized nothing in life is permanent  
You forgot some things are wrong  
I forgot the world isn’t a place for childhood  

[Chorus]
If you still see me in your dreams at night  
You died in my dream and  
If you were once my whole world  
But now, not anymore, no, no  
It didn’t matter to me how I felt  
If my nights are filled with sighs  
If I once said I belong to you  
But now, not anymore, no, no
