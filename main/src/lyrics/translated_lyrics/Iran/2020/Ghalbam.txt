**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**
Was I right, or was I wrong?  
There was something missing in me,  
Only you were perfect.  

In the circle of your heart,  
In the cycle of your love,  
You’re the reason I changed,  
I understand now, it’s been a few days.  

I’ve grown to hate myself,  
Fighting with my own mind,  
Searching for my shadow,  
But even that won’t stay with me.  

With myself, I’m lost,  
I’m lost in my own sorrow,  
I’m waiting for myself,  
Looking for my own gaze.  

I have no news of myself,  
I feel like poison now,  
I don’t talk to myself anymore,  
Your memories never come to me.  

**[Hook]**  
Yes, you were wrong,  
Yes, I was right,  
I had shortcomings,  
You have shortcomings,  
Yes, I was important,  
Or was it just an illusion?  

**[Verse 2: Major Brown]**  
Without you, I thought we couldn’t live,  
Without us, you thought you couldn’t survive.  

You were my only special one,  
You were always by my side,  
You lived in the neighborhood of my heart,  
You were always with me.  

But now,  

Even without you, the days still pass,  
The nights still go on,  
Every day is sacred, every night is sacred,  
Breathing in a makeshift way.  

My heart is broken, and so are our promises,  
How can I forget all your words?  
When I remember, my blood boils,  
How do I express all your words?  
The wounds you gave me,  
There’s no cure, no balm,  
I’m upset with myself, my soul is upset,  
Everyone lies, and you’re a liar too.  

Love, enmity, loyalty, indifference,  
You’ll keep changing homes,  
In the courtyard of sorrow, you’ll always remain,  
As long as you’re alive, you’ll keep burning.  

**[Hook]**  
Yes, you were wrong,  
Yes, I was right,  
I had shortcomings,  
You have shortcomings,  
Yes, I was important,  
Or was it just an illusion?  

**[Verse 3: Saad Khan]**  
You were a spirit,  
Now you’re not the same spirit,  
Why did you change?  
You’re not the same anymore.  

You’re no longer you,  
That essence is gone,  
Memories are close to me,  
But you’re not with me.  
I no longer have that spark,  
There’s no remedy for this heartache,  
No one understands me,  
I no longer reign over myself.  

Today, I don’t need you,  
I have no strength to bear the pain,  
You seemed like a fairy to me,  
I don’t want to see your face anymore.  

It’s true, there’s no blame,  
You were wrong, I was infamous,  
I didn’t know, but now I know,  
I was unaware of your reality back then.  

I’m no longer reserved for you,  
You won’t feel anything now,  
I remain dejected,  
It feels like I’m no longer safe.
