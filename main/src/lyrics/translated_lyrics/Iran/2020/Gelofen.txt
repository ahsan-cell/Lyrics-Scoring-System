**Translated Lyrics:**

Those who can't sleep without you, that's me  
Our love is an airplane, and I'm the pilot, you see  
Come on, do something with my crazy heart  
Wherever I go, you have it all, that’s the part  

Don’t play games, someone’s in love with you  
Whatever you want, just say it, I’ll say yes too  
How cool am I? Who can compete? My love's by my side  
You love me too, don’t hide it, it’s clear, no need to abide  

I don’t even know who I am tonight  
Without you, I don’t know what my end will be like  
With you, I’m ahead of the rest  
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I’m blessed  
  
It’s like a bomb exploding in my head  
I want to spread my wings and fly instead  
With you, I’m better than anyone else  
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I can tell  

Your eyes have gone somewhere, who should I tell?  
I’m dying from this madness, can’t you tell?  
Enough, you need to give your heart to me, don’t be shy  
I won’t let you go, I’ll always try.
