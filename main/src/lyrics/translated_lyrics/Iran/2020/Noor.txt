**Translated Lyrics:**

You were everywhere, the pain lingered in my chest  
In this downward slope, you feel there’s no tomorrow  
You have a fever in the mornings, it won’t be late when you rise at night  
The sky is mine, your star shows me the way  
You can’t distance yourself from me, yes, the world has understood this  

You’re the light of my path, and at night, I don’t need the moon  
I give everything I have for those beautiful smiles of yours, lovely one  
If loneliness were the frame of your heart’s picture  
You were everywhere, the pain lingered in my chest  
In this downward slope, you feel there’s no tomorrow  
You have a fever in the mornings, it won’t be late when you rise at night  
The sky is mine, your star shows me the way  
You can’t distance yourself from me, yes, the world has understood this
