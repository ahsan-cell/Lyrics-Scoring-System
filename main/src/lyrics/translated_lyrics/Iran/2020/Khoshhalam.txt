**Translated Lyrics:**

My eyes see no one but you, it seems  
In this world, no one else can be with you, it seems  
I’m going crazier than this, where is it now?  

I’m happy that God gave you to me  
Forget everyone else, it’s just me and my heart  

I’m the one who would die for you  
With you, I come alive, when I hold your hands  
My mood is bright when I walk with you  
I give my heart to you, yes, I would die for you  

I turned the whole world upside down until I found you  
You took your place in my heart, my world became your eyes  
My heart is left behind, crazy for your ways  
I fell for you since the moment I found you  

I love you till the end, that’s who I am, my love  
It was my wish to sit in your heart, my love  
In your words, I hear the sound of love  
In your eyes, I see paradise itself  

I’m the one who would die for you  
With you, I come alive, when I hold your hands  
My mood is bright when I walk with you  
I give my heart to you, yes, I would die for you  

I turned the whole world upside down until I found you  
You took your place in my heart, my world became your eyes  
My heart is left behind, crazy for your ways  
I fell for you since the moment I found you
