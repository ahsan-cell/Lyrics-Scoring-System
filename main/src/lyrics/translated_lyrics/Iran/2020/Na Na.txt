**Translated Lyrics:**

Mikasa, guns were the ones doing the work  
Pu! pu! pu! pu!, pu! pu! pu! pu!, won't people die?  
Now here we are, I, a person like me without a gun  
So DCIO, DCIO come help us  

[Chorus: Domani Munga]  
I’m not joking with dilated eyes, of course, you’ll call me  
Karao hated the bros, they related, 'cause they’re pros at marijuana  
Nguna has a fake accent, but he’s tried  
If you have chest pains, let us respond, we treat jealousy  
I’m not joking with dilated eyes, of course, you’ll call me  
Karao hated the bros, they related, 'cause they’re pros at marijuana  
Nguna has a fake accent, but he’s tried  
If you have chest pains, let us respond, we treat jealousy  

[Verse 1: SewerSydaa Mkadinali]  
I’m making laps in Nairobi, it’s bad like the hell of Covid  
The area code is seven miles, Android gave out the crew  
The squad doesn’t miss, they’re ready to strike, if you resist in the lobby  
A girl wanted my number, she’s used to digging, she dug up fossils  
Yo, they were followed from Outer and caught on Kagundo Road Mowlem  
Early Saturday morning, Ali realized Hessy had him cornered  
Spider weapon gun imported, you have an AK-47  
Don’t be scared, I hear there’s a hunt after the news at 7  
Today we’re inside the case, we won’t leave, the army is on hand and ready  
Mbleina was taken down, talker, copper, and coat  
Kodja’s army, we’re not on Tom Mboya unless it’s a big mission  
A tourist who was hit by a hawker got robbed of dollars, sorry  
Welcome to Nairobi though, watch out for the wild  
Darkness in the corridor, Arif was turned by Morio  
Android was tapped, Chokoch was at Ladhies Road  
Didn’t you hear you’d get caught, madam, we’re not in Oteto  

[Chorus: Domani Munga]  
I’m not joking with dilated eyes, of course, you’ll call me  
Karao hated the bros, they related, 'cause they’re pros at marijuana  
Nguna has a fake accent, but he’s tried  
If you have chest pains, let us respond, we treat jealousy  
I’m not joking with dilated eyes, of course, you’ll call me  
Karao hated the bros, they related, 'cause they’re pros at marijuana  
Nguna has a fake accent, but he’s tried  
If you have chest pains, let us respond, we treat jealousy  

[Verse 2: Domani Munga]  
We’re chilling, they’re chrome and killers  
Anti-terror units know Munga is a pro Man-a-Driller  
Tortoise amphibian is a frog, Bonnie and Clyde, let’s raid the shuttles  
You should know if you insulted me, you’re the fool, the other day I jumped on Masacco  
Facebook is free mode, don’t talk about eyebrows  
If you haven’t been through struggles with Omo or smeared yourself with kimbo, don’t tell me about struggle  
Talk big and you’re just a chicken, claiming you’ve learned to swim, maybe you’re just a joke  
You’ve choked a monkey and you’re locked down until you’re tired  
In the hood, it’s gangland, if you’re targeted, it’s a mess  
One day Munga, I tried to defend this guy who was wrongfully accused  
Forget it, cuffs landed, I got tied up with shoelaces  
With the snitches, we knocked, he claims he’d squeeze himself through the window  
Ngeus thought we’d been chatting since morning, he’s sitting me down  
Fans KOT want to hear miracle baby was denied  
This is unfair, the girl came to me after she ate my fare  
This joy has Corona, my suit and tie as long as I mix with a different supplier  

[Chorus: Domani Munga]  
I’m not joking with dilated eyes, of course, you’ll call me  
Karao hated the bros, they related, 'cause they’re pros at marijuana  
Nguna has a fake accent, but he’s tried  
If you have chest pains, let us respond, we treat jealousy  
I’m not joking with dilated eyes, of course, you’ll call me  
Karao hated the bros, they related, 'cause they’re pros at marijuana  
Nguna has a fake accent, but he’s tried
