**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]
I’ve tied my heart to yours,  
Better to die than be alone without you.  
Can I be by your side,  
Where it feels better than anywhere else?  
Just your hands are enough  
To bring my life back into my palms.  
I’m sick for your gaze,  
I just want to endure.

[Chorus]  
Rescue me, hold me tight,  
This crazy one just wants to be near you for a while.  
Your heart is like the sea, what’s it full of?  
Come, the cure for my pain is only your eyes.  
Rescue me, hold me tight,  
This crazy one just wants to be near you for a while.  
Your heart is like the sea, what’s it full of?  
Come, the cure for my pain is only your eyes.

[Bridge]  
As long as you look at me, the world falls from my eyes.  
You didn’t teach my heart to want anything but you.  
Until you let me hold your hands, I won’t calm down.  
Without you, I won’t walk in the rain with anyone else.  

[Chorus]  
Rescue me, hold me tight,  
This crazy one just wants to be near you for a while.  
Your heart is like the sea, what’s it full of?  
Come, the cure for my pain is only your eyes.  
Rescue me, hold me tight,  
This crazy one just wants to be near you for a while.  
Your heart is like the sea, what’s it full of?  
Come, the cure for my pain is only your eyes.
