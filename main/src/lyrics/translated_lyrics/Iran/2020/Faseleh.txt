**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Part 1: Our Faith]**  
It's noon again, I don’t want my eyes to open  
You're not here, and I rise with your memories  
Damn the distances  
Damn this world and its rules  
I've never seen eyes like yours  
I’ve become enchanted by the creation of our Creator  
The melody of your voice  
Our bond is a secret that’s revealed  
I spilled white mistakes on your green skin  
It stuck in my mind  
For that warm embrace, I gave you all my heart  
You were my everything  
Don’t say fate wrote this  
This separation was penned long before  
You’re still with me in my room, your handwritten notes  

I keep hitting my head against it  
Come back and make me fall in love again  
Hit and break (break)  
The wall of distance (the distance)  

**[Chorus: Mahta]**  
Your lips on my lips  
I built my blood in the depths of your heart  
In each other’s arms, we don’t want tomorrow to come  
To drift apart again  
When that bitter flight arrives  

**[Bridge: Our Faith]**  
You’d rest your head on my shoulder and fall asleep  
Even if the whole world drowned  
You said from now on, separation is your path  
You thought even if you weren’t here, these eyes would close  
The bottles are underneath again  
Still staring at our frame  
It was the half of the moon  
Who will take its place?  

**[Part 2: Our Faith]**  
After you, a few came  
I wasn’t the same person anymore  
When you were here, you washed away all the pain  
You left, and one more was added to my wounds  
I’m always far away and always alone  
I’m myself, yet I can’t mix with the words  
You said it’s different this time, but you broke it again  
Suddenly, I fall into your memory every second, everywhere  
I searched this whole city  
I said I wouldn’t go until the end of the night  
Whatever roots of love I planted  
Like an arrow, it ended up in my heart  
They say this too shall pass  
They don’t know what last night felt like  
Woke up drenched in sweat as usual  
I felt like you were right there  
When morning comes, I have to take that memory away  
Take off the mask again and go out  
I don’t know where it is or who it’s with  
Is it like me, staring at the door?  

**[Chorus: Mahta]**  
Your lips on my lips  
I built my blood in the depths of your heart  
In each other’s arms, we don’t want tomorrow to come  
To drift apart again  
When that bitter flight arrives  

**[Ending: Mahta]**  
Your lips on my lips  
I built my blood in the depths of your heart  
In each other’s arms, we don’t want tomorrow to come  
To drift apart again  
When that bitter flight arrives
