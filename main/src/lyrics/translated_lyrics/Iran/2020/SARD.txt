**Translated Lyrics:**

Don’t bear it, it’s getting hard

Daddy issues have broken you down

You never had trust

Don’t talk about the past

I’m tired of the threats

Even at night, you’d turn your back to me on the bed

I’ve grown cold towards you

I’ve let go of my dreams

In the end, you leave me alone, wanting me to be bad with everyone

You say it’s different with you

You say you love me

I don’t know if you do or not, no, no, no

You say you fight for me with everyone

I don’t know, yes or no, no, no

It doesn’t matter to me that you’re crying now

My gaze is on the broken pieces, you don’t care for me

I’ve frozen with your look

Your lips are a blade on my neck

You were afraid I’d change

These very things made me change

Eyes closed, time passes

It’s getting hard for me to bear it

Daddy issues have broken you down

You never had trust

Don’t talk about the past

I’m tired of the threats

Even at night, you’d turn your back to me on the bed

I’ve grown cold towards you

I’ve let go of my dreams

In the end, you leave me alone, wanting me to be bad with everyone

You say it’s different with you

You say you love me

I don’t know if you do or not, no, no, no

You say you fight for me with everyone

I don’t know, yes or no, no, no

You say it’s different with you

I don’t know if you do or not, no, no, no

You say you fight for me with everyone.
