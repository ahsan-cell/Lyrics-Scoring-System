**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Autumn has come again, and the leaves have fallen,  
Once more, the cold season has arrived.  
Again, again,  
We have a strange feeling as if we won't make it,  
One more time, your eyelids are saying,  
Your eyes seem sleepy and dazed, as if they’re fading away.  
Somewhere else, the story is being told,  
A deep longing, another mistake.

[Chorus]  
I’m sleepless, sleepless, sleepless, sleepless in Tehran,  
I’m awake, awake, awake, awake in my eyes.  
I’m sleepless, sleepless, sleepless, sleepless in Tehran,  
I’m awake, awake, awake, awake in my eyes.

[Verse 2]  
Don’t tell me it’s time for the bitter goodbye,  
Don’t tell me this is how the story ends.  
I don’t want to leave this home at all,  
I wish time could turn back, and autumn wouldn’t arrive.  
So tell me you’ll stay with me again, everything will be good once more.  
I wish you could say, “Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon.”  
If you’re not here, I don’t know how these nights will ever turn to morning.  
You’re like the rain; if you don’t fall, this garden will dry up one day.  

[Chorus]  
I’m sleepless, sleepless, sleepless, sleepless in Tehran,  
I’m awake, awake, awake, awake in my eyes.  
I’m sleepless, sleepless, sleepless, sleepless in Tehran,  
I’m awake, awake, awake, awake in my eyes.
