**Translated Lyrics:**

I just wanted you to be yourself,  
To distance myself from people, just you by my side.  
I said I love you, but I was scared it’d be too late,  
Who would have thought your heart would tire of me?  

When the air gets heavy and the rain starts to fall, I laugh,  
I close my eyes again to all your actions.  
I want tonight for your head to rest on my shoulder,  
Let’s get a little wet together, just like those old times.  

My efforts are in vain,  
You used to say I mattered to you, but it was all a game.  
No, I can’t believe how ungrateful you’ve become,  
Go now, I’m tired of you and this charade.  

When the air gets heavy and the rain starts to fall, I laugh,  
I close my eyes again to all your actions.  
I want tonight for your head to rest on my shoulder,  
Let’s get a little wet together, just like those old times.
