**Translated Lyrics:**

[ Verse 1 ]

I’m a sidekick, can’t be broken, don’t let them take me away  
It’s not good, I’m caught in smoke, hey, I’m leaving from the start  
Seems like it’s been a week, a Saturday, hearing the same old tale  
Don’t you know I won’t die here, no way, I’m not going back  
Memories fade, where did they go?  
Only I am the king  
Our army, kids from Tehran, Naft-e Vanak, Park-e Shaad  
Still, everyone is behind their shadows, to their homes  
Familiar faces, yet unknown  
To someone…  
There are still my brothers… Mehrdad, Mahyar, Majid too  
Sia, Parviz, Navid, Samana…  
Others are also familiar with our label  
Yeah, this is ours, just ours  
Don’t mess with our work, it’s sick, don’t play around! It’s not easy  
Sina still has the wine, but it’s not fresh anymore  
You’ll see Margiela on my feet  
Even by the sea, there’s a trace of us left in the year of the snake  
His flag is in the circle of all the bad lucks  
Uhh…  
Steady as a rock

[ Chorus ]

They say  
Oh oh… how much alcohol was there!!  
Then they say…  
How much alcohol was there!!  
Then they say…  
How much alcohol was there!!  
Then they say…  
How much alcohol was there!!

[ Verse 2 ]

(Do you want it faster?)  
I’m here, rocking, pouring out the vibes and the beats  
In that cup, the spirit of the year and beyond  
I’m wearing Coco Chanel, who’s got the style?  
On the edge of my board, they call me "Meeko" because I’m like Pocahontas  
Everything is “board” and not like “Sarkaar”  
Still on my feet, ready to fly, everyone’s ready with an open umbrella  
Come on, on your head… Bah bah, greetings  
We’ve arrived, we’ve arrived, so the boards go thump thump thump…  
So the boards sing. I’ve locked the door, looking cute  
Don’t talk about the flag  
Selling out the homeland!

[ Chorus ]

[ Verse 3 ]

(Calm down?)  
I know this corner reaches your ear… say it  
Give me a roll, even whisper in your ear for example…  
Once I told you, my level isn’t your rap, my roof is the sky  
There’s a difference from head to toe in wearing clothes and my manners  
Grab my words and phrases, so you reach the essence  
Heh… we shoot through the air, the goods scatter, they don’t hit when it’s time to rap with us  
I do it, they do it, the bad luck gathers… the vibes are set!  
Hhhuuu… shot up, nonsense… sit down, it’s not a number game. I take it without a rush  
Life is full of risks, grab the moment, as life is fleeting  
See, it’s spinning around us, with the fact that “life” isn’t!  
See, what’s the point of mercy in this world??  
What are you putting in place of the dot? Got it? Or is it a knot?  
Because anyone who’s a girl isn’t corrupt  
Anyone with a beard isn’t a Friday Imam!  
Heh… it’s not a crime!  
Everything depends on your state, don’t say you’ve been given less, God has given you a chance, enough to go around  
Life “for” us is intoxicated with every sip  
That’s why anyone who eats from my plate says  
…oh oh how much alcohol was there!
