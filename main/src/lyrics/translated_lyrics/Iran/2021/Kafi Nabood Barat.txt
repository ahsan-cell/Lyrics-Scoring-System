**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse**

It's not your fault if you don't smile  
Your anger hides beneath your grin  
If you don’t throw the dice with all your might  
If you don’t take control of your life  
If your dreams are fading  
If everything feels closed off  
If you still haven’t reached what you desire  
From this whole world, a pile of longing remains for you  
Forget about that coward who, to be good, speaks ill of others  
Break the days of your life that are becoming the same  
Each day is getting harder  
Today’s task feels delayed  
The sun shines above, illuminating us all  
Moments slip away from our grasp  
To reach it, you must go  
Don’t say you have to just exist and get used to it  
Find yourself, find yourself, change your tune  
A star from the sky, open the door and move  
When no one sees you within your limits  
When you’re locked in, the key is your movement  
You can’t wait for someone to come  
To make a move for your salvation  

**Chorus**

Ooooh, break everything around you  
The world belongs to you  
Break everything around you  
This is your path  

Hey, break everything around you  
The world belongs to you  
Break everything around you  
This is your path  

**Verse**

Years pass by from my story  
From the tale of rap, from the battlefield  
Many friends came but then left  
Many returned and joined hands again  
They speak like me, teaching life lessons through the years  
I’m not afraid of anything when death gives me a hand  
I’m not alone or dead like others  
I’m on a path until my grief is gone  
God is silent; we don’t talk  
I love silence, but I’m here to converse  
This path isn’t for everyone  
You move with me, being yourself  
The road is tough and without direction  
But I walk knowing there’s no turning back  

**Chorus**

Ooooh, break everything around you  
The world belongs to you  
Break everything around you  
This is your path  

Hey, break everything around you  
The world belongs to you  
Break everything around you  
This is your path  

**Outro**

This is your path...  
Oooh yeah...
