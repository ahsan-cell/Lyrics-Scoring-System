**Translated Lyrics:**

[Poem]  
The gentle breeze of the poets of Shiraz,  
Take me to the city of lovers.  
In this secret,  
Deliver our message  
To the ears of my beloved.  
Tell them to come to our aid,  
If you can.  
Considering that  
Our state is dire,  
Addressing our condition  
Is a virtue.  
O cupbearer, come and  
Find another remedy,  
Drive away the sorrow of the heavy-hearted sunset.

[Chorus 1]  
Why is fate so closed,  
Why can't we find a way?  
The darkness won't leave,  
It won't go away.  
Why has laughter vanished from sealed lips?  
Why is the path of night  
So dark and desolate?

[Chorus]  
Cupbearer, light up our cup with wine,  
Musician, sing, sing,  
For the world has turned in our favor.  
In the goblet,  
We have seen the reflection of our beloved's face.  
O unaware one,  
Of the joy of our constant drinking.

[Bridge]  
To gather the stars,  
How far have we run?  
We ran,  
But reached nowhere.  
We did not see the star,  
Burning with fever,  
Sitting in a corner  
In the darkness of the night.

[Chorus 2]  
Why is fate so closed,  
Why can't we find a way?  
The darkness won't leave,  
It won't go away.  
Why are our wings bound,  
And cannot be set free?  
Why does it keep saying no,  
Why can't it just be?

[Chorus]  
Cupbearer, light up our cup with wine,  
Musician, sing, sing,  
For the world has turned in our favor.  
In the goblet,  
We have seen the reflection of our beloved's face.  
O unaware one,  
Of the joy of our constant drinking.  
Cupbearer, light up our cup with wine,  
Musician, sing, sing,  
For the world has turned in our favor.  
In the goblet,  
We have seen the reflection of our beloved's face.  
O unaware one,  
Of the joy of our constant drinking.

[Ending]  
La la la la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la la la la,  
La la.
