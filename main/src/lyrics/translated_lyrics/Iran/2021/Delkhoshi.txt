**Translated Lyrics:**

Your gaze drives me crazy, I’m falling apart, how can I tell you?
I’m an accomplice to your childish games, I’m dying madly for you.
Live in my place, be alive, win, that’s all my happiness is.
Without you, I’m at odds with everyone; this is how I fell in love, I want the whole world to see.

My life is tied to yours, I’m alive because of you, your blood runs through this mad heart of mine.
You’re my city, my beloved, my home, my promise, and my lifeblood.
My life is tied to yours, I’m alive because of you, your blood runs through this mad heart of mine.
You’re my city, my beloved, my home, my promise, and my lifeblood.

You’re a part of my world, no, you are my entire world.
I’m the most human when you’re in my atmosphere.
I’ve given up everything else before and after you.
When I fell in love with you, I was reborn into this world.

My life is tied to yours, I’m alive because of you, your blood runs through this mad heart of mine.
You’re my city, my beloved, my home, my promise, and my lifeblood.
My life is tied to yours, I’m alive because of you, your blood runs through this mad heart of mine.
You’re my city, my beloved, my home, my promise, and my lifeblood.
