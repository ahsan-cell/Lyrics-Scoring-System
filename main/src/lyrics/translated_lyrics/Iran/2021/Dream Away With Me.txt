**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Imagine with me  
That you’re sitting beside me  
You’ve told a story  
I’ve read a tale  
Imagine with me  
The night has passed and gone  
You’ve stayed awake  
I’ve stayed awake  

[Part 1]  
In the solitude of the alley  
Someone is playing an instrument  
Imagine with me  
That you’ve gone to the song  
Imagine with me  
That you’ve traveled to the bridges of Isfahan  
Imagine with me  
That you’ve gone to Shiraz  
Imagine with me  
That your home in Gilan  
Is green, blue, and red  
The forest has bloomed  
In the cold and troubled streets of this land  
A hand in hand with the beloved  
Has arrived tonight  

[Part 2]  
Imagine with me  
That all the lovers of the city  
Have one hand on a cup of wine  
And one hand on the beloved’s curls  
Until morning, joyful from the songs of the gypsies  
Imagine with me  
That this land is in delight  
Imagine with me  
That by the magic of poets  
The nights have come to an end  
The storm has settled and gone  
In the streets of the city  
The sound of Nazeeli heralds spring  
Imagine with me  
Winter has broken and gone  

[Ending]  
Lala lalala la la lala  
Lala lalala la la lala  
Lala lalala la la lala
