**Translated Lyrics:**

But ignoring us, I’m at odds with myself and the whole world  
No one remembers who we were, I’m in love with this city’s memory  
When my tears start to flow, I laugh, not knowing where I stand  
I’ve forgotten how to live, having struggled through every hour  

Where are you, where are you, my heart? Look at what I've become  
See my life...  
Where are you? One night I felt happiness, but it turned into an empty longing  
See my life...  

Like a ship at the ocean's bottom, it seems I'm hidden from everyone’s sight  
No one takes responsibility for us; I remain like a flower to myself  
I won’t let my dreams fade away, so my heart doesn’t turn hollow  
I’m sure that one day, in our street, there will be a wedding  

Where are you, where are you, my heart? Look at what I've become  
See my life...  
Where are you? One night I felt happiness, but it turned into an empty longing  
See my life...
