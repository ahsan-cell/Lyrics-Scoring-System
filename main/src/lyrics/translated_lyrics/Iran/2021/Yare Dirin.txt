**Translated Lyrics:**

Someone's reading your face, look, a madman is here,  
A ship is sailing into pitch-black darkness.  
On this land, there’s no one to defend you, only me.  
Cursing at your face, judging like it comes from within, just a madman.  
Testing your conscience, feel it or burn alive.

Someone's reading your face, look, a madman is here,  
A ship is sailing into pitch-black darkness.  
On this land, there’s no one to defend you, only me.  
Cursing at your face, judging like it comes from within, just a madman.  
Testing your conscience, feel it or burn alive.

[Verse 1]  
Burn alive, human, an unnecessary organism, is there any madness contrary to this?  
What should we say about the devil as a counterpart? An arrogant, mindless, harmful mammal.  
Pay the price until there's a payment in your brain, your duty is to surpass the lesson justly.  
A vile criminal, akin to Pharaoh, the image in the mirror is somewhat pedophilic (aaa).

Full of wise men, your television is a warehouse for the lewd.  
Causing brain erosion, unable to see the essence of education, burn the long ones (burn the long ones).  
To him, pools of money; to you, the memories left are those fallen shoulders (fallen shoulders).  
The summary of the system is wild boars developing against the wilderness.

Be born noisy, die quietly, my girl, cover yourself, the eyes are on you, divide your state from this order, while waking up, it’s laughing at you, it stays with thorns.  
This city is burning, a tiny room surrounded by troubles.  
Those whose sleep is disturbed kiss the night (kiss the night).  
My feet can’t climb this slope while being buried in that chemical.  
Don’t seek trouble, there’s enough pain, your perception is mental.  
Focus on the problems, the smoke will clear, let your eyes adjust to see around.  
Talk to yourself and solve the mystery, overtime is a waste of time.  
Azrael doesn’t wait, he calls, your time is expensive due to its lining.

[Chorus]  
Someone's reading your face, look, a madman is here,  
A ship is sailing into pitch-black darkness.  
On this land, there’s no one to defend you, only me.  
Cursing at your face, judging like it comes from within, just a madman.  
Testing your conscience, feel it or burn alive.

Someone's reading your face, look, a madman is here,  
A ship is sailing into pitch-black darkness.  
On this land, there’s no one to defend you, only me.  
Cursing at your face, judging like it comes from within, just a madman.  
Testing your conscience, feel it or burn alive.

[Verse 2]  
A mystic paladin surrounded by eloquent words,  
The true flag he carries is hatred.  
The wounds he bears are the result of years, the spirit he carries is the main command.  
The weapon in my hand is a pen or an Uzi,  
It doesn’t matter, anyone will vanish.  
The life you couldn’t live itself,  
That limousine you’ll take to the other side.  
Left with nitrogen and sulfur, consume whatever comes your way, spit blood on the ground.  
Bend for those like yourself, but don’t expect this from me, for it’s impossible.  
Shout, grunt, this mind will bear the heavy pain of a bitter story.  
You may not notice, laugh, your corpse turns to ash in the ground.  
Your breath is a burden to the void, your active life is nothingness.  
Isn’t it, king, a world where you can’t even drive a nail is evident?  
Still, you want everything, yet your eyes are so familiar with the dead.  
The sun doesn’t go backward, there’s little time to see the truth.  
Wearing a torn undershirt, inside are ancient knowledge and minimal destruction.  
On the brink of madness, a fool,  
Narrowing as you enter the rooms you’ve stepped into.  
They make him forget by erasing what you don’t want to remember, for him and for you.  
Don’t scatter on the land, it will be hard to unite, there’s a light-year to that.  
Your silence is torment, but living is the password.  
They always tell you that.

[Chorus]  
Someone's reading your face, look, a madman is here,  
A ship is sailing
