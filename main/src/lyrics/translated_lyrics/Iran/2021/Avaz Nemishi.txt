**[Intro]**  
I know you think of me day and night,  
But that selfish, jealous person still holds tight.  
I know it’s not your fault, you won’t change,  
For my survival, you don’t breathe the same.

**[Chorus]**  
But one day, in a place where you find peace,  
A stranger by your side whom you’ve invited, at least.  
I hope there’s no feeling when you kiss him so sweet,  
I wish you’d say you want to come back to me,  
Come back to me.

**[Verse]**  
As for us, move on, do something for yourself,  
If you want to repay my kindness, go ahead, delve.  
Look back over your shoulder, take a glance,  
Speak your mind, let it out, give yourself a chance.

**[Chorus]**  
But one day, in a place where you find peace,  
A stranger by your side whom you’ve invited, at least.  
I hope there’s no feeling when you kiss him so sweet,  
I wish you’d say you want to come back to me,  
Come back to me.
