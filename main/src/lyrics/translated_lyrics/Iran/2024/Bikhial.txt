**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m harshly treated, but I have a long way to go  
It takes strength to be a man without asphalt  
Yet the light has been with me for several years / I don’t know why it turned into a cloud  
When I hear their voices, I feel the pain in my body, against the current, I move forward  
I assure myself, it will be okay, my hands are still stained with the dust of labor after all these years  
Let the days pass with hope for tomorrow  
In my heart, there’s a role that I know will never be complete, my pain  
Let the rain fall on my lonely heart, aimlessly, for tomorrow

**Chorus:**  
Life keeps turning me around, I’ll wear the clothes that cover my image  
Hold my hand, let’s connect our minds… Yes! I’m alive, I’m alive

**Verse 2:**  
From those who shout “bang bang!” we don’t accept our culture!  
Someone says, “a friend who is a friend should be supportive”  
If there’s money, I’d sacrifice my life for you; if not, that too becomes a burden  
Everything is alive, everything I consume, every night, ten times  
Even thoughts of self-harm cross my mind sometimes  
It passes! It goes by!? The future is a dream  
You’re in a state that makes the neighborhood feel alive  
With this situation, I’m stuck with a cheap joke  
A pair of pants that smells like dirt after all this time!  
But I’ve learned that roots grow in the soil  
One day, the things I’ve planted will bear fruit  
And when anyone hears it, they won’t sleep peacefully  
Thoughts of money, carefree, also smell like action!

**Verse 3:**  
My role is heavy, I’m in a place where I can’t sleep!  
If I’m eating now, I’m taking my medicine  
Because its effect is stronger, I’ll feel better soon  
I break, I break the glass of sorrow afterwards  
If it had an effect, let’s count it as such  
Because at night, I sleep early, and the pain calls  
In my mind, I’m in a daze, and I’m lost  
Don’t let yourself be a stranger for one night  
Give me the beat, I’ll continue, I’m going to sleep  
Just before sleep, I send my prayers to F***  
Yes!! I send them to F***  
Does this cursed ampoule not have a balm?  
Because I’m sick, my dear, because I’m going blind  
Because every pain is a reflection of dreams  
The most bitter with various flavors  
You’re all about thinking of the model of your clothes
