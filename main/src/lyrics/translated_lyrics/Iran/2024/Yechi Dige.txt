**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
Yeah, you’re something else  
For me, you’re something else  
Everyone comes and goes  
But you’re something else  
You’re something else  
Oh, what a piece of work you are  
Damn, you’re something else  
Let’s plan our trips and go  
Yeah, you’re something else  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’m searching for it, so where is it?  
I want to tell her, come be my queen  
I’ll fight for you, even step into the ring  
I want you to be my routine in life  
Your vibe gives me a different high  
Every time I turn around, you’re leaving  
I’m going to take out my marbles  
It’s all because of this  
Honestly, what did you see in me?  
Did you notice my coolness?  
You pour your frustrations on me  
You kept saying I was too much  
Tell me what you mean, my dear  
Are you high or just smoking my smoke?  
You’re tired, sitting on me  
Like a dragon, you come into my home  
Oh, you give me dizziness  
Your touch is nothing  
We’ve come three times, it’s a hat trick  
It feels like rain, your body is cloudy  

**[Chorus]**  
Yeah, you’re something else  
For me, you’re something else  
Everyone comes and goes  
But you’re something else  
You’re something else  
Oh, what a piece of work you are  
Damn, you’re something else  
Let’s plan our trips and go  
Yeah, you’re something else
