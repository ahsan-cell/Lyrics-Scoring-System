**Translated Lyrics:**

We know the mess, them, their lives are just stinking bombs  
I hear the alerts, ambulance, police, firefighters, sirens  
To light the fuse, it takes little, our hot ghettos are violent, burning  
They criticize our lives because theirs are sweet, we understand the vinegar when we drink it  
It comes from 76, it's H.A.V.R.E  
I'm the worst enemy of firefighters, I just set things ablaze  
Make way for V.O.R, ladies and gentlemen  
Like an abortion, I’ll kill everything in the eggs  
I need money, my homies, grandma, the mummy forces me to demolish you at 'cro-mi'  
I've committed some 'mes-cri', my level slides, we modify the numbers and the ethics  
Celebrate, I have the electric team and the [street?], I've liquidated the targets  
Better stay clear-headed, don’t show signs of weakness, it’s readable  
My soldiers [on the battlefield?] make the pants wet  

**[Chorus]**  
A police raid  
Shots fired, the ambulance arrives  
It’s burning and the firefighters follow  
In our streets, the sirens wail  
Only alarms, and our mothers are alarmed  
Only alarms, and our mothers are alarmed  
Those who play with weapons can die by them  
Only alarms, and our mothers are alarmed  

**[Verse 2]**  
You think you’re a big shot, putting the cart before the horse  
Problems light up after the joint of weed  
I’m doing 'peu-ra' man, I win if you ask for a referendum  
I arrive and the rising stars fly, make a wish  
The walls have ears, and the windows have eyes  
Ask my guy Ixzo, we see red when the blues are around  
I was a baby, hiding so no one would see my tears  
I laugh, they were crocodile tears but I’m not spoiled  
No whims when we have little, mama, don’t worry, it’ll all work out  
I’ll do everything for you to have the villa and for dad in the village not to worry that the family doesn’t eat  
They make 'ses-pha' Carambar, boarded the bus by chance  
Tolerate no delays, big up to all my guys in the shtar  
Dude, here, don’t play the stars, get lost, my guys don’t win  
Bread, they don’t feast until hunger strikes, so they become scavengers  
**[Chorus]**  

**[Bridge]**  
Cradled by the sirens  
Awakened by the sirens  
This time, maybe it’s for me  
I hope it’s more for me  
Let the sirens ring out  

**[Chorus]**
