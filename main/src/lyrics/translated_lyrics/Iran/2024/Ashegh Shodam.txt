**Translated Lyrics:**

Night and day, evening and midnight, I keep thinking of you  
To put it simply, your love is everything to me  
Black, white, green, and yellow, they all remind me of you  
Whether you rise high or come down low, I want you in every way  

I’ve fallen in love, I’m in love  
Two feet on a boat  
Let’s dip the oar in the sea  
If you’re on board with me  

I’ve fallen in love, I’m in love  
Two feet on a boat  
Let’s dip the oar in the sea  
If you’re on board with me  

Let me be the one for you  
Who does anything for your love  
Who has died a hundred times from your anger  
And has lived a thousand times through your gaze  

I’ve fallen in love, I’m in love  
Two feet on a boat  
Let’s dip the oar in the sea  
If you’re on board with me  

I’ve fallen in love, I’m in love  
Two feet on a boat  
Let’s dip the oar in the sea  
If you’re on board with me
