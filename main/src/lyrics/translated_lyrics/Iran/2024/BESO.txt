**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yo Frankie J  
Kamran and Hooman  
Let's shock the world  

[Verse 1]  
You're pure, you're captivating, you're irresistible  
For your love, I sing  
Your pain is my burden  
My soul, my blood, I know  
I’ll stay true to your feelings  
Your pain is my burden  
Oh you, my entire destiny  
I'm entangled in your essence  
I know that you know  
Without you, I will die  

[Pre-Chorus]  
(Please, pay attention to me)  
Come, your pain is my burden  
(Come and give me your hand)  
Your love has become my law  
(Don't wait too long)  
I’ll stay for your love  
(Come tell me where and when)  
Come, your pain is my burden  

[Chorus]  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Baby, I'm ready to go  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Your body, I wanna know  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Maybe a little bit more  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
And give me, give me your love  

[Post-Chorus]  
One, two, three, four  

[Verse 2]  
Don't say you won't stay  
You know you can't  
For you, I would die  
Don't you know?  
Oh you, my entire destiny  
I'm entangled in your essence  
I know that you know  
Without you, I will die  

[Pre-Chorus]  
(Please, pay attention to me)  
Come, your pain is my burden  
(Come and give me your hand)  
Your love has become my law  
(Don't wait too long)  
I’ll stay for your love  
(Come tell me where and when)  
Come, your pain is my burden  

[Chorus]  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Baby, I'm ready to go  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Your body, I wanna know  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Maybe a little bit more  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
And give me, give me your love  

[Post-Chorus]  
Yeah!  
(Oh-oh-oh)  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Come, your pain is my burden  
Give me a kiss, give me a kiss  
Come, your pain is my burden  

[Outro]  
It would be a lie to say  
That you don't make me dream  
All that I'm saying is you blow my mind  
If this is only a dream  
I never wanna wake up  
Tonight you know I'm gonna make you mine
