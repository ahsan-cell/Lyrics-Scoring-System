**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Tonight, I'm feeling it hard  
It's really hit me tonight  

[Verse 1]  
I'm hyped up in a silly way  
I want to do something, something foolish  
I'm tired of this repetitive life  
It feels like déjà vu all the time  
I want to lift your heart from sorrow  
So tonight, I’m taking a risk for you  

[Chorus]  
(Tell me what does it mean?)  
It means I’ll turn the city into a club for you, my love  
I’ll break the rules at your feet  
Because I want to see your dance in the streets  
I want to see your dance in the streets  
I’ll turn the city into a club for you  
Let’s get wild and crazy  
Bring us to that vibe  
A little shake in the square  
Everyone's stunned and amazed  
Let’s get wild and crazy  
Bring us to that vibe  
A little shake in the square  
Everyone's stunned and amazed  

[Verse 2]  
Tonight, I’m hyped up in a silly way  
I want to do something, something foolish  
Who’s seen gear like this?  
What a vibe this dance gives  
What’s he saying, man?  
Our voices are so loud  
From Gombroon to Tehran  
From Ardabil to Isfahan  
From Mashhad to Kerman  
The rest are in our sights  
Sadness is in our voices  
But smiles are on our lips  
We’re empty behind us, but  
God is watching over us  
A cheerful crowd, we gaze at the horizon  
Don’t tell me it’s dull again  
The city shakes beneath our feet  

[Chorus]  
(Tell me what does it mean?)  
It means I’ll turn the city into a club for you, my love  
I’ll break the rules at your feet  
Because I want to see your dance in the streets  
I want to see your dance in the streets  
I’ll turn the city into a club for you  
Let’s get wild and crazy  
Bring us to that vibe  
A little shake in the square  
Everyone's stunned and amazed  
Let’s get wild and crazy  
Bring us to that vibe  
A little shake in the square  
Everyone's stunned and amazed  

[Verse 3]  
(Damn, loosen it up)  
The vibe has caught me, someone grab me  
Now I’m saying something  
Heavy and really chill  
But I’ll let it go for you  
I’ve hit the last wire  
Everyone hears my shout  
I’ve turned my city into a club  
The cops don’t see it as a crime  
I’m not saying you’re a fish, it’s bold  
Because even the moon is jealous of you  

[Chorus]  
(Tell me what does it mean?)  
It means I’ll turn the city into a club for you, my love  
I’ll break the rules at your feet  
Because I want to see your dance in the streets  
I want to see your dance in the streets  
I’ll turn the city into a club for you  
Let’s get wild and crazy  
Bring us to that vibe  
A little shake in the square  
Everyone's stunned and amazed  
Let’s get wild and crazy  
Bring us to that vibe  
A little shake in the square  
Everyone's stunned and amazed  

[Outro]  
Don’t say I’ll light a candle for you  
I turned the whole city into a club for you  
The sirens of the cops tonight are just disco lights  
Tonight, I’m feeling it hard
