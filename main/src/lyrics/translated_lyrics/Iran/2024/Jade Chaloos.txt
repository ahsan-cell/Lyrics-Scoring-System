**Translated Lyrics:**

With your thoughts, I'm on the Chalus road  
We've lived our love through these years  
Don't say it's obvious, we won't return to those days  

Once again, it's you and me and the rain, with our memories  
The hearts of both of us are tight under this rain  
Distance and longing, that's our share of the world  
Our memories, oh under this rain  

The evening sky is cloudy, the road is damp again  
Where are you, so we can walk to the shore?  

Once again, it's you and me and the rain, with our memories  
The hearts of both of us are tight under this rain  
Distance and longing, that's our share of the world  
Our memories, oh under this rain
