**Translated Lyrics:**

Do you understand my state?
With just one smile, you stole my heart slowly
I haven’t seen anyone like you in this crowd
Stay in my heart, be my companion
Come closer, let my heartbeat sync with yours

If you part your lips, I’ll light up the city
I’ll host this gathering for you until morning
I’m getting used to you in an extraordinary way
You’re so good that I find myself feeling jealous of you
If you part your lips, I’ll light up the city
I’ll host this gathering for you until morning
I’m getting used to you in an extraordinary way
You’re so good that I find myself feeling jealous of you

My lovely flower, I won’t settle for anyone but you
I won’t settle
As long as you’re here, I won’t give my heart to anyone else
I won’t give it away
With just one smile, you stole my heart slowly
I haven’t seen anyone like you in this crowd
Stay in my heart, be my companion
Come closer, let my heartbeat sync with yours

If you part your lips, I’ll light up the city
I’ll host this gathering for you until morning
I’m getting used to you in an extraordinary way
You’re so good that I find myself feeling jealous of you
If you part your lips, I’ll light up the city
I’ll host this gathering for you until morning
I’m getting used to you in an extraordinary way
You’re so good that I find myself feeling jealous of you
