**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
By the sea, next to you  
My heart is restless for you  
It's good among all these people  
I've become your everything  
You shine like a diamond  
You've fallen in love, it's clear  
(You've fallen in love, it's clear)  
In the corner of your heart, there's a place  
Your heart is as vast as the sea  
(As vast as the sea)

[Chorus]  
We are two people  
With two loving hearts  
Stay with me until the end  
Just say okay  
In this world, it’s impossible for me  
To find someone like you  
Like you  
We are two people  
With two loving hearts  
Stay with me until the end  
Just say okay  
In this world, it’s impossible for me  
To find someone like you  
Like you  
Like you

[Verse 2]  
The sound of your laughter  
Says I should give my life for you  
(Should give my life for you)  
Who else has seen someone like you?  
What else does my heart want  
(What else does it want?)  
No one can reach you  
I've never seen anywhere  
A feeling like yours  
(A feeling like yours)  
This is what drives me  
To cross over from one world  
For you  
For you

[Chorus]  
We are two people  
With two loving hearts  
Stay with me until the end  
Just say okay  
In this world, it’s impossible for me  
To find someone like you  
Like you  
We are two people  
With two loving hearts  
Stay with me until the end  
Just say okay  
In this world, it’s impossible for me  
To find someone like you  
Like you  
Like you

[Outro]
