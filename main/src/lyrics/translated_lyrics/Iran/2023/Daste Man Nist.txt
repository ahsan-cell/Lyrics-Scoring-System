**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]
In the morning, when I gaze into your eyes,  
Life begins anew for me.  
I won't grow cold from being with you,  
Your body, your body is a fire for me.  
In this room, the scent of you lingers,  
Come, hold me in your arms once more.  
I love it when you’re close to me,  
Whisper my name softly in my ear,  
Whisper my name softly in my ear.

[Chorus]  
It’s not in my hands,  
You are my dear life.  
You don’t even know,  
You are my everything.  
It’s not in my hands,  
Oh, my cherished love.  
It’s not in my hands,  
You are my dear life.  
You don’t even know,  
You are my everything.  
It’s not in my hands,  
Oh, my cherished love.

[Bridge]  
I’ll do anything you want,  
If you come closer to me.  
I don’t know what I did,  
But you’ve become my share.  
You’re like the fresh air,  
After the rain.  
When you come, I’ll make  
The city shine bright.

[Chorus]  
It’s not in my hands,  
You are my dear life.  
You don’t even know,  
You are my everything.  
It’s not in my hands,  
Oh, my cherished love.  
It’s not in my hands,  
You are my dear life.  
You don’t even know,  
You are my everything.  
It’s not in my hands,  
Oh, my cherished love.
