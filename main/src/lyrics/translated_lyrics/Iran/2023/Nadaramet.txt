**Translated Lyrics:**

Without you, there's always a pain that stays with me  
My heart died the moment you left, it no longer beats  
It wasn't right for me to get lost among memories  
This wasn't the way it was meant to be, but how quickly it became old for you  

[Chorus]  
A longing remains in my heart to bring you back to me  
But love is just what it is, whether I want it or not, I can't have you  
So much time has passed, yet your sorrow still feels fresh to me  
I wish I could go back, I wish I had never seen you  
A longing remains in my heart to bring you back to me  
But love is just what it is, whether I want it or not, I can't have you  
So much time has passed, yet your sorrow still feels fresh to me  
I wish I could go back, I wish I had never seen you  

[Verse 2]  
Come back to the home of my heart, it's at the end of its life  
The walls sing of sorrow, what a regret they bear  
The fire of your departure still lights up my home  
A dandelion on the roof, an owl on my shoulder  
Its hands move slowly, your eyes waiting in despair  
Iâ€™m softening in the fist of fate, listening to the words of time  
Day by day, I grow stranger to its people without feeling  
The past is gone, come and be here, help me out  

[Chorus]  
A longing remains in my heart to bring you back to me  
But love is just what it is, whether I want it or not, I can't have you  
So much time has passed, yet your sorrow still feels fresh to me  
I wish I could go back, I wish I had never seen you  
A longing remains in my heart to bring you back to me  
But love is just what it is, whether I want it or not, I can't have you  
So much time has passed, yet your sorrow still feels fresh to me  
I wish I could go back, I wish I had never seen you
