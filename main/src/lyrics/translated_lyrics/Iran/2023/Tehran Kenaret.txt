**Translated Lyrics:**

Nowhere is different, the color of its sky  
Wherever I am, my heart longs for it high  
One day the sun will sing for the town  
Who has ever seen the night stick around?  
It’s hard right now, but we’ll reach our place,  
The one that we deserve, in time and space.  

[Chorus: Sarn]  
One night again,  
I’ll see you and the stars will wink at me then.  
I’ll sit by you, gazing as if in a dream,  
Baby, I’ll return one day, it’s my theme,  
Tehran by your side,  
Tehran by your side.  

One night again,  
I’ll see you and the stars will wink at me then.  
I’ll sit by you, gazing as if in a dream,  
Baby, I’ll return one day, it’s my theme,  
Tehran by your side,  
Tehran by your side.  

[Verse 2: Sarn]  
Whenever your heart breaks from anyone,  
Remember there’s someone who cares just a ton.  
Here’s someone who can’t laugh, but still,  
His life is stitched to your smile, that’s the thrill.  
From your distance, he’s tired yet still bound,  
With just a gesture, he’ll come around.  
What happened that you turned away from me so fast?  
See, I still have feelings for you that last.  

[Chorus: Sarn]  
One night again,  
I’ll see you and the stars will wink at me then.  
I’ll sit by you, gazing as if in a dream,  
Baby, I’ll return one day, it’s my theme,  
Tehran by your side,  
Tehran by your side.  

One night again,  
I’ll see you and the stars will wink at me then.  
I’ll sit by you, gazing as if in a dream,  
Baby, I’ll return one day, it’s my theme,  
Tehran by your side,  
Tehran by your side.
