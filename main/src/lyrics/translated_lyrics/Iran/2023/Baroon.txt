**Translated Lyrics:**

Why can't my fatigue shake off?
Why am I always so broken?
Why does this hour just drag on?

This bubble won't burst,
Why does no one hear my voice?
Don't tell me why when you're not here,
It feels like whatever I have, I'm still missing something.

I see this,
That one day I'll come back again,
And take your side.

Dance, you dance, you dance in the rain,
Dance in the rain with me.
Dance, you dance, you dance in the rain,
Dance in the rain with me.

From night till dawn with the stars,
We danced together by the moonlight.
From night till dawn, we continue our story,
All under the rain beside us.

From night till dawn with the stars,
We danced together by the moonlight.
From night till dawn, we continue our story,
All under the rain beside us.

When the rain falls, it reminds me of you,
I love the air that
Brings you back to my mind.
I miss you in the evenings and nights,
The feeling of loneliness is killing me,
I want to do something
To break free from this cursed state.

Tell me the story,
Explain this feeling of mine right now,
I want to know what will happen,
This cursed house has become too small for me.

I see this,
That one day I'll come back again,
And take your side.

Dance, you dance, you dance in the rain,
Dance in the rain with me.
Dance, you dance, you dance in the rain,
Dance in the rain with me.

Dance, you dance, you dance in the rain,
Dance in the rain with me.
Dance, you dance, you dance in the rain,
Dance in the rain with me.
