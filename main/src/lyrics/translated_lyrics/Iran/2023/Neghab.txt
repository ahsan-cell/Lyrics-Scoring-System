---

Months and years go by, always caught up in work and strife  
I don’t know when it’s time for our life  
One by one, my dreams drown beneath the waves  
Lift the veil, let me see what’s behind this facade  
Your heart is so tight, it’s like a single tooth  
It’s been so long since these lips have tasted a smile  
It’s always the ruthless one who takes the prize  
Come home to a city full of hungry wolves  

No one understands me like a secret I keep  
Look at me without you, I’m like a lifeless corpse  
How long will I weave tales for your return?  
I’ve struggled so much, it’d be a shame to lose  

No one understands me like a secret I keep  
Look at me without you, I’m like a lifeless corpse  
How long will I weave tales for your return?  
I’ve struggled so much, it’d be a shame to lose  

I can’t not love you, nor can I bear you  
I can’t go on without seeing you  
Where can I go? I have no way back, no way forward  
In the middle of the square, I stand, my heart heavy  
With words I wanted to say a hundred times but couldn’t  
This madman has built his future with you  
Not the one I feared has come to be  

No one understands me like a secret I keep  
Look at me without you, I’m like a lifeless corpse  
How long will I weave tales for your return?  
I’ve struggled so much, it’d be a shame to lose  

My heart is captured behind my wet eyes  
Where can I go where no one is waiting for me?  
I want to hear my name again from your lips  
You be my star, I’ll be your sky  
Yes, I’d give my whole life for you, come, I’d give my all for you  

No one understands me like a secret I keep  
Look at me without you, I’m like a lifeless corpse  
How long will I weave tales for your return?  
I’ve struggled so much, it’d be a shame to lose
