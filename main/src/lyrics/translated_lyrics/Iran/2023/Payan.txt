**Translated Lyrics:**

We’ve reached the end of the notebook again  
Without you, moments feel harder and harder  
All the memories have burned away and gone  
Burned away and gone  
Burned away and gone  

**[Verse 1]**  
Once more, I sit alone without you  
I haven’t even finished my next shot yet  
I’m tired of all these people  
These people are burdensome  
These people are burdensome  
Tell me why you left  
Tell me why you’re not here with me  
Tell me why you left  
You’ve uprooted our love  
We’ve reached the end of the road, we’re not together  
Tell me what happened, I can’t believe it, no  

**[Chorus]**  
Tell me where you went, just tell me  
Tell me why you left, come on, tell me  
Tell me why you’re drunk, hey, tell me  
Why did you close the door? You tell me  

**[Verse 2]**  
With two tearful eyes  
Memories fall apart piece by piece  
Like a beautiful keepsake that’s no longer there  
Like a rainy sky in a wet place  
A very easy path, yet one that isn’t simple  
I’m leaving, I’m leaving, I’m leaving  
I saw this love intensely in your eyes  
I say, I say, I say  
About this strange feeling I’ve reached  

**[Chorus]**  
Tell me where you went, just tell me  
Tell me why you left, come on, tell me  
Tell me why you’re drunk, hey, tell me  
Why did you close the door? You tell me  

Tell me where you went, just tell me  
Tell me why you left, come on, tell me  
Tell me why you’re drunk, hey, tell me  
Why did you close the door? Just tell me
