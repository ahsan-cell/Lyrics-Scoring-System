**Based on the incident,  
I’m caught in the rhythm of sudden strikes.  
From a tyrant who composed my verses,  
By the command of the sky, he bound the law.  
Generation after generation, they gave life to the walls,  
Hey, repeating thoughts, they become déjà vu.  
I am the black dawn, a burning sensation from the glass of death,  
I emerged from blood, taking control.  
With the touch of love in the forbidden land,  
I experienced the most political kiss.  
I broke free from the lock, saw the fabric between the tyrant and the laws.  
You granted me morphine in my hand,  
A wild gazelle under the decree of the food law.  
We wanted to team up with the kids against their fathers,  
Under their fathers, we teamed up, stepping beneath them.  
A world was buried beneath my head,  
Oh, it didn’t remain in every brief glance.  
An empty deep space was freed from magic,  
It became a brief elevation.  
From the sin of poetry, the song of despair,  
Until the sacred domination of love, madness, and liberation.  
It took me into a vacant memory,  
This emptiness was my border, a distance to the wound.  
Wine spilled and the sparks of time, sweet last evening,  
A bitter shadow of freedom,  
Where I wanted to give the order to the crowd.  
Like a body, I felt the weight of the burden.  
The truth of the last evening, let’s search again.  
I am just a criminal behind the kiss of separation,  
But without the song of death.  
It strikes in the eyes, illuminating me,  
I buried all my commitments except for art.  
I couldn’t buy it; they sold it.  
There was no gaze towards the path that marked me,  
A path without a goal, entirely a trap.  
I understood from the iron cell, the embrace,  
The glass border breaks the refuge.  
Tell me, where is the border of liberation?  
I am the one who is lost in the politics.  
The metaphors witness the dance of murder.  
I am the mirror in the heart of the feast of poetry,  
Experiencing more disgrace than going from death to chaos.  
With a warning, I wasn’t afraid.  
I am not the dog guarding the gaze of the dead.  
So I didn’t break the limited path.  
Warm and bold, I struck the sonatas.  
Until blood flowed, the market of faces.  
We struck beneath the pillars of the homeland.  
Pull aside until you don’t feel the weight of your body.  
The danger of the earth, the wound of the knife, tragedy in the layers.  
Dancing to the rhythm of darkness,  
Comedy, natural, a storm against the law.  
I am outside of every systematic flow.  
Where did we strike from the void to the carcass?  
With the idols of history, we ourselves are the sin of our game.  
Now where should we place the inclination towards asceticism?  
Like the sound of our chest, the red juice.  
We shed blood on the streets, the scene of crime.  
The border is the head of sincerity, lies, and deceit.  
Meaning going down, it takes me to the depths of support.  
Even if it breaks, it doesn’t return to my grave.  
Don’t make me a part of it.**

**[Verse 2]**  
**It took me to the top,  
I fell among the blind people.  
Blessings poured from you like rain,  
They filled the box, piece by piece.  
This was a contract between the earth and the sky,  
That the poem would bring chaos.  
God died, security became a burden.  
A gathering of thoughts, a fire of war.  
The next day, the gathering and the pain pulled from you,  
The poverty dragged to the cart.  
In the afternoon, the two-legged tractors with humor, security, and the cultivation of ownership.  
Profit production, export, piece by piece, light and spark of oppression that blinded the blind.  
And the light of God, which was bound to the mile and the science that didn’t prove this broken light.  
Kiss me, I am a wild two-legged creature,  
Free from decoration, the thought of terror.  
My place is without mercy, friendship, and security.  
That bullet that hit outside your chest,  
But, but without falling into the first target.  
I preferred the fragment to the land,  
Except that a kiss of love was somewhere for the last homeland.  
A distance
