**Translated Lyrics:**

Don't easily slip away from me,  
It's simpler than this confession,  
I love you, don’t go.

It’s raining, don’t leave, snow has come, don’t go,  
The world has ended, I’m feeling low, don’t go, don’t go, don’t go.

Don’t turn your back on me,  
I’m reaching out to you,  
Love is a tall mountain,  
Before you, I kneel down.

But still, I think of leaving,  
I’m in love, that’s how I feel,  
Lovers are all the same,  
But you’re different from them all.

It’s raining, don’t leave, snow has come, don’t go,  
The world has ended, I’m feeling low, don’t go, don’t go, don’t go.

It’s raining, don’t leave, snow has come, don’t go,  
The world has ended, I’m feeling low, don’t go, don’t go, don’t go.
