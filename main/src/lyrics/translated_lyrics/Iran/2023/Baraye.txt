**Translated Lyrics:**

To dance in the streets for you,  
To feel fear when itâ€™s time to kiss,  
For my sister, your sister, our sisters,  
For changing minds that have grown stale.  
For shame, for being broke,  
For longing for a simple life.  
For the child who scavenges, and their dreams,  
For this dictated economy.  
For this polluted air,  
For Vali Asr and the withered trees.  
For the victorious and the chance of extinction,  
For the innocent dogs that are banned.  
For the endless tears,  
For the image of this moment repeating.  
For the face that smiles,  
For the students, for the future.  
For this forced paradise,  
For the imprisoned elites,  
For Afghan children,  
For all of this, for the non-repetitive.  
For all these empty slogans,  
For the ruins of flimsy homes.  
For the feeling of peace,  
For the sun after long nights.  
For the pills for nerves and insomnia,  
For the man of a prosperous homeland,  
For the girl who wished she were a boy.  
For the woman, life, freedom,  
For freedom,  
For freedom,  
For freedom.
