**Translated Lyrics:**

I was, I am, and I will be  
Regret, future, present, serene  
A painful past like a dagger's sting  
Three in one body, I am a superman  

(SEV)  

Back then, not at all  
No problems with girls  
I just wanted to see Nene play  
Fall asleep to bad movies  
Nanani nanana, I won’t eat my spinach  
With a prickly character, I won’t tuck it away in my drawer  
Great hopes but so small, every night I dream of being an artist  
I’m the apprentice of knowledge, I want to do everything except be sad  
It’s the S, it’s the E, it’s the V, does growing mean rising?  
Innovating from a new perspective is life, watching the crowds lift up  

**Chorus x2**  

I was, I am, and I will be  
Regret, future, present, serene  
A painful past like a dagger's sting  
Three in one body, I am a superman  

(Bab's)  

We see, we come, we live, we spin  
Here I am in my twenties, living my film  
Bodies have grown, crazy bodies, hearts trampled, crossroads  

Here I kick it with my guys  
Savoring the big crew, the cards are dealt  
No more neighborhood, no more cardboard  
No more mattresses to lie down on  
And my family is well, gotta talk, my friends are in it  
No, I don’t see any gain in a love made of silicone  
It might be serious, but that’s engraved  
Deep down, everything’s fine  
The horizon is all hazy, eyes hidden under my hand  

**Chorus x2**  

I was, I am, and I will be  
Regret, future, present, serene  
A painful past like a dagger's sting  
Three in one body, I am a superman  

(BGL)  

I didn’t have the same look, not the same codes  
Not the girl but always the same friends  
I’d be in the charts, selling really well  
I’d call 2Pac on an iPhone 30  

I would’ve turned down all the suitors  
Giving birth to my descendants  
I’d want to live in the past, return to fashion before ending up in the morgue  
I want to wear memories like a noose around my neck  
The weight of the years will only bring me: regrets, dramas, and disappointments  
I would’ve left my soul at the reception  
I’d be the worst savage, convinced I’m the key character  
Proud to have created tracks that no one bought out of cowardice  

**Chorus x2**  

I was, I am, and I will be  
Regret, future, present, serene  
A painful past like a dagger's sting  
Three in one body, I am a superman  

**Outro**  

Crazy mind, split mind  
Maybe not sound of mind  
We’ll remember the beginning like at the end of films  
I have memories that are hard to believe  
My words are clumsy, indecent, indecisive  
Maybe I’d think better in threes  
What’s the point, what’s the point?  
Overwhelm, overwhelm  
Vagabonds come piling up the corpses  
The Great CREW all seated  
We’re crazy, nota bene  
There are twelve of us, run everyone  
Days go by, time crumbles
