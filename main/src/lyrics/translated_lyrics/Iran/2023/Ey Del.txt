**Translated Lyrics:**

I am free, I am free, I am free, I am free  
I’m happy, my heart is awake...  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.  

[Chorus]  
Tell God my eyes are open,  
I give love equally to all.  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.  
Say a prayer, break the bowl,  
My soul is a question, my body a secret.  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.  

[Verse]  
Each time it weighs heavier upon us,  
But the sky is towards God, alone in its vastness.  
Flee and free the darkness from our hearts,  
Show us the sun, color our gathering.  
Don’t let anyone’s heart hold what it shouldn’t,  
This blind heart, this raw heart, let it mature and show itself.  
Let a point of light ignite in our hearts,  
Night comes, sleep arrives,  
Let it show itself, let morning come.  

[Chorus]  
Tell God my eyes are open,  
I give love equally to all.  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.  
Say a prayer, break the bowl,  
My soul is a question, my body a secret.  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.  
Tell God my eyes are open,  
I give love equally to all.  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.  
Say a prayer, break the bowl,  
My soul is a question, my body a secret.  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart,  
Don’t let us fade from sight and heart.
