**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In the middle of these streets,  
Far from you, I  
Feel my soul and body dying.  
I've waited so long for you to come,  
This life has taken my spirit away.  
Everything I wanted,  
To have you, it didn’t happen.  
It feels like those nights  
When I cry  
Until dawn,  
Until dawn.

[Chorus]  
Wherever I go, it just won’t happen,  
That I could forget you.  
Wherever you go,  
It’s impossible to distance you from my heart.  
Let my madness be blamed on  
The fact that I’ve become your fool.  
Wherever I go, it just won’t happen,  
That I could forget you.  
Wherever you go,  
It’s impossible to distance you from my heart.  
Let my madness be blamed on  
The fact that I’ve become your fool.

[Verse 2]  
Don’t leave me alone,  
With these streets and  
These painful wounds.  
Don’t leave me alone,  
Just listen a bit to my words,  
Don’t you have a heart?  
Don’t you have a heart?

[Chorus]  
Wherever I go, it just won’t happen,  
That I could forget you.  
Wherever you go,  
It’s impossible to distance you from my heart.  
Let my madness be blamed on  
The fact that I’ve become your fool.  
Wherever I go, it just won’t happen,  
That I could forget you.  
Wherever you go,  
It’s impossible to distance you from my heart.  
Let my madness be blamed on  
The fact that I’ve become your fool.
