**Translated Lyrics:**

It was simple to let go of all those memories for you,  
Now you're fine without me, enjoying your peaceful nights.  

In my hands, there was no flower, it turned to nothing,  
Your laughter was sweet, but my life turned to smoke.  

I'm stuck in the night you said we had to part,  
I open my eyes, then close them again, hoping you might be near.  
We were supposed to be here at this time, where are we now?  

I'm stuck in the night you said we had to part,  
I open my eyes, then close them again, hoping you might be near.  
We were supposed to be here at this time, where are we now?  

One day, by chance, I passed that street,  
I saw you and froze; how old we've both become.  

I was simple for you, but my life became hard,  
I cried because your life turned bitter.  

I'm stuck in the night you said we had to part,  
I open my eyes, then close them again, hoping you might be near.  
We were supposed to be here at this time, where are we now?  

I'm stuck in the night you said we had to part,  
I open my eyes, then close them again, hoping you might be near.  
We were supposed to be here at this time, where are we now?
