**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m feeling this vibe,  
We’re sending good energy,  
I’m going up again, hey,  
Still holding on to my faith.  
Once more, I’ll check my hands,  
I grab the cash and go,  
A little white girl,  
They say take me out on a date.  
I’m still very busy,  
But again, I’m doing well, hey,  
Pulling up with Pouya,  
I’m coming in fast.  
I don’t even care,  
I hit you and leave in a second, no one’s noticed yet.  
Supreme in my closet,  
Palace on my body, YSL on my cologne.  
Balenciaga heavy, can’t even move it,  
Time flies, and I’m ahead of you,  
And you saw it in front of you.  
But overall, it’s good that they’re saying Arian is free now.  
I’m heading to LA, playing the game, but it can’t be late, hey.  
When will we remake Iranian music?  
They said it can’t be done, but everyone understands it can.  
I’m going all in,  
Arvin says hurry up,  
Let’s stay a bit in this game.  
People see who’s shaking things up,  
We’re making money, but it’s easy for me, just like that.  
Three bitches, two Latinas, one of them is mine, oh she’s fine.  
I pull up in a sedan, I pull up, I’m in a coupe.  
You’re far away, and the moon has come up, how soon, hey.  
I don’t care who did what,  
Their flowers are all cucumbers.  
Amin, bring the cannon,  
I’m chasing money, but I’m not a fool.  
Tehran plays for me, I’m from Shiraz,  
I buy a lot of designer stuff.  
I’m pushing, pushing, come to me,  
Everything lights up, I’m hitting it with a cigar, taking the game back.  
Just pull something that pushes until morning, only Gway, I’m not a fool at night.
