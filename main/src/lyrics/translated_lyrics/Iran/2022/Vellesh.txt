**Translated Lyrics:**

Only about you, only about you, about me  
If these songs speak only of you  
I’m talking to you, I’m talking to you like this  

I don’t know when to be quiet or what to say  
It’s just that you have me here  
Addicted and happy  
Lost in alleyways  
Drunk, kissing the sidewalks  
Only for you, thinking of you like this  

Crazy, so crazy, crazy  
Crazy for you  
Crazy for you  
Crazy for you, like this  

Crazy, so crazy, crazy  
Crazy for you  
I’m crazy for you  

I’m crazy for you like this  

And these words speak of you, of you  
And I’m a bit out of it, struggling to discern  
And even if it sounds a little strange  
I’m always sincere  
Believe me, I mean it  
When I say that I love you  
I dream of seeing your face in the morning  
Filling you with hugs  
Laughing out loud  
Giving you the moon or  
Maybe a star  
For you, precious one  
The most beautiful woman  

Let’s cross the seas, let’s jump the rivers  
Because just by looking at you, I smile  
Like an innocent child  
Who listens to the heart  
And forgets the mind  
And so I go little by little  
Becoming very crazy for you, very crazy  
I made you this song so you know one thing  

To me, you are the most beautiful  
And you are beautiful  
And you are precious  
To me, the most beautiful  

And you are beautiful  
And you are precious  
To me, the most beautiful  

Crazy, so crazy, crazy  
Crazy for you  
Crazy for you  
Crazy for you, like this  

Crazy, so crazy, crazy  
Crazy for you  
I’m crazy for you  
Crazy for you, like this  
I don’t know how to talk  
Or what to say  
It’s just that you have me like this  
Crazy for you  

Lost in alleys  
Drunk, singing you songs  
Only for you  
Thinking of you like this  

Crazy, so crazy, crazy  
Crazy for you  
Crazy for you  
Crazy for you, like this  

Crazy, so crazy, crazy  
Crazy for you  
I’m crazy for you  
Crazy for you, like this
