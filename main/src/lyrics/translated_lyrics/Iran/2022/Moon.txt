**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Marka]**  
69, 95, we gather for the Flexibility  
We’d like to know where and when these idiots will test us  
We’re flexible, we’re chill, they’re a thousand and we’re seven  
Yet they only pass us if we decide or if we die  
EGZA', 95 zoo, we’re luXe, soon HQ in a house in Spain  
There’ll be stones embedded in the floors, in the chandeliers  
Yes, hun, they’ll come to suck me if I have more cash  
Woh, and it’s not just bastards, they’re my bastards’ bitches  

**[Verse 2: Esmo]**  
We’re not the type to talk nonsense, 69, 95, straight locked in the belly  
I’m gonna shift to the center to take the pulse of my city, need diamonds and pearls on my girl’s neck  
To reach success, bro, we’ll have to row, but don’t worry about that, my guy, I’ll bring the raft  
I saw our future as artists of the year, man, a spliff of Amné', it’s not El Dorado  
EGZA', it’s Soviet, Esmo very radical, for none of these bitches I’ll pay a 10k drink  
Send the cash, dude, if you want us to hook up, I’ve got a bottle, ten grams if you want to touch  
You started your thing, we finished it right away, EGZA' with my guy luXe, we affiliate directly (han)  
Man, you’ve got a feeling, I roll a boze, a phili', I drop an infinite dose  

**[Verse 3: Ry's]**  
You act like a girl, wallay bilay, you don’t even excite us, she finds me sexy, she knows I’ve got the lexicon  
With my guys, we gotta escape into exile, Prada glasses, just for the flexing  
We don’t give props to bitches, every day fuck the occult sciences  
Of course it’s Ry's who’s boxing your asses, cooking the sauce like Paul Bocuse  
And I pull up like in a horror movie, the flow is fresh, it’s chilling  
The more I fuck them, the more I tone up, the whole L'EGZAGONE in your little orifices  
I do it for my homies, my boys, and my girls, I wanted to chat, she preferred to twerk  
Disk launcher in front of the twelve, the reubeu has grown, the rebeu is twelve  

**[Verse 4: luXe]**  
95, EGZAGONE, when you have nothing left, you still have the zone  
Jungle prince leads the wildlife, roll a niax, in the street since the Air Max Triax  
Flexibility like in gymnastics, hustler music, classic style  
Tactical and psychiatric risks, bodies of bastards wrapped in plastic film  
95 zoo, Villiers-le-Bel, Taverny, Persan, all the way to Bruyères  
We’ll pierce them like Swiss cheese  
Don’t care if France agrees, the family knows tanks, war  
But for me, it was the Bronx, selling, struggling, no salary, in the shadows at night, far from streetlights  
Zulu Kings Gangsta, pop our targets, we’ll scrutinize the whole block  
Bitch nigga, are you ready to jump on every possible trend?  
I’m gonna concentrate, the anger of all the neighborhoods in my track  
The truth is, even when I sleep, the street is in my head  
We see the cash from afar, bang, don’t worry, it’s just one less bitch  
The OGs love me but by the time you earn their trust, honestly, you won’t need it anymore  
My hate is retroactive, kings in native forms, let the bitches die and the soldiers live  
I’ve kept my own archives, I gotta do dirty until the harvest arrives, woah  

**[Verse 5: Lvcci]**  
You miss the meeting, you’ll get the recap, Ricard makes you sick at eight fifteen  
At eight fifteen, Lucci arrives, and one of theirs steps aside  
It’s awkward (it’s awkward), it’s awkward, your girl never moans  
When’s the album coming? I said never, awkward like calling Jamie "Jamel"  
To be on the right path, where do you have to go? The past isn’t rosy but I’ll tell you “it’s cool”  
And don’t follow others, it’s better to carve your own road, it’s much easier to pass when it’s not red  
Be careful, by the way, there are
