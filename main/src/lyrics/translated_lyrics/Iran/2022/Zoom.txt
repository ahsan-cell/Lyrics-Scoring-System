**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Behzad Lito]**  
Bazi bazi Lito  
Ali Ali Bi  
Let’s go, Hajji  

**[Verse 1: Behzad Lito]**  
I’ll pull your card, it’s a bill for my face  
Whatever you do, Hajji, count me in  
Wherever I go, eyes are on me, clear as day  
I’m out of patience, my mood is a mess  
Chillin' in a hoodie, looking like a wreck  
Don’t drag it out, just say it quick, let’s roll  
The girl says she called, you were busy, right?  
It’s a plan, come with a few cans of drink  
Hajji, you lost, sing a little less  
I’m relaxed now with two Puerto Ricans  
My crew beside me, acting all tough  
When they see me, they freeze up, yeah  

**[Chorus: Ali Bi]**  
Eyes on me, they’re focused on me, but I’m calm  
Eyes on me, they’re focused on me, these days the haters are plenty  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  

**[Verse 2: Behzad Lito]**  
Ali Bi, enough, send the file quick  
Everyone’s tired of hearing my flow and style  
They say our hearts are tight, go live now  
I’ve got the mic, giving off solo vibes  
You guys are just photocopies of me, spaced out  
In your game, we’ve locked the door  
Check the numbers, Hajji, do the math  
Don’t strain yourself, don’t try, you lack impact  

**[Bridge: Behzad Lito]**  
You keep coming with that street vibe  
So don’t act like it’s a hot business for you  
You see the show, you say it’s going down  
I was up high when that guy was messing around  

**[Chorus: Ali Bi]**  
Eyes on me, they’re focused on me, but I’m calm  
Eyes on me, they’re focused on me, these days the haters are plenty  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  

**[Verse 3: Behzad Lito]**  
First, they talk behind my back, then say they’re my fans  
You say go ahead, Hajji, yeah, I’m your servant  
She says watch out, those fools are around you  
I say don’t worry, there’s no shortage of cash  
They’re focused on me, like a microscope  
But it doesn’t matter, I’m chillin’ and low-key  
You always make it small, like a copy  
Tell them to bring it, doesn’t matter, twenty bottles  
You’re filming, making moves like a thug  
Call of Duty, you say your life’s like that  
Here, everyone’s in disbelief, you’re on the team  
Uncle, where were you when we were on top?  

**[Bridge: Ali Bi]**  
They’re not here, it’s not my fault  
Wherever I go, it’s not my path  
Take a step forward, you’re two steps back  
Take a step forward, you’re two steps back  

**[Chorus: Ali Bi]**  
Eyes on me, they’re focused on me, but I’m calm  
Eyes on me, they’re focused on me, these days the haters are plenty  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me  
Everyone zooms in, on me, on me
