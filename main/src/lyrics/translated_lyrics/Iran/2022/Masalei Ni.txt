**Translated Lyrics:**

Tonight, I'm at odds with the world,  
Drowning in the light of this city,  
The horizon has become my destination,  
I’ll go, get lost, and not return.  
Ninety on the highway,  
My mood is getting the best of me,  
I say nothing matters to me like this,  
I'm so carefree that I don’t care.  
I say nothing matters to me like this,  
I've been a toy of this world for ages.

**{Pre-Chorus}**  
Hey, let me go because  
Hey, let me go because  
Hey, let me go because  

**{Chorus}**  
Nothing matters to me, it’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no,  
It’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no,  
It’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no,  
It’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  

**{Post-Chorus}**  
The simpler I see the world, the more fools I find,  
The simpler I see the world, the more fools I find.  

**{Verse 2: Nabilti}**  
We’re awake all night,  
Let’s bring out the excitement,  
We’re going up and down the Jordan,  
We’re unseen from afar,  
As much as you want, pockets full,  
So we give courage without fear,  
The streets of the city belong to me, no rival can take them away.  

**{Verse 3: Shahin Lou}**  
You’re all about your work, every cousin’s acting strange,  
Their pants are torn, they’ve cut ties with life,  
They’re looking for a quick fix, all fake and decorative,  
One left, one right, all hanging around like disciples.  

**{Pre-Chorus}**  
Hey, let me go because  
My vibe is mellow, just let me be,  
Hey, let me go because  
My vibe is mellow, just let me be.  

**{Chorus}**  
Nothing matters to me, it’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no,  
It’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no,  
It’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no,  
It’s not an issue,  
No, no, no, no, no, no.  

**{Post-Chorus}**  
The simpler I see the world, the more fools I find,  
The simpler I see the world, the more fools I find.  

**{Hook}**  
Tonight, I'm at odds with the world,  
Drowning in the light of this city,  
The horizon has become my destination,  
I’ll go, get lost, and not return.  
Ninety on the highway,  
My mood is getting the best of me.  

**{Bridge}**  
I say nothing matters to me like this,  
I’m so carefree that I don’t care.  
I say nothing matters to me like this,  
I've been a toy of this world for ages.  

**{Ending}**  
Hey, let me go because  
My vibe is mellow, just let me be,  
Hey, let me go because  
My vibe is mellow, just let me be.
