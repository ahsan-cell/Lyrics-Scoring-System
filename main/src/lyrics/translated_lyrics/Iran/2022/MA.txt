**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Baby)

[Hook: Tarek K.I.Z]  
Please separate the work from the artist (Baby)  
Because privately, we’re much worse  
Baby, the FBI and Interpol are hunting me (Baby)  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
I need to see if you’re wired  
I need, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
The FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired

[Part 1: Tarek K.I.Z]  
K.I.Z, the three horror clowns  
Spider-Man's corpse in my trunk  
Grandpa was born in a village in Africa  
And lived to be 365 years old  
Barbed wire around the base, now it’s bedtime  
After that, I’ll toss it into the carp pond  
I look like my parents are cousins  
I’m like Akon, 'cause I have a dark demeanor  
Hey, the pastor's daughter gives me a blowjob in the Lambo  
I write down her number with her dripping tampon  
“You look so fresh, Tarek, what’s your skincare routine?”  
“Adrenochrome from the children’s hospice, ah”

[Hook: Tarek K.I.Z]  
Please separate the work from the artist  
Because privately, we’re much worse  
Baby, the FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
I need to see if you’re wired  
I need, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
The FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired (Ah, Yeah)

[Part 2: Nico K.I.Z]  
I didn’t spit on you, dude, knight’s blow  
How should I know what I think before I see what I tweeted?  
I’ll draw you a Hitler mustache and realize you’re not a poster  
I’ll screw Oli Pocher like Annina Ucatis, uh, yeah  
Embarrassing if you Google that now  
I’m sitting with my monkey crew at the notary  
Nico K.I.Z, I’m jerking off in the mirror cabinet  
And I’ll come back, even if every tiler is rapping here  
I’m lying in the garden like Gianni Versace  
And I’m taking a hit from your mom ('a hit')  
Bro, can I quickly check my emails on your tablet?  
Oh, emergency, someone has to lick DJ Khaled’s wife (lick Khaled’s wife)

[Hook: Tarek K.I.Z]  
Please separate the work from the artist  
Because privately, we’re much worse  
Baby, the FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
I need to see if you’re wired  
I need, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
The FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired

[Part 3: Maxim K.I.Z]  
What time is it anyway? Look at the Rolex  
On the severed arm in the passenger seat  
I already called you a son of a bitch before everyone else did  
I’ll pump out your sperm, just in case I’m not around one night  
A little history lesson: We white folks invented hip-hop back then to bring it into the ghetto (Hey)  
Plastic surgeon fresh out of butcher school  
And you forgive your wife for the affair  
At least it was the Drüner and not some loser  
Mom holds the umbilical cord and takes me for a walk (Hey)  
You emphasize like a damn robot  
But real disabled people don’t get an Oscar

[Hook: Tarek K.I.Z]  
Please separate the work from the artist  
Because privately, we’re much worse  
Baby, the FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
I need to see if you’re wired  
I need, I need to see if you’re wired (Baby)  
The FBI and Interpol are hunting me  
Take off your clothes, I need to see if you’re wired

[Post-Hook]  
Baby, –wired (Baby)  
Hunting me, –wired

[Outro: Tarek K.I.Z]  
“Wow, I woke up today feeling really bad  
Like, ‘Ugh, I hate my life, everything sucks’  
And then I listened to our songs  
More than just a fan and VIP in the psychiatric ward  
And now I feel really good again, hahaha  
That really cheered
