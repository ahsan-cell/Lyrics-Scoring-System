**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Pubon]  
Say you remember everything, say you remember  
You said when you leave, I can't sleep at night  
Everything's on my nerves  
Don't say it's easy for you  
The distance between us is unbearable  
I can't believe it  
Say you remember everything, say you remember  
You said when you leave, I can't sleep at night  
Everything's on my nerves  
Don't say it's easy for you  
The distance between us is unbearable  
I can't believe it  

[Verse 1: Roodbani]  
I couldn't forget you, you're always on my mind  
Come and say wherever you go, I'm with you  
It didn't happen because I love you, you can't be far from me  
It's a shame for this feeling to die so soon  
My heart wants you, it won't listen to reason  
Whisper again in my ear, Roodbani, stay with me  
Without you, I'm feeling bad, it won't get better  
Your scent doesn't leave my bed  
I want us to vibe together  
Tell me everything that's in your heart  
I still remember all your memories  
I can't bring anyone else in your place  

[Bridge: Pubon]  
I don't want anyone else to see through my eyes  
Even if they're just like you, they won't stay in my heart  
If you're not here, my heart feels heavy  

[Chorus: Pubon]  
Say you remember everything, say you remember  
You said when you leave, I can't sleep at night  
Everything's on my nerves  
Don't say it's easy for you  
The distance between us is unbearable  
I can't believe it  

[Verse 2: Roodbani and Pubon]  
I couldn't forget you, you're always on my mind  
Come and say wherever you go, I'm with you  
It didn't happen because I love you, you can't be far from me  
It's a shame for this feeling to die so soon  

I don't want anyone else to see through my eyes  
Even if they're just like you, they won't stay in my heart  
If you're not here, my heart feels heavy  

[Chorus: Pubon]  
Say you remember everything, say you remember  
You said when you leave, I can't sleep at night  
Everything's on my nerves  
Don't say it's easy for you  
The distance between us is unbearable  
I can't believe it
