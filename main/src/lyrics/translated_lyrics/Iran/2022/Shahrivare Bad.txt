**Translated Lyrics:**

My mood is good,  
It'll stay this way until next September.  
The night blends into the day,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's here and feeling fine,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's high and together,  
Just like this until next September.

**[Part 1]**  
It's morning, get up and open your eyes,  
See where you are, look around you.  
Wherever we want, north or south,  
Just tell me which way and where to go.  
Say you're mine, say if you're feeling down,  
Promise you'll stay with me.  
We'll go together wherever we want,  
Say we're meant for each other, everything we do is alike.  
We won't listen to anyone else,  
If we're in a bad place, we'll move to the next one together.

**[Chorus]**  
My mood is good,  
It'll stay this way until next September.  
The night blends into the day,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's here and feeling fine,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's high and together,  
Just like this until next September.

**[Part 2]**  
I remember we were by the water,  
Feeling great,  
You were on my lap, swinging together,  
We were lost in the moment, coffee and wine,  
On the other side, the music was playing,  
Everyone's lips were buzzing,  
At dinner, we were forced to eat –  
Our whites are good too,  
We're really cool,  
No, I won't hold back anymore.  
You get up with me, let's head somewhere,  
Come on, let's go tonight.  
I said now get up, let’s roll a line,  
No regrets from the fun we had,  
Let’s keep this going until the first series,  
This time, let’s not wait for the next one.  
Right now, we’re on our way to Mexico, flying.

**[Chorus]**  
My mood is good,  
It'll stay this way until next September.  
The night blends into the day,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's here and feeling fine,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's high and together,  
Just like this until next September.  
My mood is good,  
It'll stay this way until next September.  
The night blends into the day,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's here and feeling fine,  
Just like this until next September.  
Everyone's high and together,  
Just like this until next September.
