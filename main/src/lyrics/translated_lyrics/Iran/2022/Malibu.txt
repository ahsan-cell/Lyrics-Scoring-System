**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
To be honest, I’ve never seen anyone like you  
Wherever I go, baby, I’m still the same for you  
Because my day is cold without you  
I didn’t want to be alone, no  
Since you came, your hand is a rose  
Your words have marked my heart  

[Verse 1]  
Why is everything fine when I’m next to you?  
The green of your eyes is my energy  
The promises you made will stay in my mind  
A voice keeps telling me, oh oh  
A voice in my ear says  
We should go, just you and me  
On the beach, don’t take the waves from me  
Feel the thrill with you  
So hurry up, let’s pour some Malibu  
So we can dance till morning, just us, oh  
You shine among the stars, I believe it  
Everything feels so good  
It’s like I’m really dreaming  
I’m used to it  
Without you, my cup is empty forever  
Baby, just you and me  
Let’s go together, oh  
Wherever you want  
We’ll be awake till morning  
We’ll be awake till morning  

[Chorus]  
To be honest, I’ve never seen anyone like you  
Wherever I go, baby, I’m still the same for you  
Because my day is cold without you  
I didn’t want to be alone, no  
Since you came, your hand is a rose  
Your words have marked my heart  

[Verse 2]  
Around the pool, it’s full of flamingos  
Pour some more champagne into my glass  
Draw a line on your skin with your arrow  
It’s clear the sea from the balcony  
Mykonos, Marbella, Porto Banus  
Now the suitcase is full of clothes  
Everything is better when I’m with you  
If God gives me a chance to stay  
Come on, let’s go, give your body to me  
You’ll lean back on the beach again  
There’s no way you’ll bend over with me  
Morning has come hard, and with honey, it’s canceled  
The scent of incense next to you with candlelight  
Because next to you, I can be calm  
We break all the rules every time  
I love my day with you, even in the rain  

[Chorus]  
To be honest, I’ve never seen anyone like you  
Wherever I go, baby, I’m still the same for you  
Because my day is cold without you  
I didn’t want to be alone, no  
Since you came, your hand is a rose  
Your words have marked my heart
