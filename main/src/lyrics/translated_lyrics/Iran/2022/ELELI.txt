**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Oh, darling, it’s not like you  
When I saw you, my heart wasn’t true  
Oh, darling, take my hand, let’s go  
Just like a Bentley, you know  

[Verse 1]  
Baby, like a diamond  
Like porcelain, so refined  
I think about you all the time  
Even when you’re near, it feels sublime  
Quick, bring your lips, make me feel alright  
Stand still, play it right  
When did morning come, up ahead?  
You’re beating fast, I’m feeling spread  
Look, no one’s like us, can’t you see?  
Tell them to bring the Lambo, what a spree  
Ah honey, step on it like a rally  
Whisper in my ear, you’re with me, oh so gladly  

[Chorus]  
Oh, darling, it’s not like you  
When I saw you, my heart wasn’t true  
Oh, darling, take my hand, let’s go  
Just like a Bentley, you know  

[Verse 2]  
Pass the roll, let it flow  
Whatever they say behind, we’ll see it all in front, you know  
Your heart was stone, but fell for me  
Honestly, there’s something in your heart, tell me quickly  
I won’t say it now, don’t keep asking me  
You can’t be absent  
My world is a boom with you  
It’s like a painting  
Tonight, let’s not worry about tomorrow’s view  
Your heart’s racing, not from coffee or a tune  
Your lips touch mine, it’s a fire that blooms  
I don’t even know what to call your sound  
If you’re not here, who will hold me down?  
Whatever you do, with just one kiss, it’s profound  
With just one smile, my heart’s unwound  
Your eyes are like a treasure  
Our feelings together, it’s a pleasure  
Like a dream; like a dream  
We’ll go wherever the wind may beam  

[Chorus]  
Oh, darling, it’s not like you  
When I saw you, my heart wasn’t true  
Oh, darling, take my hand, let’s go  
Just like a Bentley, you know  
Oh, darling, it’s not like you  
When I saw you, my heart wasn’t true  
Oh, darling, take my hand, let’s go  
Just like a Bentley, you know
