**Translated Lyrics:**

**(Verse 1: Hooman)**
Let me be honest, I’m crazy for you,  
I’m struck by your gaze, it hits me like a blow.  
You spread the oil on your skin,  
I’ve come in so chill, just taking it slow.  
Yeah, yeah.  
I walk ahead, my crew’s right behind,  
You’ve got all the attention, but it’s still hard to find.  
The firewood’s hot, and the flame’s burning bright,  
My plans with you are solid and tight.  
Tell them to bring the tequila and the drinks,  
So we can lose our way back to the villa, don’t you think?  
My room’s still the hangout, come on over,  
They’re trying to take your spot, but they’ll never get closer.

**(Chorus: Hooman)**
Say, say, say, say,  
Honestly, if you’re happy with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
You’d still choose me among everyone, you see.  
Say, say, say, say,  
Tell me you want this world only with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
Wherever I go, you’ll come along, carefree.

**(Verse 2: Hooman)**
I saw her sitting on the sand,  
If I say she should dance with me, she’ll understand.  
Now that we’re gathered here,  
Let’s raise our glasses high, let’s cheer.  
There are plenty of people around,  
But none of them have seen us like this, profound.  
Hey you, senorita,  
Let’s forget everyone else, just us two,  
With you, it’s a line of pure bliss,  
Bring the vibe, let’s not miss.  
Where are you going? Come here,  
I want to wake up with you every morning, my dear.  
You’re like a dream, shining bright as Rosalía,  
So tonight, don’t leave me in a daze, oh Maria.

**(Chorus: Hooman)**
Say, say, say, say,  
Honestly, if you’re happy with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
You’d still choose me among everyone, you see.  
Say, say, say, say,  
Tell me you want this world only with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
Wherever I go, you’ll come along, carefree.

**(Bridge: Hooman)**
You want this world only with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
You want this world only with me,  
Say, say, say, say.

**(Verse 3: Behzad Lito)**
A plan for just the two of us,  
Luck is always on our side, baby, no fuss.  
A glass of rum with some pineapple,  
Let’s go for another round, let’s make it ample.  
We’ve hit the beach, the sky’s a rosy hue,  
The mellow breeze surrounds me, full of ducks too.  
You promised me so much in my ear,  
Together we’ll be perfect, that’s crystal clear.

**(Bridge: Behzad Lito)**
Heaven feels like being with you, wherever I roam,  
I don’t think I’ll ever want to be alone.  
(No, never, not at all.)

**(Chorus: Hooman)**
Say, say, say, say,  
Honestly, if you’re happy with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
You’d still choose me among everyone, you see.  
Say, say, say, say,  
Tell me you want this world only with me,  
Say, say, say, say,  
Wherever I go, you’ll come along, carefree.
