**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1**  
Baby, it’s good when you’re not under a mask,  
There are a ton of surgeries, and that’s pretty cool.  
Saw the Gucci, and he wanted it,  
Think it’s not original, he wants to buy it.  
The frequency rises, a Porsche comes in,  
It jumps, stealing his heart away.  
Rolling around, cozy and chill,  
He sleeps at night, just to take you away.  
Always ready, early for the party,  
A mischievous plan, wild and hearty.  
Everyone’s in on it, the theme is black and white,  
As if we’re stuck in a prison fight.  
The dog’s about to catch you, can’t ignore those eyes,  
A week of partying, no surprise.  
Only smelling powder, you’ve come this far,  
You gotta stay for the rest, that’s who you are.

**Verse 2 [ParsaLip]**  
Baby, in Tehran nights, you’re in all the stories,  
On weekends, taking photos with Benz and villas,  
The music of others is bad, you’re the one who’s lit,  
Knocking out all my moves, feel my voice in your spirit.

**Chorus [ParsaLip]**  
Numb, stubborn, high, in a bad phase,  
Dizzy, alone, tired, sensitive gaze.  
Numb, stubborn, high, in a bad phase,  
Dizzy, alone, tired, sensitive gaze.

**Bridge [ParsaLip]**  
No rest, just keeps pounding,  
Keeps pounding,  
The week passes easy,  
Falling with us, staying with us.  
No rest, just keeps pounding,  
Keeps pounding,  
The week passes easy,  
Falling with us, staying with us.

**Chorus [ParsaLip]**  
Numb, stubborn, high, in a bad phase,  
Dizzy, alone, tired, sensitive gaze.  
Numb, stubborn, high, in a bad phase,  
Dizzy, alone, tired, sensitive gaze.

**Verse 3 [ParsaLip]**  
Baby, in Tehran nights, you’re in all the stories,  
On weekends, taking photos with Benz and villas,  
The music of others is bad, you’re the one who’s lit,  
Knocking out all my moves, feel my voice in your spirit.

**Chorus [ParsaLip]**  
Numb, stubborn, high, in a bad phase,  
Dizzy, alone, tired, sensitive gaze.  
Numb, stubborn, high, in a bad phase,  
Dizzy, alone, tired, sensitive gaze.
