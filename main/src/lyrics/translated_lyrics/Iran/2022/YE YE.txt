**Translated Lyrics:**

You could be my biggest highlight  
I'm telling you now, this is my time  
To tell the whole world you're all mine  

You got me out of my mind (yeah, yeah)  
The truth is your hips, they don't lie (Shakira)  
I'm crushing on you all the time (yeah)  
I'll be your lover tonight  

Woohoo (Come closer to me)  
Woohoo (Come closer to me)  
Woohoo (Oh my life)  
Woohoo (Hey girl)  

I'm feeling great, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Great, yeah, yeah  
I'm feeling great, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Great, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey girl)  

(You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  

Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl...  

I really hope you don't mind (ayy)  
I'm staring at you all the time  
This chemistry's so hard to find  
It feels like you're already mine  

Woohoo (Come closer to me)  
Woohoo (Come closer to me)  
Woohoo (Oh my life)  
Woohoo (Hey girl)  

I'm feeling great, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Great, yeah, yeah  
I'm feeling great, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Great, yeah, yeah, yeah (Hey girl)  

(You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  

Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl...  

Uh, I'm 'bout to go crazy (yeah, ayy)  
You try to look so cold (You look)  
I'd have to say you know though (hey)  
The way you move, you're so pro (Got it)  

I have no special goal (let's go)  
I'm just acting crazy (hey)  
I don't care about anyone  
Nothing else matters to me (Hey girl)  

(You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  

Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl (You're dancing, you're dancing)  
The boys are falling for you hard  
Hey girl...
