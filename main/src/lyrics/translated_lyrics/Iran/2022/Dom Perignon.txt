**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus]**  
Shake the city of Tehran with my music,  
A second glass filled to the brim.  
Everything is calm, the hands of the clock spinning upside down, just wait.  
The house is filled with smoke early in the morning,  
If everyone leaves, stay with me, you are the light.  
Everything is calm, your body feels wet as if under the rain, just wait.

**[Bridge]**  
You've fallen into my trap,  
A wild and raw angel.  
Feel the sensation of flying,  
Let’s shake Tehran until the end.

**[Verse]**  
There’s no one better for you than me, babe,  
You’re in my hands like origami.  
All eyes are on you because you’re here,  
If I’m not there, it’s in the details.  
Butterflies circle around your head,  
On my white shirt, your lipstick.  
It’s not enough, tell me it’s still not enough,  
I’ll take what I’ve built and push it further.

**[Refrain]**  
Shake the city of Tehran with my music,  
A second glass filled to the brim.  
Everything is calm, the hands of the clock spinning upside down, just wait.  
The house is filled with smoke early in the morning,  
If everyone leaves, stay with me, you are the light.  
Everything is calm, your body feels wet as if under the rain, just wait.

**[Outro]**  
Hit the table, count me in, I’m coming.  
Let them say again that these are the fans.  
I have many like you under my wing,  
You look at me with your dark eyes.
