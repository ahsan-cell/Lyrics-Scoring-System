**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Pa, pa  
Zighidà, zighidà  
Pa, pa  
Call me, call me "Champion"  
Chia– Chia– Champion  
Pa, pa  
Chia– Chia– Champion  
Zighidà, zighidà  
Chia– Chia– Champion  
Pa, pa  
Call me, call me "Champion"  

[Verse 1]  
In middle school, introverted  
Mummy outside, Narnia inside  
Every teacher was sure  
That I was the locker  
I thought of doing everything, yes, except this  
Except standing in a gym  
Hands up, without a weapon behind (Uh)  
All because of a clip I saw  
A hit like a tilt in pinball  
Three guys from Queens, black Beatles  
Unexpected like the "ding" of the taxman  
A roar so loud it reached Chernobyl  
I asked for a stage, not girls and cash  
I only found a line of censors (Damn)  
Closed with the Amiga and the four-track  
Not with a friend to make four tracks  
In one morning, four reams  
Caught up in the obsession of my journey, Ulysses  
Rhymes without criteria, the voice of yesterday  
The face of Keith Haring  
Before the crews  
Before rap was  
On the tracks of Lenin (Привет)  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Festival of Castrocaro  
Went well, not really  
Get out of the way, dear  
It went well for Di Cataldo  
RTI called me  
Then Sony, then EmmeTV  
But in every house, they kicked me out  
Better to sign with the house of Amityville  

[Chorus]  
I aimed to be a champion of the '90s  
But lost like that champion from Holland  
Kicked out from the station of Egoland  
They drove over my name in reverse  
Saying: "That one is a zero, zero"  
From the microphone  
Far from the zero zero  
Of the binoculars  
Reborn as Zero  
God bless the zeroes  
Struggles and zeal  
Champion of the '90s (Champion)  
Champion of the '90s (Champion, zighidà, zighidà)  
Champion of the '90s (Champion)  
Champion of the '90s (Call me, call me "Champion")  

[Verse 2]  
Producers said: "You need to write a piece about this and that  
Make songs that help the audience fill their carts"  
And I went to Sanremo  
When rapping at Sanremo  
Had the effect of sacrilege  
I who wasn’t the prized star  
But the loser stuck in major  
And still  
Never defended my choices with nails  
I preferred caves or a bunker  
But I followed the current, extensions  
Colleagues evolved, they were monsters, Godzilla  
I ate bones with Wilma  
Famous in France like reds in bottles  
At the Moulin Rouge in a big shell  
Well, they were clumsy moves  
I took hits like a wrestler  
My collapse, obvious  
That goes from Cornell to Chester  
And after the dark, Ulysses  
Arrives in Ithaca stronger, gyms  
Thick hair and sideburns  
But the scene still doesn’t recognize me, Laertes  

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
Add the old me inside Club 27  
Resurrected in 2000 and it seems evident  
What luck was my ruin  
I listen to new stuff, it’s just stuff  
The void of a hit continues  
Compared to Mikimix, he’s Bob Dylan  

[Chorus]  
I aimed to be a champion of the '90s (Oh yes)  
But lost like that champion from Holland (Oh no)  
Kicked out from the station of Egoland  
They drove over my name in reverse (Oh)  
Saying: "That one is a zero, zero"  
From the microphone  
Far from the zero zero  
Of the binoculars  
Reborn as Zero  
God bless the zeroes  
Struggles and zeal  
Champion of the '90s  

[Bridge]  
Zighidà, zighidà  
You know, sometimes the finish line starts from a misstep  
You take a different path than someone else  
From thumbs down to grace changing a year  
From thumbs down to grace changing a year  

[Outro]  
Champion  
Call me, call me  
Champion of the '90s  
Call me, call me "Champion"  
Call me, call me  
Champion of the '90s  
Call me, call me  
Champion  
Call me, call me "Champion"  
Call me, call me  
Champion  
Call me, call me "Champion
