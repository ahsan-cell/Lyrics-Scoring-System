**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Poubon]**  
Who are you smiling at?  
Tell me, whose words did you leave with?  
Whose hands are you dancing in?  
Look at what you've left for me,  
Except for anxiety.  
Today it's him, tomorrow someone else.  
When I love you,  
You only argue.  
Your world is filled with dark colors,  
Everyone leaves, and you end up alone.

**[Chorus: Poubon]**  
You know nothing about love,  
Maybe if you go, you'll be all alone.  
You set fire to your heart,  
But it's hard for me when you're not here.  
Because your tears are the laughter  
Of my lonely nights.

**[Refrain: Poubon]**  
Even in my dreams, I'm searching for you.  
Where should I go?  
Let the world laugh at me,  
This heart has no path to his.  
Even in my dreams, I'm searching for you.  
Where should I go?  
Let the world laugh at me,  
This heart has no path to his.

**[Part 1: Tahi]**  
Know this, you are my love.  
Someone else is with me,  
But you're in my mind.  
I smile, but you're on my mind.  
My heart is full of words; I wish you'd hear them.  
I'm left with old memories.  
Deep down, I know,  
We belong to each other.  
Okay, don’t see us.  
How many like us are there on this earth?  
Minutes are passing,  
Taking you away from me.  
I hear your voice everywhere.  
I wish you'd come back this time too.  
He left, he left,  
Closed the door on me.  
His good habits  
Still linger on me.  
He left, he left,  
And I'm feeling bad.  
Even in my dreams, I remember you.

**[Refrain: Poubon]**  
Even in my dreams, I'm searching for you.  
Where should I go?  
Let the world laugh at me,  
This heart has no path to his.  
Even in my dreams, I'm searching for you.  
Where should I go?  
Let the world laugh at me,  
This heart has no path to his.

**[Part 2: Tahi]**  
They didn’t let you stay by my side.  
I didn’t lose myself.  
I rebuilt life from scratch.  
No way, it can't be without you.  
No, no, it can't be, no way.  
At night, we see stars everywhere.  
I fall into your memory.  
Come back and see,  
Why did you leave?  
For whom?  
Your hands are no longer  
In mine.  
It wasn't my fault;  
You became my whole life.

**[Chorus: Poubon]**  
You know nothing about love,  
Maybe if you go, you'll be all alone.  
You set fire to your heart,  
But it's hard for me when you're not here.  
Because your tears are the laughter  
Of my lonely nights.

**[Refrain: Poubon]**  
Even in my dreams, I'm searching for you.  
Where should I go?  
Let the world laugh at me,  
This heart has no path to his.  
Even in my dreams, I'm searching for you.  
Where should I go?  
Let the world laugh at me,  
This heart has no path to his.
