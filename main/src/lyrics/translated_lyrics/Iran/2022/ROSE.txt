Yeah, you were paying attention too  
You’re smiling from the corner of your eye  
I can’t take it anymore, oh  
Under the golden sun of your skin  
You came forward because you wanted to, my friend  
You quickly gave me your number so we could plan after texting  
Like a long drink, it seems  
Has it become tequila with you?  
Your voice, baby, is a lullaby in my ear  
I need to get a rose  
And place it in your hair  
When you’re around, I don’t know where my sorrows go  
Tell me, without me, you can’t sleep  
One day, don’t take your gaze away from me  
One day, don’t take your gaze away from me  

With you, with you  
Yeah, up there in my sky  
It feels like I’ve reached my dreams  
With you, with you  
Up there in my sky  
It feels like I’ve reached my dreams  

You’ve driven everyone crazy, baby, with your dance  
It’s easy to get attached to you, I won’t let you go  
A kiss from your lips will never leave my memory  
Wherever we go, we’ll stay together, yeah, in the end  
Everyone sees your frowns, but I see the smile on your lips, your lips  
My body has gone cold when I don’t have your hands, your hands  

With you,  
Yeah, up there in my sky  
It feels like I’ve reached my dreams  
With you, with you  
Up there in my sky  
It feels like I’ve reached my dreams
