**Translated Lyrics:**

Back home, back in town  
Back home, ha  
Lameboy, g-g-get up (Pow, pow, pow)  
They tried to give me ten years, man  

**[Chorus]**  
Stay woke and get the money, I'm on my Jay-Z vibe (Ah)  
Black SUV, new fame, bitch (Ah)  
I’m not talking basketball, my guys are throwing bricks (Ah)  
Please, excuse my lazy wrist (Ha)  
A couple of guys said I’m a dead man  
I spit in their faces, 'cause I’m not dead yet  

**[Verse 1]**  
They don’t show on TV (At all), what makes this world scary (No cap)  
Wearing a Barca jersey in court (Yeah), it was a message that we’re making a comeback (Grrah, grrah)  
Scars on my hands, one from an AP, another from handcuffs (From cuffs)  
The feds left me with federal trauma (Trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma)  
Came home, carrying 50 grand in cash (Trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma, trauma), cash, like they were my damn kids (Trauma)  
Even YleX spat on me, -X, without any ceasefire, yeah  
I laughed at them coldly, yeah, ye-yeah (Ye-yeah)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I fed the rats cheese, yet they remain greedy  
Saw a demon in a tracksuit, its weapons were its horns  

**[Chorus]**  
Stay woke and get the money (Ah), I'm on my Jay-Z vibe (Ah)  
Black SUV, new fame, bitch (Ah)  
I’m not talking basketball, my guys are throwing bricks (Pow, pow, pow)  
Please, excuse my lazy wrist (Ha)  
A couple of guys said I’m a dead man  
I spit in their faces, 'cause I’m not dead yet  

**[Verse 2]**  
I smoked a cigarette without a filter, I was like that without the internet  
I wouldn’t be here without Teemu Kemppi  
The prosecutor was after me like Messi (Messi)  
I wouldn’t be here without Teemu Kemppi (Pow, pow, pow, pow)  
They treat me like public enemy  
But I’m the guy who makes his own bills  
This pain won’t help (Pow, pow) anymore with my Hennessy  
But I’ll get back what I’ve lost  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I fed the rats cheese, yet they remain greedy  
Saw a demon in a tracksuit, its weapons were its horns  

**[Chorus]**  
Stay woke and get the money, I'm on my Jay-Z vibe (Ah)  
Black SUV, new fame, bitch (Ah)  
I’m not talking basketball, my guys are throwing bricks (Ah)  
Please, excuse my lazy wrist  
A couple of guys said I’m a dead man  
I spit in their faces, 'cause I’m not dead yet  

**[Outro: Kodak Black]**  
Just pray, every day in life isn’t supposed to be "Ooh, hooray, yay, ice cream"  
Life’s gonna keep happening, homie  
What? Pick your head up  
Stick your chest out, homie, that
