**Translated Lyrics:**

Come closer, how good you are

When I look at you, I feel a certain way

Your clothes are all lace

My lips are like Angelina Jolie's

See, I'm mindful of what I wear

That's why I turn into Gucci on my body

Wherever I go, see, I'm there

They call me "Daddy," even though I'm younger than them

I roll with the blunt

We’re cruising through Tehran

I'm so good and high up that

You hear my voice everywhere

You hear my voice everywhere

I’m a hundred when I’m sixty in the mix

My girl behind the wheel gives me a lip dance

Everyone’s following me, it’s a vibe

They’re throwing lines like it’s Lex

If you want me, don’t let me go, yeah, don’t lose me

So hurry up, don’t hesitate, yeah, hands up

Because suddenly you’ll see the paths are blocked

And by then, it’s too exhausting

She says she feels bad, what kind of feeling is this?

You’re not feeling bad, baby, yeah, it’s just Hennessy

Don’t take it too hard, see, loosen up life

It’s like it’s penicillin

A little calmer now

No, not to that extent

See, it’s not enough, we need to rise higher

Let’s get more wrecked

Let’s get more wrecked.
