**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(Ha, ha, ha)

[Verse 1]  
Many years from now, will I still  
Forget to bring my keys? Mmm  
Many years from now, will you still  
Like to sleep in for an hour?

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’ll write a letter, asking about us in the years to come  
Send it to a future address  
By then, my eyes can barely see  
Hands trembling as I open that letter, reading this line

[Chorus]  
Probably after several battles, experiencing a plague  
The Earth enters an ice age  
Scientists solve the gravity problem, everyone moves to distant stars  
Oh, only we remain here  
I’ll be by your side, many years and many years later  
After the tides have changed, after civilization has vanished  
Still holding your hand  
Mmm  
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]  
Even after many years, I still remember  
The day we met under a clear blue sky, yay, yay  
Even if many years pass, I never forget  
The cold rain during our first kiss

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’ll write a song, putting all the unforgettable moments into lyrics  
Send it to a future address  
By then, my ears can barely hear  
Vaguely recalling half a melody, singing hoarsely

[Chorus]  
Probably after several battles, experiencing a plague  
The Earth enters an ice age  
Scientists solve the gravity problem, everyone moves to distant stars  
Oh, only we remain here  
I’ll be by your side, many years and many years later  
After the tides have changed, after civilization has vanished  
Still wanting to hold your hand  
Mm, mmm

[Chorus]  
No matter how many centuries pass, no matter how many centuries  
Everything returns to the Cambrian period  
Everyone has given up on this place, leaving us behind  
Oh, together with you, never to part  
This vow remains unchanged for a hundred years, a thousand years,  
Ten thousand years

[Outro]  
(Ha) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
(Ha)  
(Ha) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
(Ha) Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
(Ha)  
(Ha)
