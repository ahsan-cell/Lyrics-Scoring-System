**Translated Lyrics:**

You said you wanted to break up, a blunt excuse  
Because you’re afraid I might leave you first  
Now you just want to say goodbye, it’s all too sudden for me  
Right now, I just want to move, move next door to Taimali  

No need to argue over who’s wrong or right  
When love reaches its end, you step back while I advance, uh  
If I give my all and you treat it like it’s nothing  
Let me bear the blame for this failed love  
A woman’s precious youth can’t be wasted  
A tragic ending, just one person left in despair  
Now stop, let’s not make this so exhausting, I’ll carry it  

I’m handsome enough to break up, but lacking in security  
You chose to chase after money, reality hits me hard  
I’m handsome enough to break up, but lacking in security  
You chose to chase after money, turns out you’re a pro, you do all the talking  

When I gave you all my love, you pushed me away  
I don’t really care anymore  
Don’t really care anymore  
When I gave you all my love, you pushed me away  
I don’t really care anymore  
Don’t really care anymore  

The affection I gave you, tossed into the trash, you turned and left  
You said I don’t understand, what’s the use of love, it’s all my fault  
Now I just want to say goodbye to you, no more lying to myself  
Right now, I just want to move, move next door to Taimali  

No need to argue over who’s wrong or right  
When love reaches its end, you step back while I advance, uh  
If I give my all and you treat it like it’s nothing  
Let me bear the blame for this failed love  
A woman’s precious youth can’t be wasted  
A tragic ending, just one person left in despair  
Now stop, let’s not make this so exhausting, I’ll carry it  

I’m handsome enough to break up, but lacking in security  
You chose to chase after money, reality hits me hard  
I’m handsome enough to break up, but lacking in security  
You chose to chase after money, turns out you’re a pro  
I’m handsome enough to break up, you chose to chase after money  

I’m handsome enough to break up  
When I gave you all my love, you pushed me away  
I don’t really care anymore  
Don’t really care anymore  
When I gave you all my love, you pushed me away  
I don’t really care anymore  
Don’t really care anymore
