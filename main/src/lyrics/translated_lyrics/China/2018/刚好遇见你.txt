**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
We cried,  
We laughed,  
We looked up at the sky,  
A few stars still shining bright.  
We sang,  
The song of time,  
Only then did we understand  
What it means to embrace each other.

[Chorus]  
Because I just happened to meet you,  
Leaving footprints makes it beautiful.  
The wind blows, flowers fall, tears like rain,  
Because I don’t want to part.  
Because I just happened to meet you,  
Leaving ten years of hopes.  
If we meet again,  
I think I will remember you.

[Verse 2]  
We cried,  
We laughed,  
We looked up at the sky,  
A few stars still shining bright.  
We sang,  
The song of time,  
Only then did we understand  
What it means to embrace each other.

[Chorus]  
Because I just happened to meet you,  
Leaving footprints makes it beautiful.  
The wind blows, flowers fall, tears like rain,  
Because I don’t want to part.  
Because I just happened to meet you,  
Leaving ten years of hopes.  
If we meet again,  
I think I will remember you.

Because I just happened to meet you,  
Leaving footprints makes it beautiful.  
The wind blows, flowers fall, tears like rain,  
Because I don’t want to part.  
Because I just happened to meet you,  
Leaving ten years of hopes.  
If we meet again,  
I think I will remember you.
