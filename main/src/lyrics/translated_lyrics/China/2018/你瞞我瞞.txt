**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Dating feels like sharing a feast to the full,  
With any troubles, yet we don’t bring them up.  
If this is romance, why do I feel we’re drifting apart?  
You’ve cried, but your eyeshadow shines even brighter.  
Who am I to you? You remain just yourself.  
In silence, we exchange smiles; laughter is sadder than tears.  
Even if we’re happy, frowning still,  
Though I hold you tightly in my arms,  
They still separate me from you.

[Chorus]  
Silent kisses invade my heart,  
Yet I’d rather hear you say you’re so tired.  
If there’s someone else in your heart,  
Someone you’re hiding from me,  
I’m also hiding from myself,  
We fit too well.

[Verse 2]  
This is what love is—so polite it scares me.  
Aside from being busy lately, how much do I really know?  
If we’re going to cry, why not just let it out?  
Arguing and bickering is better than nothing at all,  
Better than holding me without a sound.  

[Chorus]  
Silent kisses invade my heart,  
Yet I’d rather hear you say you’re so tired.  
If there’s someone else in your heart,  
Someone you’re hiding from me,  
I’m also hiding from myself,  
We fit too well.

[Bridge]  
What kind of lonely love is this?  
You wrap me with your fingertips, using heated kisses to escape me.

[Chorus]  
Silent kisses invade my heart,  
Yet I’d rather hear you say you’re so tired.  
If there’s someone else in your heart,  
Someone you’re hiding from me,  
I’m also hiding from myself,  
We fit too well.
