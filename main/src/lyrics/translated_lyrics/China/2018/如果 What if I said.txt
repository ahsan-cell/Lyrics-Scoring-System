**Translated Lyrics:**

Can't press send on this message,  
In the twists and turns, an unfinished dream,  
Even the pillow feels lonely.  

Memories pass by, spilling a thousand words,  
The things I want to say to you lie deep in my heart,  
Words and expressions I've written and deleted,  
Maybe the silence speaks the loudest.  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  
We used to be so happy together.  
If young love is destined to part,  
Should I have waited a little longer to say?  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  

Afraid of losing, so I doubt,  
That's why I run away.  
The fear of love after the embrace,  
Isn't it just you who feels this way?  

Memories pass by, spilling a thousand words,  
The things I want to say to you lie deep in my heart,  
Words and expressions I've written and deleted,  
Still, I lack the courage to say I miss you.  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  
We used to be so happy together.  
If young love is destined to part,  
Should I have waited a little longer to say?  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  
We used to be so happy together.  
If young love...  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?  
We used to be so happy together.  
If young love is destined to part,  
Should I have waited a little longer to say?  

What if I said, "Don't turn away"?
