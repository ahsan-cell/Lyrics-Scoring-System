**Translated Lyrics:**

Every word feels like a trap,  
Old grievances never seem to end, who stirs up trouble?  
Your hands shake off the delicate balance just right,  
And then the flames of war ignite once more.  

We embrace back to back,  
Abusing silence while we shout,  
Love doesn’t have time to grow old,  
Buried in the jest of the battlefield.  

We embrace back to back,  
Truths circling around in chaos,  
Just want you to know,  
Just want me to know, the warning of love.  

Words never come out clear, how to make sense of it all?  
Every word feels like a trap,  
Old grievances never seem to end, who stirs up trouble?  
Your hands shake off the delicate balance just right,  
And then the flames of war ignite once more.  

We embrace back to back,  
Abusing silence while we shout,  
Love doesn’t have time to grow old,  
Buried in the jest of the battlefield.  

We embrace back to back,  
Truths circling around in chaos,  
Just want you to know,  
Just want me to know, the warning of love.  

I don’t want it to come to this, becoming strangers by choice,  
Since we can embrace, let’s not let go so easily.  

We embrace back to back,  
Abusing silence while we shout,  
Love doesn’t have time to grow old,  
Buried in the jest of the battlefield.  

We embrace back to back,  
Truths circling around in chaos,  
Just want you to know,  
Just want me to know, this warning.  

Just want you to know,  
Just want me to know, the warning of love.
