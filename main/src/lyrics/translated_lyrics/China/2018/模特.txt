**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse]  
Standing in beautiful clothes to satisfy primitive desires,  
Holding up a fragile city with a perfect expression.  
I coldly accept your anxious waiting, feeling trapped as well,  
Like countless models living in display cases.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What else can I see aside from the light?  
What else can I ask for aside from the brightness?  
Who else can I rely on aside from you?  
What are you shouting from a thousand miles away?  
What will you want to remember after a hundred years?  
Can I see that moment again before I leave?

[Chorus]  
Remember that your eyes will brighten,  
And my arms will be waving.  
Who says there are already no options in the world?  
While we have the chance, I'll feel pleasure and anger while you feel sorrow and joy.  
We'll sing a few minutes of a love song,  
It's nothing much, but at least it's proof we're still alive.

[Verse]  
Like an innocent butterfly flying for the sweetness of roses,  
Like a playful kitten sleeping in curiosity for tomorrow.  
Even if it's a chaotic time or a transparent prison, itâ€™s still felt,  
That you can't continue being a model in a display case.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What else can I hear aside from the wind?  
What else can I reject aside from the dust?  
Who else can I rely on aside from you?  
What are you shouting from a thousand miles away?  
What will you want to remember after a hundred years?  
Can I see that moment again before I leave?

[Chorus]  
Remember that your eyes will brighten,  
And my arms will be waving.  
Who says there are already no options in the world?  
While we have the chance, I'll feel pleasure and anger while you feel sorrow and joy.  
We'll sing a few minutes of a love song,  
It's nothing much, but at least it's proof we're still alive.
