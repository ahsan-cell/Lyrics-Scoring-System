**Translated Lyrics:**

The process was peaceful,  
Walking together, thinking it was forever,  
But this day has still come.

I’m not innocent,  
You just clearly  
No longer love me.

A breakup without a third party  
Turns out to be more painful than betrayal.  
From both objective and subjective views,  
The bad guy is always me, unable to let go.

I can’t hate others,  
I can’t shift the blame.  
After years of love, the issues remain unresolved,  
It’s time to face it.

I’d rather it be someone else  
Gently taking you away,  
I can only admit it.

A breakup without a third party  
Turns out to hurt more than fulfilling anyone.  
We were wrong for refusing to make mistakes,  
Should have left long ago, yet remained indifferent.  
What’s the point of feeling wronged?  
Is there really another choice?  
What hurts more than simple disappointment  
Is the sadness it brings.

A breakup without a third party  
Feels like a kind of isolating loneliness.  
I can’t even express how much I want to be dramatic,  
So I can only admit it.  
Wanting to be the victim or someone who hates you,  
Neither can be.
