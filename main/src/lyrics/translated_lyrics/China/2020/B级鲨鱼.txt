**Translated Lyrics:**

I must strive,  
To prove myself, I’ll dive into battles with squids,  
In electric games.  

No matter what, I’ll keep living,  
Swap my frown for a smile, endorsing toothpaste.  
No wonder the world loves and hates me,  
Some curse me for my jokes,  
Devouring Andersen—nothing’s impossible.  

So dangerous,  
Who doesn’t need a guardian angel?  
Care for us,  
Give me a kiss.  
Dangerous,  
With nuclear waters, I sip and glide,  
A vibrant life, so full of color.  

Watch me demonstrate how to thrive amidst chaos,  
Building muscle before the grind.  
Come on, all vertebrates, sing your debut song with me,  
Aiming for the spotlight.  

No matter what, I’ll keep living,  
Let’s host a live stream, promoting vegetarian hotpot.  
No wonder the world loves and hates me,  
Some praise my special powers,  
Devouring Andersen—nothing’s impossible.

Who doesn’t need a guardian angel?  
Care for us,  
Give me a kiss.  
Dangerous,  
With nuclear waters, I sip and glide,  
A vibrant life, so full of color.  

Dangerous,  
Who doesn’t need a guardian angel?  
Care for us,  
Find me another way.  
Dangerous,  
With nuclear waters, I sip and glide,  
A vibrant life, so full of color.  
Gene alteration,  
Transforming into a god.  

Dangerous,  
In this world, sweet and sour, bitter and spicy,  
How could I ever lose my composure?  
How could it be?
