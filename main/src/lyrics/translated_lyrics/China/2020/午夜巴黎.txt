**Translated Lyrics:**

Still echoing in my dreams,  
The scent of romance,  
Like a scene from a movie.  

I long to see again  
The beautiful views beneath the tower,  
But now I can only admire  
The memories on my phone.  

French songs,  
The trills are so sweet,  
Couples in restaurants,  
Their eyes overflowing with happiness.  
Occasionally turning their heads,  
Radiating the ease of life,  
Every little moment is a memory.  

Mon amour  
(Dear one)  
Je t'aime  
(I love you)  
Tu es l'amour de ma vie  
(You are the love of my life)  
Is there someone out there searching for the same dream?  
When will I be able to set off on my journey?  
I can only look forward to after the pandemic,  
To embark again and fulfill my dreams.
