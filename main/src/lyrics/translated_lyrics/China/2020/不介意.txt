**Translated Lyrics:**

I just want to hold your body, nothing else matters  
The bedroom feels as crowded as the sea, I don’t mind at all  
Every second feels more intimate than the last  

I need to see your figure, nothing else matters  
I need to breathe your breath, nothing else matters  
No matter how crowded the world outside, I don’t mind  
I don’t care about the ways of the world or the changing seasons  

But why?  
Is it that the passion is gone?  
Or are you just enduring?  
But why?  
Rather than talk about the future, let’s seize the moment now  

In a city rushing into pleasure,  
Your scent is worth more than countless encounters  
Just quietly waiting for my nail polish to dry,  
From Sunday all the way to Saturday  

I just want to hear your voice, nothing else matters  
I just want to hold your body, nothing else matters  
The bedroom feels as crowded as the sea, I don’t mind at all  
Every second feels more intimate than the last  

If the world were just you and me, there’d be no need to worry  
Subtropical weather,  
Rainy yet sunny,  
Is it me or you that’s overflowing?  

But why?  
Is it that the passion is gone?  
Or are you just enduring?  
But why?  
Rather than talk about the future, let’s seize the moment now  

In a city rushing into pleasure,  
Your scent is worth more than countless encounters  
Just quietly waiting for my nail polish to dry,  
From Sunday all the way to Saturday  

I just want to hear your voice, nothing else matters  
I just want to hold your body, nothing else matters  
No matter how crowded the world outside, I don’t mind  
I don’t care about the ways of the world or the changing seasons
