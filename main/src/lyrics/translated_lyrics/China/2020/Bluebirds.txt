**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Bluebirds, bluebirds in the sky  
Tell me that I'll be alright  
Bluebirds, bluebirds flying high  
Tell me it will be alright  

[Verse 1]  
The road ahead seems a bit blurry  
I can't see clearly  
I can't shake off this despair inside  
Damn this despair  
I long to fly to a place with no one around  
Where I can bury it completely  
Looking at the sky, I shout, please give me back my freedom  

[Chorus]  
Bluebirds, bluebirds in the sky  
Tell me that I'll be alright  
Woah, bluebirds, bluebirds flying high  
Tell me it will be alright  

[Verse 2]  
The starlight twinkles, offering countless promises  
Emotional fireworks  
Tired of lies, tired of the world's disputes  
Damn these disputes  
I long to fly to the farthest place  
Where everything is kind  
Looking at the sky, I shout, please give me back my hope  

[Chorus]  
Bluebirds, bluebirds in the sky  
Tell me that I'll be alright  
Woah, bluebirds, bluebirds flying high  
Tell me it will be alright  

[Interlude]  

[Chorus]  
Bluebirds, bluebirds in the sky  
Tell me that I'll be alright  
Woah, bluebirds, bluebirds flying high  
Tell me it will be alright  

[Chorus]  
Bluebirds in the sky  
Tell me that I'll be alright  
Woah, bluebirds, bluebirds flying high  
Tell me we will be alright  

[Outro]  
Woah, bluebirds, bluebirds flying high  
Tell me we will be alright
