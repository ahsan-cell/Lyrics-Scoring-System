**Translated Lyrics:**

Waiting for your call  
I've been thinking about us  
Just reflecting on it  
Tell me why you won't believe it  

Baby, I swear  
Things are really tough  
I've been in my feelings  
You can see it from afar  
Yeah, I just keep reminiscing  

Oh, he has no right to be  
I'm about to change the scene  
You better be running away, running away  

Ah, he has no right to be  
I'm about to shift the scene  
You better be running away, running away  

Oh, you let me live a lie  
Just look inside  
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like  

Oh, you let me live a lie  
Just look inside  
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like  

Be honest  
I can change the way you see yourself  
I promise no one else  
I'm not joking because girl, you're so beautiful  
You're so beautiful  
I'm gonna give it all to you  
Tell me how you want it  
Tell me how you feel it  
Ain't no limit, baby  

Oh, he has no right to be  
I'm about to change the scene  
You better be running away, running away  

Oh, he has no right to be  
I'm about to shift the scene  
You better be running away, running away  

Floor lamp, blinds  
Baby, your scent lingers by the southern mountain  
Water lilies drifting in the middle of the water  
Pearls scattered into my heart  
Maple leaves red, bamboo green  
How can I gain without losing, leaving me no choice?  
People donâ€™t return, but the wind has gone  
Not drunk, not returning, not seeing, not satisfied  

Oh, you let me live a lie  
Just look inside  
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like  

Oh, you let me live a lie  
Just look inside  
Then tell me, tell me what it feels like
