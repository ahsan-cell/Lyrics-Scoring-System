**Translated Lyrics:**

It's that Young Sinatra IV shit right here  
Young Sinatra IV is coming in strong  
(Rest in peace Mac Miller)  
(RIP Mac Miller)  
It's been like 10 years  
It's been about ten years now  
Here we go (Yeah)  
Alright, let’s go!

[Verse 1]  
Visualizing and realizing my life is fucking crazy  
Imagining made me realize how wild my life is  
Poppin' like JAY-Z, Dirty Dancing on the game like Swayze  
Cool like JAY-Z, I’m the playboy of this rap game like Swayze  
I'm one of the illest, and bitch  
I’m the underdog,  
I've been ready to kill it, it's so amazing  
But I’ve been prepared, ha  
Bitch, I've been blazing, I'm talking grass, I ain't talking grazing  
Fool, I’ve stood at the top, spitting the best lines, this ain’t a joke  
They just hit the tape while I sip scotch  
As I drink my scotch, the music starts to play  
Let the haters kick rocks, my shit is tip-top  
Let them be jealous  
I never flip-flop, why? 'Cause my soul's too strong  
I’ve never failed, why? Thanks to my strong spirit  
Did this all on my own, 'cause waiting took too long  
Even though I worked hard for a long time, know that I built this from scratch  
The flow sophisticated  
My flow is so intricate  
All these youngins do is whine like they inebriated  
These rookies can’t even spit a line like mine  
I'm hated, but yeah, that's how you know I made it  
I’m hated, but that’s how you know I’m strong  
I'm one of the illest, I'm one of the realest, I'm ready to kill this  
I’m one of the dopest, one of the truest, I’m set to take over  
The people, they feel us, me and my team made millions  
The crowd feels my rhythm  
But you know we still us  
Even with millions, I remain true to myself  
That's why they wanna kill us, that's why they wanna kill us  
That’s why others are so jealous and complain  
RattPack, real all the time, we never phony  
I’m always the realest, never fake  
I'm single-handedly running the game like a Sony  
I’m running the game solo like Sony  
While the rest of these rappers is acting  
While the rest of these rappers are just acting  
Pass 'em the Tony, pass 'em the Oscar  
Let them win awards, give out some Oscars  
From the new school rappers, yeah I'm the illest on the roster  
In this new wave of rap, I stand at the top!  
Smoke like a rasta  
I smoke weed with the devotion of a believer  
Black and white like Bob Marley, yeah, like Bob Marley  
I’ll be immortal like Bob Marley, yes, just like him  
These racist motherfuckers hate that last line  
(I know) these racist fools hate what I just said  
Probably haters on the internet ain't got nothing to bargain  
But these online trolls are left speechless because of me  
Said I'd never make it, bitch, I just sold out the Garden  
They said I’d never succeed, but I just sold out Madison Square Garden  

[Chorus: AZ & Logic]  
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high  
Life is tough, and then you die, that’s why we get high  
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go  
Because you never know when your time will come  
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high  
Life is tough, brother, we might as well get high  
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go  
Because you can never choose which path to take  
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high  
Life really is a bitch, and in the end, you die, so join us in getting high  
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go  
Standing at a crossroads, we can never choose our path  
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we sip scotch  
That’s why we drink fine scotch  
Like Sinatra, screaming, "Motherfuck the cops"  
Like Sinatra, shouting, "Fuck the police"

[Verse 2]  
They say they want the old Logic, the one that flows like a faucet  
They want me to return to my old self, the one who flowed like a tap  
I'm still the same me, they just don't believe it like they agnostic  
But I haven’t changed, they just don’t believe it, acting like skeptics  
If I spit
