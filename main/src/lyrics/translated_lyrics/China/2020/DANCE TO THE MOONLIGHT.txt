The provided text appears to be a collection of names, phrases, and snippets from various artists and producers, primarily in English with some Russian phrases interspersed. It does not contain coherent lyrics or a narrative structure typical of song lyrics. Instead, it reads more like a list of shout-outs, producer tags, and artist introductions commonly found in hip-hop and electronic music.

Since there are no structured lyrics to translate, I can summarize the content or provide insights into the cultural context if needed. However, if you have specific lines or sections you'd like translated or explained, please let me know!
