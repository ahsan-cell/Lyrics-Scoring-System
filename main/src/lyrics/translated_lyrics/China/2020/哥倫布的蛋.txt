**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Driftwood is a love letter written to me,  
A map where the golden branches lie.  
I was born to be a verb,  
Liking to take a different path and get lost.

**[Chorus]**  
Stretching out my lazy arms, I spread my five fingers,  
The universe is an egg, and we are Pangu.*  
Laughing, I pack everything into a bundle,  
Breaking my shell for myself, thus Pangu.

**[Verse 2]**  
Stepping onto the boundless ocean, dancing,  
With wild winds and giant waves, there’s no avoiding.  
Grapes have grown fangs, turning into wild boars,  
Dragging the sunken land from the sea floor.

**[Chorus]**  
(The giant and the prophet are his parents)  
The Earth is an egg, resting Columbus.  
(The parrot hatches slowly, quietly guarding)  
Columbus breaks out of the shell, taking big strides,  
Crossing the deep sea chasm to land.  
(The stones and tulips grow on his head)  
Climbing through the heavenly gap, traveling far and wide.  
(He’s foolish enough to believe the world is round.)

**[Transition]**  
Hmm  
The earth is round, the fire is round,  
The mountains are round, the sea is round,  
The wind is round, the core of the earth is round.

**[Chorus]**  
Even if I walk with a limp, I will keep moving,  
Even if I bang my head, I will ring the bell,  
Even if I live my days in the nude,  
(Fruits are round, harvesting is round.)  
Even if tomorrow the yellow flowers will fall,  
(The pen is round.)  
It’s better to see a cow play the lute and drink with pigs.

**[Outro]**  
Ooh  
(The stars’ ears are also round) Ooh  
Ooh (Look ahead)  
He says the heart is round, it is round.  
(Ooh)
