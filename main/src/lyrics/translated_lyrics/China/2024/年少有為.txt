**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The TV keeps flashing,  
I haven't deleted your contact yet.  
The kindness you showed me,  
I ended up ruining it by mistake.  
We once dreamed together,  
Of a place to sleep and eat.  
But how can we endure, living nights and days reversed,  
Not even able to gather the down payment?  
The wall panel, I smashed it,  
And it still hasn't been fixed.  
A bowl of hot porridge,  
You worry I won't have enough,  
So you leave half for me to take.  
Let me describe to you,  
A beautiful future, your eyes often turn red.  
Turns out you were heartbroken for me,  
But back then, I didn't understand.

[Chorus]  
If only I had been accomplished in my youth, not feeling inferior,  
Understanding what is truly precious.  
Those beautiful dreams,  
I never gave to you; I carry this guilt my whole life.  
If only I had been accomplished in my youth, knowing when to advance and retreat,  
I wouldn't have let you suffer for me.  
At the wedding, drink a few more cups,  
With the one you’re with now.

[Verse 2]  
We once dreamed together,  
Of a place to sleep and eat.  
But how can we endure, living nights and days reversed,  
Not even able to gather the down payment?  
The wall panel, I smashed it,  
And it still hasn't been fixed.  
A bowl of hot porridge,  
You worry I won't have enough,  
So you leave half for me to take.  
Let me describe to you,  
A beautiful future, your eyes often turn red.  
Turns out you were heartbroken for me,  
But back then, I didn't understand.

[Chorus]  
If only I had been accomplished in my youth, not feeling inferior,  
Understanding what is truly precious.  
Those beautiful dreams,  
I never gave to you; I carry this guilt my whole life.  
If only I had been accomplished in my youth, knowing when to advance and retreat,  
I wouldn't have let you suffer for me.  
At the wedding, drink a few more cups,  
With the one you’re with now.

[Chorus]  
If only I had been accomplished in my youth, not feeling inferior,  
Tasting the bitterness of regret.  
Money and status,  
I fought for them but wish I could turn back.  
If only I had been accomplished in my youth, knowing when to advance and retreat,  
I wouldn't have let you suffer for me.  
At the wedding, drink a few more cups,  
With the one you’re with now.

[Outro]  
At the wedding, drink a few more cups,  
Wishing I had been accomplished in my youth.
