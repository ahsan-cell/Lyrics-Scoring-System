**Translated Lyrics:**

Baby, take my hand  
I just want to be your husband  
'Cause I'm your Iron Man  
And I love you 3000  
Baby, take a chance  
'Cause I want this to be something  
Straight out of a Hollywood movie  

[Verse 1]  
Looking into your eyes  
Meeting once again  
There are words I want to say  
But I'm afraid I'll say the wrong thing  
Trying every way  
Worried about the awkwardness  
If I donâ€™t say it today, there may be no chance  

[Pre-Chorus]  
From the first time I saw you, I should have said  
That one day you would wear a wedding dress  
Traveling the world, holding your hand  
Looking at the moon, walking with you  
Telling you  

[Chorus]  
Baby, take my hand  
I just want to be your husband  
'Cause I'm your Iron Man  
And I love you 3000  
Baby, take a chance  
'Cause I want this to be something  
Straight out of a Hollywood movie  

[Verse 2]  
Holding your picture  
I always look at it a few more times  
Outside the window, the sky is dark  
Time is limited  
Hoping before dawn  
To share my wish  
Not buried in my heart, but tell you everything  

[Pre-Chorus]  
From the first time I saw you, I should have said  
Hoping one day you will wear a wedding dress  
Traveling the world, holding your hand  
Looking at the moon, walking with you  
Telling you  

[Chorus]  
Baby, take my hand  
I just want to be your husband  
'Cause I'm your Iron Man  
And I love you 3000  
Baby, take a chance  
'Cause I want this to be something  
Straight out of a Hollywood movie

[Chorus]  
Baby, take my hand  
I just want to be your husband  
'Cause I'm your Iron Man  
And I love you 3000

'Cause I want this to be something  
Straight out of a Hollywood movie
