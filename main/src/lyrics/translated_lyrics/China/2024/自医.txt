**Translated Lyrics: "Compendium of Materia Medica"**

If Hua Tuo were to return,  
All the foreign influences would be healed.  
Outsiders come to learn Chinese characters,  
Igniting my national consciousness.  

Semen strychnos,  
Cassia seeds,  
Xanthium fruit,  
And lotus seeds,  
Yellow medicine,  
Bitter beans,  
Chuan lian zi.  

I want face (to maintain dignity),  
In my own way,  
Rewriting a chapter of history.  
Nothing else matters,  
Just follow me,  
Recite a few words:  
Chinese yam,  
Angelica,  
Goji berries,  
Chinese yam,  
Angelica,  
Goji berries.  

Watch me grab a handful of herbs,  
Swallow down a dose of pride.  
My expression is relaxed,  
Dancing with ease,  
You can't learn this.  
Neon signs adjust my state,  
In this glamorous city,  
Waiting to wake up.  

My expression is relaxed,  
Dancing with ease,  
Using calligraphy to write dynasties,  
Inner strength spreads out,  
With bold strokes in regular script,  
Delivering a punchline,  
Lying flat for the conclusion,  
Let’s see who’s impressive.  

What elixir will you refine?  
What pills will you mold?  
Deer antler slices can’t be too thin,  
The master’s techniques shouldn’t be copied carelessly.  

Gui ling gao,  
Yunnan Baiyao,  
And cordyceps.  
My own music, my own medicine,  
Perfectly balanced.  
Listen to me say Chinese medicine is bitter,  
Plagiarism should be even more bitter.  
Quick, open the Compendium of Materia Medica,  
Read more good editions.  

Toad venom,  
Earthworms,  
Have crossed rivers and lakes,  
The hard work of our ancestors,  
We must not lose.  
This is the light,  
This is the light,  
Let’s sing together.  

(This is the light,  
This is the light.)  
Let me concoct a remedy,  
Specially treating your internal wounds from foreign admiration.  
Rooted in a thousand years of traditional Chinese medicine,  
With powers unknown to others.  

My expression is relaxed,  
Dancing with ease,  
You can't learn this.  
Neon signs adjust my state,  
In this glamorous city,  
Waiting to wake up.  

My expression is relaxed,  
Dancing with ease,  
Using calligraphy to write dynasties,  
Inner strength spreads out,  
With bold strokes in regular script,  
Delivering a punchline,  
Lying flat for the conclusion,  
Let’s see who’s impressive.  

Crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Again crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Light the lanterns in the alley,  
Again crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Digging into the radish pit,  
Again crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Chanting spells softly,  
Crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Again crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Light the lanterns in the alley,  
Again crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Digging into the radish pit,  
Again crouch,  
Little zombie crouch,  
Chanting spells softly.
