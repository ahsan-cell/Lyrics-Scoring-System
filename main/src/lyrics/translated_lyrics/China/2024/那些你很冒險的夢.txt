**Translated Lyrics:**

When your pupils learn to dodge,  
When love slowly gets covered, leaving only darkness,  
Distance stretches like a shadow.

When the story of love is just hearsay,  
I can't find your innocent face.  
When every moment of life revolves around you,  
The more my heart clings, the more it aches.

Those daring dreams of yours, I’ll go crazy with you,  
Paper airplanes caught in the rain will eventually fall.  
I speak the harsh truth directly, because love is heavy,  
But you refuse to understand, only walking the opposite way.

When the story of love is just hearsay,  
I can't find your innocent face.  
When every moment of life revolves around you,  
The more my heart clings, the more it aches.

Those daring dreams of yours, I’ll go crazy with you,  
Paper airplanes caught in the rain will eventually fall.  
I speak the harsh truth directly, because love is heavy,  
But you refuse to understand, only walking the opposite way.

I don’t want to let go of your released left hand,  
Your indulgence in love, while I can’t return to the sky.  
I’ve lost and I’m tired, when you no longer look back.  
You really don’t understand, my love has already landed.
