**Translated Lyrics:**

Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)  
Whatever you want, my Queen, I'm at your command  
Whatever you wanna do, you can have from me (oh, oh)  
Whatever you wish, I’ll fulfill your desires  
I want your love, just lead me on  
Longing for your love, playing with my heart  
Won’t give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey  
I won’t let go either  
'Cause I'm a sucker for you  
Just because you drive me crazy  
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang  
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang  

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]  
Uh, uh, yo, I got the money and the power now  
Now I have wealth and influence  
The G5’ll get me out there in an hour now  
A private jet will take me away in an hour  
The MAC movin' like crack, I'm sellin' powder now  
Working with MAC, my makeup's flying off the shelves, now I’m selling (white) powder too  
G-game over, locker room, hit them showers now  
Game's done, time to shower in the locker room  
I got the trophies and the catalogue  
Collecting trophies, picking up the catalog  
Just did a deal, Mercedes-Benz, just check the catalogue  
Just signed a big deal with Mercedes-Benz, check the ads for me  
I'm buyin' buildings, we don't buy the blogs (Kyuh)  
I buy buildings, never buy into gossip  
The Nicki challenge when I fly to Prague, uh  
Flying direct from London to Prague, that’s the Nicki challenge  

[Refrain: Labrinth]  
'Cause I’m a sucker for you  
Because you drive me crazy  
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang  
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang  

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]  
Uh, yo, who want it with Nicki now?  
Who wants to mess with Nicki now?  
I smoke ’em like hippies now  
I take them down like I would smoke a joint  
They see me, say, "Yippie," now  
They see me and cheer, "Yay!"  
Homes runnin' like Griffey now  
They’re running away from me like Griffey to home plate  
They switchin’ like sissies now  
Their attitudes change quickly, acting all soft  
You niggas is iffy now  
Are you guys a little confused?  
Bitches tune switchin' up  
The girls are turning their backs  
We take 'em to Jiffy now  
I show them what Jiffy is  
I'm thicker than peanut butter  
I’m richer than peanut butter  
He nuttin’ like Skippy now  
He’s shooting out like Skippy  
He want me to be his wife  
He wants me to be his wife  
His misses like sippy now, uh  
His wife is like a discarded pacifier  

[Chorus: Labrinth]  
Whatever you say, Mrs. Majesty (oh, oh)  
Whatever you want, my Queen, I'm at your command  
Whatever you wanna do, you can have from me (oh, oh)  
Whatever you wish, I’ll fulfill your desires  
I want your love, just lead me on  
Longing for your love, playing with my heart  
Won't give it up, hey, hey, hey, hey  
I won’t let go either  
'Cause I'm a sucker for you  
Just because you drive me crazy  
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang  
Boom shang-a-lang-a-lang  

[Post-Chorus: Eminem]  
She invites me to the condo  
She invites me over to her place  
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago (oh, oh)  
Uh-oh, but my wife is in Chicago  
My side piece, but she's also someone's wife  
My lover is also married  
So time we spend is borrowed  
So the time we have is borrowed  
But it's our moment, right here, fuck tomorrow  
But this is our moment, let’s not worry about tomorrow  
'Cause moments like these are to die for  
Experiences like this are priceless  
And she's clear all  
She’s innocent and sweet  
Nice and easy like hair when bleaching it blonde  
Smooth and easy like Clairo’s hair dye  
So we got that lightning in a bottle  
So we’re ready to show the world our spark  

[Verse 3: Eminem]  
She's tipsy, I'm sober  
She’s a bit drunk, I’m sober  
So she gets a chip on her shoulder  
So she’s feeling a bit moody  
Sits on the sofa, I go to load a  
She sits on the couch while I queue up a song  
Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on  
Playing
