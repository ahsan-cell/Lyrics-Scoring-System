### 2.1 Elopement

Mrs. Hu was so furious that she went mad, smashing everything in her house. The neighbors wanted to comfort her, but she refused to open the door no matter what. She buried herself under a thick blanket and cried for two days and nights before finally getting up to eat a pack of instant noodles. 

She was heartbroken because her husband had eloped with the young maid they hired. The neighbors rushed over to console Mrs. Hu, eagerly listening to her lamentations. 

“That shameless bastard! He forgets his own name as soon as he gets a little position. The older he gets, the more indecent he becomes. Two years ago, he was fooling around with a typist and had a child. He can’t resist a pretty young girl. That girl from the broken-down agency? He didn’t spare a single one! I never held it against him,” she wiped her tears.

“Do you think it’s easy for me? All these years, I’ve managed this household, inside and out, worrying about everything. If I miss one thing, it’s bound to cause trouble. It’s either the cat is sick, or the dog has a broken leg, or the fish is dead—there’s always something to worry about. To find a suitable maid, I pulled strings and asked acquaintances; I don’t know how many I’ve tried over the years, and none were satisfactory. Just when I finally found a good one, he took her away. Do you think he has any morals? There are plenty of loose women in the world; why did he have to steal her from me? That scoundrel, just wait and see, he won’t die a good death!” Mrs. Hu gritted her teeth.

“Your husband will come back,” the neighbors comforted in unison.

“It would be better if he died! I just can’t bear to part with that maid. She was such a good person; it took me years to find someone I liked. Can you blame me for being sad?” Mrs. Hu sobbed again.

“Mrs. Hu, don’t worry; don’t cry too hard,” everyone was concerned for her.

“If you want to help, please quickly find me another maid, preferably bring her back. My cats and dogs really like her. If she’s not here, these little treasures won’t even eat; look at them, they’re all so thin!” She cried even harder.

The neighbors all promised to help find her, knowing Mrs. Hu always kept her word and was willing to pay a high price this time. As for her husband—the former section chief—well, it would be better if he died! That’s what Mrs. Hu said.

### 17. The Helper

A major smuggling case in City F shocked the highest decision-making levels. The leader's directive was exceptionally severe, demanding that the discipline inspection department investigate thoroughly, regardless of who was involved or how powerful their position was, and to punish them severely.

A special task force was immediately established and quickly dispatched to City F. The first batch of discipline inspection cadres returned empty-handed, concluding that the reported situation was severely inconsistent with the facts. The smuggling case was deemed non-existent.

The second batch of discipline inspectors sent to City F conducted even more arduous and detailed work, taking longer, but the final investigation results were basically consistent with the previous conclusion. 

Reports from local residents and informants once again reached the decision-making level, providing substantial evidence that the personnel from the first two batches of the special task force had accepted benefits from local officials to varying degrees and had been corrupted. Thus, they had effectively become accomplices to the crime, acting as a protective umbrella for the implicated officials.

It was imperative to uncover the stubborn cover-up in City F; the determination from the highest levels remained unwavering. Therefore, after careful selection and rigorous testing, a third batch of officials was immediately dispatched to City F, vowing to reveal the truth behind the smuggling case.

The effects were very apparent. The “defenses” of the City F municipal committee, city government, customs, tax departments, and others were breached one by one. The scale of the smuggling case, its severity, its negative impact, the number of implicated officials, and their high ranks were shocking and would undoubtedly stun the entire nation.

Should the investigation continue? Yes! The attitude from above remained resolute. The special task force had been working tirelessly for over two months, almost around the clock.

Too many officials were involved; it was nearly impossible to find anyone unrelated to the matter. Some officials began to waver under the intense psychological pressure, and many voluntarily approached the special task force to confess, seeking leniency.

Wang Er, the deputy director of the Quality Inspection Bureau’s second division, after a fierce internal struggle, decided to seek relief as soon as possible. He
