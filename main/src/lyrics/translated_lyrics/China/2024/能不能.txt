If one does not teach, nature will change.  
The way of teaching values dedication.  
In ancient times, Mencius' mother chose a neighbor's place;  
When her son did not study, she cut the weaving thread.  

Dou Yanshan had righteous methods,  
Teaching his five sons, their names all renowned.  
To nurture without teaching is the father's fault;  
To teach without strictness is the teacher's laziness.  

If a child does not learn, it is not appropriate.  
If one does not learn when young, what is the use when old?  
Jade must be carved to become a tool;  
A person must learn to know righteousness.  

As a child, one should respect teachers and friends,  
Practicing etiquette and propriety.  
At nine, Xiang could warm the bed;  
Filial piety to parents is what one should hold dear.  

At four, Rong could share pears;  
Younger siblings should know to respect the elder.  
First comes filial piety and brotherly love,  
Then knowledge and culture, understanding numbers and letters.  

One leads to ten, ten leads to a hundred;  
A hundred leads to a thousand, a thousand leads to ten thousand.  
The three powers are heaven, earth, and humanity;  
The three lights are sun, moon, and stars.  

The three principles are loyalty between ruler and subject,  
Filial love between father and son, harmony between husband and wife.  
There are spring and summer, autumn and winter;  
These four seasons cycle endlessly.  

There are south and north, east and west;  
These four directions respond to the center.  
There are water, fire, wood, metal, and earth;  
These five elements originate from numbers.  

The ten stems range from Jia to Gui;  
The twelve branches from Zi to Hai.  
The Yellow Path is where the sun travels;  
The Equator is the central axis.  

Beneath the Equator, warmth is extreme;  
My China lies in the northeast.  
There are rivers like the Yangtze and Huai;  
These four waterways mark the flow of water.  

Mount Tai, Mount Hua, Mount Song, Mount Heng, and Mount Heng;  
These five mountains are known by name.  
There are scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants;  
These four classes are the foundation of the nation.  

There are benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust;  
These five constants must not be disrupted.  
The earth produces grass and trees;  
These plants are found in water and land.  

There are insects and fish, birds and beasts;  
These animals can fly away.  
Rice, millet, and beans, wheat, and sorghum;  
These six grains are what people eat.  

Horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, and pigs;  
These six livestock are what people raise.  
There are joy and anger, sorrow and fear;  
Love, hate, and desireâ€”these seven emotions are complete.  

Blue, red, yellow, black, and white;  
These five colors are recognized by the eye.  
Sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty;  
These five tastes are held in the mouth.  

Foul, burnt, fragrant, fishy, and rotten;  
These five smells are sensed by the nose.  
Gourd, clay, leather, wood, stone, and metal;  
Silk and bamboo make up the eight sounds.  

There are level, rising, departing, and entering tones;  
These four tones should be harmonized.  
From great-grandparents to parents and oneself;  
From oneself to children and grandchildren.  

From children to grandchildren, to great-grandchildren;  
This is the lineage of nine generations.  
Father and son share affection, husband and wife are harmonious;  
Brothers are friends, younger brothers are respectful.  

Elders and juniors have their order;  
Friends and companions are to be treated with care.  
Rulers should be respected, subjects should be loyal;  
These ten virtues are shared by all.  

When teaching, do not go against them.  
Cutting down on mourning attire, big or small;  
To the end of silk and hemp, the five garments conclude.  
Rituals, music, archery, charioteering, writing, and mathematics;  
The six arts of antiquity are no longer fully practiced.  

Only studying books is commonly followed;  
Once one knows characters, they should discuss literature.  
There are ancient texts, large and small seal scripts;  
Clerical and cursive scripts must not be confused.  

If one studies broadly, they
