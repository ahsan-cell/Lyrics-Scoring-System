**Translated Lyrics:**

Where does the wind come from, holding you in my arms?  
My heart starts to move, but it's lost its way,  
A little hole has been drilled through it,  
The moment we meet, it hurts, I must act composed.

We’re not good at letting others  
Break into the locked doors of our hearts,  
Then we start to hold on with our shells,  
Only you in the whole world know I'm deceiving myself.

We’re not good at letting others  
Call out nicknames and rush towards you,  
We have to put on a show, struggle a bit,  
Don’t expose the most deliberate passerby on this street.

The clouds aren’t moving, the clock isn’t ticking,  
Where does the wind come from, holding you in my arms?  
My heart starts to move, but it's lost its way,  
A little hole has been drilled through it,  
The moment we meet, it hurts, I must act composed.

We’re not good at letting others  
Break into the locked doors of our hearts,  
Then we start to hold on with our shells,  
Only you in the whole world know I'm deceiving myself.

We’re not good at letting others  
Hesitate and confirm with our last names,  
Do I really have to reciprocate and hold on?  
The whole world knows we’re both deceiving ourselves.

We’re not good at letting others  
Persuade us with kind words or question us with laughter,  
Someone always has to argue with reason,  
The most regrettable love in the world is called "us."
