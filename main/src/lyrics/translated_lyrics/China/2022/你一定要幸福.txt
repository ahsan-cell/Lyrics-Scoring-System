**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Pharaoh]  
Yo, Lanzi  
Right now I'm in a four-square-meter recording booth  
I’ve been so broke I haven’t eaten for four days, feels like hell  
The whole of 2012, not a single gig invite  
The ashtray piled high with over forty half-smoked cigarettes  
On the phone, it’s my parents’ nagging  
I think I’m a genius  
My songs should be in everyone’s headphones and on the radio  
Damn, why am I still so tired after sleeping twelve hours every day?  
Constantly soaking oats  
Just to fill this hungry belly  
I’ll listen to you, not cheapening my dreams  
And I won’t turn bad for money  
You hope that six years from now, I can drink to music  
Hope I won’t go on variety shows or talent hunts  
No need to bow and nod to anyone  
Bro, of course! I’m gonna make an extraordinary album, like the Eminem Show  
I will definitely achieve this  
Because six years from now, I’ll stay true to myself  
I won’t be a piggy bank  
My success will rely solely on my work  
Even if this market makes me feel sick  
Why should I listen to those idol singers’ works?  
I’ll keep my passion alive  
Bro, today’s my birthday  
I swear to Tupac, I will  
Make sure you hear my voice  
I’ll be waiting for you in the future  
I’m waiting for your applause  
You’ll be stunned by my lyrics like possessed by a ghost  
Want me to leave hardcore? Only if I’m dead  
You better take it seriously  
I can barely get up for takeout; I’m as broke as a living dead  
Not bad... walking  
Maybe I’ll start a label called Living Dead  
If I jump into the river now, will I find a door?  
Maybe this door leads to the future  
If the future me isn’t loyal to hip-hop, I’ll wake this loser up myself  
Hey guys  
Forget it, no point in saying more, you see for yourselves  
I need to finish my sixth mixtape quickly  
Hmm  
Lanzi, save this part for Pharaoh six years later  
If he’s still making music, he’ll become a superstar with this, no more worries  

[Chorus: Ice Paper]  
I’ve dreamed of this moment, this second  
Someone crashing down to the ground, drowned by a tsunami  
The powder on the table  
In the shadowy corners  
Continuing the sci-fi novel  

[Verse 2: Pharaoh]  
Dear Xiao Hu  
Not a single happy day in my 2020  
I feel like I’ve hit rock bottom  
Some say I’ve changed  
I feel a gap between us  
So do you think I’m still a qualified rapper?  
I’m always crying; do I even deserve to be a brother?  
You always say I shouldn’t care about those comments  
Honestly, I do care  
I really don’t want to be ruled by my emotions anymore  
Working under pressure for a whole year  
Can’t write anything, don’t dare to write, not like before  
I’m not a genius  
Why are so many people expecting me?  
Saying Pharaoh isn’t doing hardcore anymore  
That tone sounds like debt collectors  
So I stopped, and I regret it  
I didn’t make music to hear your criticism  
My struggle was never for a bigger share of profits  
I just want to bring my lyrics to a larger audience, even if it means relying on variety shows  
Why do they keep analyzing my true meaning?  
Maybe you all expect me to return to my old self  
But honestly, I think back then I was just one of many aimless rappers  
No characteristics, short-sighted, looking down on others  
Arrogance seems written in my genes  
I want hip-hop to earn everyone’s respect  
But this sense of responsibility weighs heavily on me every day  
Help me save this part for my future self, ****  
Why is there so much blame and cursing directed at me?  

[Chorus: Ice Paper]  
I’ve dreamed of this moment, this second  
Someone crashing down to the ground, drowned by a tsunami  
The powder on the table  
In the shadowy corners  
Continuing the sci-fi novel  

[Verse 3: Pharaoh]  
Hello, Longqi  
It’s been five years  
Maybe I’ve disappointed you  
Yes, I really can’t write songs anymore  
Even if I drink all the liquor on my nightstand  
Waking up in the hospital bed  
After healing, I have to face a world full of fake smiles  
Every day in this world is so torturous  
Nothing can make me happy  
I’m no longer a fighter  
I’m just a loser  
A typical failure in a career  
Thank you
