**Translated Lyrics: "Norwegian Wood" by Wu Bai & China Blue**

Let me take your heart away,  
And try to slowly melt it down.  
See if I still shine perfectly in your heart.

Do you still care for me, even a little?  
Do you still love me, unable to let go?  
Is there a place in your heart I've never reached?

Where the lake is always clear,  
Where the air is filled with peace,  
The bright white moon shines on the earth,  
Hiding memories you wish not to mention.

You said true love can always start anew,  
That real love can last forever.  
Why do your eyes still hold the loneliness of solitude?  
Am I just a refuge for you,  
Filling the gaps in your heart?  
When will that forest in your heart allow me to stay?

Perhaps I shouldn’t ask,  
Letting your calm heart ripple once more.  
But my love for you has crossed the line,  
I want to possess everything about you.  
I guess I shouldn’t ask,  
Shouldn’t make you revisit the past,  
But how can I break free from this heart's chains?
