**Translated Lyrics:**

I long to wield my sword across the world, yet I’m caught in chaos,  
Entangled in cause and consequence, waiting for someone to diagnose.  
With hidden arrows at my back, should I turn to see?  
When hearts harbor ghosts, the soul must pass through the "Gates of Hell."  

Long ago, lost in whose blood this robe has stained,  
On a narrow bridge, a lone figure stands, guarding the way.  
Revenge or curse, fate wraps around me tight,  
Pieces on the board fixed in place, endlessly turning in flight.  

Hatred and hatred, a cycle that never ends,  
In the depths of taverns, a touch of rouge divides light from dark.  
Counting the debts of blood from the ends of the earth,  
In the end, my thoughts are lost, merely a bystander.  

Right and wrong, entangled over three lifetimes,  
Looking back at the past, I bitterly fill my cup with wine.  
The moon was bright then, and still shines clear today,  
Only sighing as the world changes its gaze.  

**[Chorus]**  
Are you such a youth,  
Dreaming of returning to the past?  
Beneath the crescent moon, in a blue robe, I caress my long sword.  
When the wind rises, painting scrolls with blood,  
A three-inch blade can shake the mountains and rivers,  
With a flick of my sleeve, I roam freely between heaven and earth.  

**[Verse]**  
Moss green and speckled, time peels back the layers,  
With eager eyes, when will you send news from home?  
As I stroll, the courtyard’s drifting fluff turns into sorrow,  
When tears become a river, can I float like a wandering soul?  

In the courtyard, the crimson blooms gently scent the rain,  
Lightning flashes, the greenery sways in the wind.  
Silken strands fall from my fingertips, memories blur yet sharpen,  
That heroic figure hides behind a fluttering banner.  

Killing and killing, a cycle that flaunts itself,  
Blood stains slide down the spear tip, reflecting the night’s smallness.  
Under the city, red lotuses burst forth, illuminating,  
In the realms of heaven and hell, no more disturbances remain.  

The north wind howls, three lifetimes await,  
On ancient paths, thoughts are colored by time.  
The moon was bright then, and still shines clear today,  
Only sighing as a solitary figure gazes.  

**[Chorus]**  
Are you such a youth,  
Dreaming of returning to the past?  
In the north wind, iron armor cold, spear light chilling,  
One day, I’ll face three hundred battles,  
Time deceives, yet the mountains and rivers remain steadfast,  
To wander with her once more between heaven and earth.  

**[Chorus]**  
The storyteller may linger,  
But every tale must reach its end.  
The best of the dramatic moments is time.  

So let me close this scroll,  
Wishing those dream companions,  
When dreams awaken, still remain as youths.
