**English Translation:**

Keep it simple, just speak in a simpler way  
Please skip the emotions that build up  
You're not an actor,  
So don’t create those scenarios.  

No objections, I just want to see how you cover up your flaws,  
Your sadness is too surface-level, like an unskilled performer,  
The audience can see right through it.  

As for me, who should play along with your act, I pretend not to see,  
Don’t force the one who loves you most to improvise.  
When did we start to lose our boundaries?  
Going with the flow of the times, watching those clumsy performances.  

But you once loved me so deeply, why bother with the details?  
What should I become to delay the boredom?  
It turns out that when love lets down its guard, these things become the real test.  

No objections, do whatever you want, I’m indifferent,  
Your acting skills are limited, no need for speeches,  
Let’s keep the separation simple.  

As for me, who should play along with your act, I pretend not to see,  
Don’t force the one who loves you most to improvise.  
When did we start to have no boundaries?  
Following others' lies, being passive doesn’t make it less pitiful.  

But you once loved me so deeply, why bother with the details?  
What should I become to fit into this role?  
It turns out that when love lets down its guard, all these things have a deadline.  

Actually, the only audience here is me,  
I can see you’re a bit reluctant too.  
The scene has us accustomed to this back-and-forth struggle,  
Still worrying about what?  

Actually, saying we can’t part isn’t necessarily true,  
What relationships fear most is dragging on.  
The more we act out the heavy scenes, the less we can cry.  
Is it still worth it?  

As for me, who should play along with your act, I’m trying my best to perform,  
Like a guest on a talk show, chosen at will.  
If you can still see that I love you,  
Please cut out those plots, let me look dignified.  

But you once loved me so deeply, why bother with the details?  
The indifferent facade is my final performance.  
It’s because I love you that I choose to act, this kind of fulfillment.
