**Translated Lyrics:**

I exist because of the love from family and friends,  
Without you all, I’d be lost in despair.  
Life is a one-way street, no second chance,  
Carrying burdens is just part of the routine,  
Who hasn’t faced such struggles before?  
A glass of wine can easily be replaced by tea; I want to live life to the fullest.

No matter how fierce the storms may be, I’m not afraid,  
I’m already bald, so I don’t fear losing more hair.  
When troubles arise, don’t stay cooped up at home; everything will be alright, just keep moving forward.  
When you reach the bridge, the boat will naturally straighten out; even the waves will calm down.  
Keep a joyful heart, and you’ll see the power of persistence.  
Don’t forget, a real man isn’t afraid of hardship.

As long as you believe, there’s always a way to overcome problems; don’t give up easily.  
Trust that the heavens will arrange the best path for you, as long as you commit.  
Fools will find their own fortune, kindness will receive divine help.  
As long as you’re easy to get along with, blessings will come your way.  
Rest easy in the vast ocean of the future, in the land of dreams; uniqueness is an attitude.  
Because it’s you, it’s you, it’s you.  
Because of you, it’s you, it’s you.

When you have nothing left,  
Think about what you still possess.  
That’s your determination; that’s your everything.  
When you face failure and low times,  
You’ll know who your true friends are.  
True confidants don’t need to be many; no need to complicate things.  
No matter how submissive or fragile you once were,  
Don’t miss the moment of awakening.  
The courage of every era will redefine civilization.  
You can live with dignity; you can live with confidence.  
The paradise of the heart, a new direction, is waiting for you to embrace it.

As long as you believe, there’s always a way to overcome problems; don’t give up easily.  
Trust that the heavens will arrange the best path for you, as long as you commit.  
Fools will find their own fortune, kindness will receive divine help.  
As long as you’re easy to get along with, blessings will come your way.  
Rest easy in the vast ocean of the future, in the land of dreams; uniqueness is an attitude.  
Because it’s you, it’s you, it’s you.  
Because of you, it’s you, it’s you.  
It’s all because of you.
