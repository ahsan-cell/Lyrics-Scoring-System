**Translated Lyrics:**

It’s you who led me away from the party,  
Escaping the whispers and commotion of the world.  
Here, it’s just you, me, and the starry sky.  
When did you quietly come close to me?  
When did you secretly save me?  
In my palm, you placed a piece of candy.  

Why do humans love to gaze at the sky,  
Yet carry a pair of wounds on their backs?  
Born on this mortal planet,  
Do we not deserve to dream of being angels?  
You gave me your wings,  
Carried me through wolves and lenses,  
So I could taste a moment of freedom.  

Because of you, I fell in love with that sky,  
Underneath it, I pray that it’s you holding my hand.  
The deepest stories, the most eternal legends,  
Are simply you and me living an ordinary life.  

Life is but a fleeting moment,  
This world is merely a crevice between heaven and earth.  
Why must people live like demons,  
Trapped in the cage of right and wrong?  
It’s you who helped me stop the hourglass,  
It’s you who taught me not to fear making mistakes,  
It’s you who lets me live differently.  

Because of you, I fell in love with that sky,  
Underneath it, I pray that it’s you holding my hand.  
The deepest stories, the most eternal legends,  
Are simply you and me living an ordinary life.  

Because of you, I won’t back down,  
No longer wishing for regrets in this life, I won’t argue.  
I won’t listen to what others say, don’t care who understands,  
For no matter how vast the world is, it’s just you and me,  
Building a universe from the smallest memories.  

Because of you, I fell in love with that sky,  
Underneath it, I pray that it’s you holding my hand.  
The deepest stories, the most eternal legends,  
Are simply you and me living an ordinary life.  

Because of you, I won’t back down,  
No longer wishing for regrets in this life, I won’t argue.  
I won’t listen to what others say, don’t care who understands,  
For no matter how vast the world is, it’s just you and me,  
Building a universe from the smallest memories.
