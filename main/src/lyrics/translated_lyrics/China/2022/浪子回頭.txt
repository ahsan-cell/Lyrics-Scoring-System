**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
One by one, I light a cigarette,  
One by one, I down a drink.  
Please try to understand me,  
I can't hold my liquor, don’t push me to the brink.  
Time passes day by day,  
Sweat drips down, drop by drop.  
One day, we’ll all grow old,  
Let’s have fun together, as the prodigal returns.

[Verse]  
Dear and lovely,  
Handsome friend,  
Trashy and tasteless,  
Useless friend.

[Pre-Chorus]  
On this bumpy road, I ride my old motorcycle,  
No matter what, my life feels like a pile of crap.  
I have no money, no luck, just this one life,  
Oh friend, let’s fight together.

[Chorus]  
One by one, I light a cigarette,  
One by one, I down a drink.  
Please try to understand me,  
I can't hold my liquor, don’t push me to the brink.  
Time passes day by day,  
Sweat drips down, drop by drop.  
One day, we’ll all grow old,  
Let’s have fun together, as the prodigal returns.

[Bridge]  
On this bumpy road, I ride my old motorcycle,  
No matter what, my life feels like a pile of crap.  
I have no money, no luck, just this one life,  
Oh friend, let’s fight together.

[Chorus]  
One by one, I light a cigarette,  
One by one, I down a drink.  
Please try to understand me,  
I can't hold my liquor, don’t push me to the brink.  
Time passes day by day,  
Sweat drips down, drop by drop.  
One day, we’ll all grow old,  
Let’s have fun together.

[Outro]  
Let’s have fun together,  
Let’s have fun together, as the prodigal returns.
