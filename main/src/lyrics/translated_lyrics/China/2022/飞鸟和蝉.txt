**Translated Lyrics:**

Like little snowflakes falling on the coastline,  
One day in the fifth season unfolds,  
We have the time to meet.

You said an empty bottle is perfect for wishes,  
In a place warmed by the wind and moonlight,  
In the thirteenth month, you appeared as promised,  
The corner of the sea no longer feels far away.

You proudly fly far while I rest in summer,  
Silent declarations echo through many years,  
The longing at the northern latitude is blown away by the monsoon,  
Carrying away the whispered profile, carrying away the sung verses.

You proudly fly far while I linger on the leaves,  
Venturing into different worlds without ever saying goodbye,  
The memories of the vast sea and moon transform my yesterday,  
Yet you’ve never seen the smile that has matured on my face.

You said an empty bottle is perfect for wishes,

The corner of the sea no longer feels far away.

You proudly fly far while I rest in summer,  
Silent declarations echo through many years,  
The longing at the northern latitude is blown away by the monsoon,  
Carrying away the whispered profile, carrying away the sung verses.

You proudly fly far while I linger on the leaves,  
Venturing into different worlds without ever saying goodbye,  
The memories of the vast sea and moon transform my yesterday,  
Yet you’ve never seen the smile that has matured on my face.
