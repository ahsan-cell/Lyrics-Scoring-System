**Translated Lyrics:**

Time flows in the river of the moon,  
Endlessly cycling,  
Memories intertwine through past and present,  
Continuously meeting.

Slowly waking and drifting,  

In the blink of an eye, spring fades to autumn,  
Swallows find it hard to fly.  
Who can shoot down the stars with you?  
This life feels like a dream,  
Spinning countless times within.

Watching the falling flowers, silent,  
In the midst of wandering, another year returns,  
Counting the years as they pass,  
Yet still, we remain apart,  
Severing past ties,  
No regrets, no wishes,  
Dissolving the worldly thoughts of longing,  
Like before.

Listening to soft melodies, sleepless,  
Flowing half of a gentle heart,  
Watching over the years,  
Crossing over a thousand mountains,  
Through the smoke and haze,  
You will always stand by my side,  
Waiting for the tides to rise and fall.

As the smoke extinguishes the afterglow,  
Is it longing that calls out to me?  
A full cup of wine.

Slowly waking and drifting,  

In the blink of an eye, spring fades to autumn,  
Swallows find it hard to fly.  
Who can shoot down the stars with you?  
This life feels like a dream,  
Spinning countless times within.

Watching the falling flowers, silent,  
In the midst of wandering, another year returns,  
Counting the years as they pass,  
Yet still, we remain apart,  
Severing past ties,  
No regrets, no wishes,  
Dissolving the worldly thoughts of longing,  
Like before.

Listening to soft melodies, sleepless,  
Flowing half of a gentle heart,  
Watching over the years,  
Crossing over a thousand mountains,  
Through the smoke and haze,  
You will always stand by my side.

Watching the falling flowers, silent,  
In the midst of wandering, another year returns,  
Counting the years as they pass,  
Yet still, we remain apart,  
Severing past ties,  
No regrets, no wishes,  
Dissolving the worldly thoughts of longing,  
Like before.

Listening to soft melodies, sleepless,  
Flowing half of a gentle heart,  
Watching over the years,  
Crossing over a thousand mountains,  
Through the smoke and haze,  
You will always stand by my side.
