**Translated Lyrics:**

Trust your instincts, they've never changed  
The face from the beginning  
How many changes have been endured  
So much that can't be predicted  
Quietly crossing over  
Embracing the future, no matter how far  
Zooming in on each day  
Every moment must burn at its boiling point  

**[Chorus]**  
That we've got one life, one world  
So let's come together  
We'll weather the storm  
A rain of colors  
Look up to the sky  
We're all made of shooting stars  
We are made to love, woah  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
We are made to love, woah  
We are made to love, woah  
We are made to love  
We are made to love  

**[Verse 2]**  
Scattered colored pens, a blank canvas  
Still over there  
Then I would  
Oh, yes, I would, yeah  
Using a pen to draw the connection between reality and memories  
Then I would  
Trust me, I would  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
There have been moments that surpassed limits  
Experiencing my own changes  
The traces I've walked become light and electricity  
Life is small yet incredible  
Living, never giving up easily  

**[Chorus]**  
That we've got one life, one world  
So let's come together  
We'll weather the storm  
A rain of colors  
Look up to the sky  
We're all made of shooting stars  
We are made to love, woah  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
We are made to love, woah  
We are made to love (Love), woah  
We are made to love  
We are made to love  

**[Bridge]**  
[?]  

**[Chorus]**  
'Cause we've got one life, one world  
So let's come together  
We'll weather the storm  
A rain of colors  
Look up to the sky  
We're all made of shooting stars  
We are made to love, woah  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
We are made to love, woah  
We are made to love, woah  
We are made to love  
We are made to love
