**Translated Lyrics:**

If one day, I can go back to the past,  
Back to the original me, will you think I'm not bad?  
If one day, I'm far away from you,  
Can't meet with you anymore, do you realize I've already said goodbye?

When your eyes squint with a smile, when you drink cola, when you're noisy,  
I want to be good to you, but you never know, missing you, missing you, it becomes a habit.  
When you talk about today's troubles, when you say it's late and you can't sleep,  
I want to tell you, but I'm afraid I'll say it all wrong, I really like you, do you understand?

If one day, dreams come true,  
Memories become eternal, will you still remember today?  
If one day, we all realize,  
As it turns out, anything is possible, will we stay here?

When your eyes squint with a smile, when you drink cola, when you're noisy,  
I want to be good to you, but you never know, missing you, missing you, it becomes a habit.  
When you talk about today's troubles, when you say it's late and you can't sleep,  
I want to tell you, but I'm afraid I'll say it all wrong, I really like you, do you understand?

Maybe emptiness makes me think too much, maybe I should go back to bed,  
In my dreams, I will meet you, without hesitation, loudly saying what I want to say.  
When your eyes squint with a smile, when you drink cola, when you're noisy,  
I want to be good to you, but you never know, missing you, missing you, it becomes a habit.
