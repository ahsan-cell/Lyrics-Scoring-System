**Translated Lyrics:**

Meeting you was in a pure and beautiful world,  
But on that day of change, your tears flowed in exaggerated scenes,  
Enough to demand back from the world all that you gave.

Your story exists in a box that needs a password,  
Moments to remember, but when opened, it releases clouds of white smoke,  
Like a warning to myself, not to yield to longing for the past.  
The heavens change, the earth changes, and our love also changes.

And I, in this city, lost you,  
And in the process, lost myself.  
Thinking that in absurdity, there would be shortcuts,  
And I, in this city, lost you,  
Defeated by my own rising desires.  
It’s not you, nor an excessive love,  
But I love you, and love cannot support  
What I wish to possess, what I long to embrace,  
Thinking it could lead to an understanding's conclusion.
