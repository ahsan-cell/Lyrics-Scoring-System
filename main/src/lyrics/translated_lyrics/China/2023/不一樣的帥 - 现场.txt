**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
(SUP Music!)  
First of all, I don’t want to bring up the CDC, keep unrelated people out of this.  
I’m completely targeting the Higher Brothers.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Higher Brothers PSY.P Melo Ma Si Wei  
DZknow, and there’s one more I can’t be bothered to mention.  
Hahaha, ha, what the hell (hahaha).

[Chorus]  
Come on, come on, all of you come together.  
Watch me take on five, you five come at me together.  
I won’t sway to your songs anymore.  
Don’t get too cocky, let all of China sing along.  
One against five, one against five, one against five (Haier sister).  
One against five, one against five, one against five (Haier sister).  
One against five, one against five, one against five (Haier sister).  
Higher Brother? Higher Sisters!

[Verse 1]  
My chains, new gold watch made in China.  
Looks good on the surface, but it’s really fake inside.  
You’re flaunting receipts, what big talk do you want to make?  
Just because you can afford it now doesn’t mean you didn’t wear it in the MV.  
You shake like it, but it’s really just a facade.  
The trap you make is easy to follow along.  
You drop a few mixtapes, yet you still feel small.  
Your sister’s crispy, wants me to check out Ma Si Wei, right, babe?  
You might also like Ty.'s son, Xie Di's dog.  
Who’s Ty.'s son? Shit, Xie Di's dog.  
You’re Ty.'s son, Xie Di's dog.  
You’re all Ty.'s sons.

And PSY.P, you’re weak, everyone knows.  
Let you hit for five minutes first; I have a taste for violence.  
That guy from Shanghai who hit you, I want to give him a high five.  
I’ll be Wu Jing, coming to Chengdu to act in "SPL."  
Last time, you said sorry face-to-face, like I didn’t say anything.  
Didn’t say you were selling candy, you’re just pretending to be innocent.  
We’ve laid it all bare, let’s make money together, but you won’t listen.  
Your heart’s as tight as your pants; I can’t even fit in.  
So good, one against five, I’ll take them one by one.  
That day I went to Chengdu alone, booked a table at NASA.  
Oh, it wasn’t booked; the boss just gifted us drinks.  
Remember when I said, “What’s up?” and reached out my hand?  
You’re shaking it like it’s trap, but I’m the one dancing alone in the empty dance floor.  
Not you, DZ, still watching my moves.  
You’re in the VIP booth, faking the vibe.  
It’s so loud inside, chatting away, it’s all just fake high.

I want to stand up for my CSC brothers,  
Tell the whole world SUP is unbeatable.  
Ma Si Wei, your ex-girlfriend is loyal, accompanying me to see the Terracotta Warriors.  
Shout out to that girl, you don’t deserve her, do you understand?  
I’m registered in Changsha, feeling like a local.  
You from Pi County still dare to act so wild.  
Trust me, my brothers know more than just this.  
Gemini gossip can hit you right in the face.

[Skit]  
You want it?  
Yo, bro.  
I’ll be straight with you.  
Yiyang City.  
As long as you mess with the southern boys.  
Is it you, this southern boy, who’s tough, or me, this southern…  
Let’s see today.  
Is it you, this southern boy, who’s tough, or me, this southern boy who’s tough?  
Let’s see today.  
Is it you, this southern boy, who’s tough, or me, this southern boy who’s tough?

[Chorus]  
Come on, come on, all of you come together.  
Watch me take on five, you five come at me together.  
I won’t sway to your songs anymore.  
Don’t get too cocky, let all of China sing along.  
One against five, one against five, one against five (Haier sister).  
One against five, one against five, one against five (Haier sister).  
One against five, one against five, one against five (Haier sister).  
Higher Brother? Higher Sisters! (Ha)
