**Translated Lyrics:**

(yuh)

2023's restructuring indicators  
Mok Fa Chan witnesses three generations on stage  
The cypher from the 22nd Dog Show  
A mix of dozens of ideas with a single attitude  
Under Lion Rock in September 2021  
Youth gathered at M4  
From the initial street movements  
To M4's footprints gradually spreading out  

From Hong Kong to Kowloon, including the New Territories and outlying islands  
No matter how much is lacking, we keep filling the gaps  
The rise of a new generation is destined  
Flowing endlessly, expanding our territory  
Like a virus, we spread, robbing like Ye Jihua*  
All manpower, material resources, in our eyes, are gold  
Old man, what are you bragging about? We’re risking our lives  
You just have a mouth, but your life is at stake  
Talking about unbearable things is risking your life, but I refuse to fall  
So I spit it out  
Who’s on the mainstream now, acting like a fool?  
Who betrays the underground, just goes ahead  
To stab you in the back when you turn around  
They’re all envious every day, talking about resources, bowing down  
Not mentioning any deep-seated grudges  
Open wide and calculate when fortune will come  
Watch as M4 kills every cypher  
We hijack the emperor, commanding the lords  
You might also like, ink on the brush never stops  
Until the underground collapses  
Echoing through the seas, spreading far and wide  
Dust and sand, white and swirling  
Every challenge faced, we overcome  
Living under someone else's roof, but our roots remain  
Colonial exchanges,  
Next target is  
Britain  

[Verse 2: Autumn]  
Get that shit done, couple seconds  
A nice steak with some salt  
If the younger students are proud of me  
They won’t hesitate to take those old lyrics from the bottom of the warehouse  
There’s so much I haven’t dared to say, but my songs let my mama see it  
That one time I almost gave up was tough  
Three hundred bucks for food is enough for me to enjoy  
Half-believing, I’ve been coasting for four years, pouring my heart into this  
A few years ago, Autumn never thought I’d be doing this today  

How many black-hearted people gossip around you?  
Saved a few pounds of saliva for nonsense  
Same style, different solid skills  
Staying on the surface, inside is processed (shit)  
Just started doing it  
Starting to be somewhat useful  
Don’t make noise when I speak (shit)  
Working without paying the household expenses  
Black background reflecting red  
With a heart chasing dreams, shit  

[Verse 3: Bald Head]  
The Yangtze River flows for thousands of years, listen closely  
Don’t be scared, look behind, there are 170 soldiers  
In the name of the father, their schemes are treacherous  
Talking Hip-Hop with me feels like being next to 2Pac, so out of place  
Right, before anything’s done, I’m calm  
My character’s fiery, I open my collar, swag it  
Returning to the old school, limited edition for spring  
Every second feels like drawing cards in a gamble  
Seen the souls of money, not as easy to sell as yours  
Starting from the grassroots, now standing in the center  
Thoughtful reeds sway freely, how can they bend with the wind?  
Ain't no one can be me  
The light from the screen at 4 AM, thinking is my persistence  
When the first ray of sunlight breaks through the window, encouraging me to grip the pen  
I know these heartfelt words will resonate with what they lament  

[Verse 4: WanillaCoco]  
We back  
Haven’t seen each other for a long time, we haven’t changed much  
M-U-S-I-C colliding with aesthetic deviations  
Cursing the world, but no one gives a  
What we need to do is put the public’s gaze on us  
Who knows the rules  
But don’t face the truth  
We just gotta go to let them hear us  
They want to clear us  
But they need to know M4 youth stands firm and strong every day  
Behold, now fear us  
Checking my style  
You checking my vibe  
Shout for me now  
Yeah, I'm looking high  
Whether the sky turns dark or not, this place has its own light  
Concentrating, settling, merging, expanding  
Yeah, to make that one song  

We don’t care, write it down, no need for more boasting  
Why compare? Just listen, the industry is buzzing quietly  
The more twisted, the more I like it, so I’d rather be  
Juggling three jobs in a day but still made it to the magazine
