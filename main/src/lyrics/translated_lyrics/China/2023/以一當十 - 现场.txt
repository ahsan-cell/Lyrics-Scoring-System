**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Xie Di]  
Only rapper to rewrite history, without a pen  
Boss Xie on the track, let the story begin  
Everything comes from intuition, the real wooden floor  
Turns into a dream of being a rap star, yes we rap  
This isn’t the living room, it’s a modified Alpha  
No longer a cheap show in real estate  
This is the grand finale of the music festival, hola  
More followers, follow us  
More tickets, get more  
Matching the color of my red bandana  
I can see my account growing like Yao Ming's wingspan  
The capital of Chinese hip-hop, this is the place  
CDC Chengdu, the empire of hip-hop, we are the landlords  
Counting wealth while you’re just substitutes with no role to play  
You bitch ass suckers, it’s not just a close call  
Clowns like 69, we’ve been cooler than you since we were three  
Long necks and butts, dialects unclear, noses hiding secrets  
Here’s my self-introduction, hi, best rapper alive  

[Verse 2: Wang Yitai]  
We are the main characters, ignore how the script is written  
Chengdu group, get that million-dollar check  
Life is like a play, how to design the path?  
Always keep your head up, never mind how the camera captures  
Yesterday underground, today we conquer the mall with rap  
Parents are watching, so I don’t curse in my lyrics  
Which rapper wants to suffer? I’ll tie their veins into a Chinese knot  
The road is clear like the Chinese New Year, let the rap scene loosen up  
When the wind blows, we levitate  
Dandelions sowing seeds in the wind, find a better way and  
When they land, they can conquer the peak and ring the alarm  
All listeners, shout out, who are you waiting for, uh  
Shook ones, yeah, we make 'em shook ones  
Every time I perform, their skin gets goosebumps  
Can’t hide the strength like Kendrick squatting in a tree  
When we form a cypher, they can’t enter, Kings ain't dead  

[Verse 3: Melo]  
In this industry, I feel like a crane among chickens  
This circle is too young, filled with malicious criticism  
Hiding behind screens typing, so it’s distorted  
Rappers like copy machines, can’t escape the low level  
Huh, we’re the butchers on the beats  
In terms of seniority, we’re your grandpas or uncles  
Greed makes the heart swallow an elephant, it can only spit it out  
Little bro, hurry home and grab a taxi  
But to be honest  
Rap is really simple for me, incredibly easy to do it lonely  
Like eating, sleeping, drinking water, breathing air every day  
Like Jordan breaking statistical records  
Yeah, I play rap like it’s PS4  
A benchmark in the industry, 2K Online or EA Sports  
Sorry for making you rage hundreds of times  
You fantasize about being me but can only PS me on your phone  

[Verse 4: Psy.P]  
Not stopping until I reach my goal, moving forward  
I’m highly skilled, every word can become a classic  
This game isn’t played enough, if you want to surpass us, keep pushing  
So many people envy our wealth  
Holding chains and swinging them  
No matter where, we play better than the average person  
A row of champagne bottles on the table like a launch pad  
I don’t want to show off, but accidentally look cool again  
This must be fate’s arrangement  
Looks like you can only sigh  
I stand on the mountains watching this circle being renewed once again  
And we remain immortal, through the ages  
27 Club, how many couldn’t escape the curse  
My thoughts are too intricate for them to grasp  
I’ve held back too many curses, don’t force me to speak  
Never dreamed we’d become this wealthy  

[Verse 5: Li Erxin]  
Your posters are all torn down, our shows are packed  
Dad is eyeing a new car, asking if he can add a bit  
CDC is the black robe patrol, your biggest trouble  
Fake rappers wanting to eat, first come ask if they can get a bowl  
Separated, money is enough, together it forms the metaverse  
Look at those savage boys, provoking us, their resumes are almost immune  
All fall in the hip-hop boxing show  
Forget the roots, see 8 Mile  
Translating lines  
Got go, so much is incomprehensible  
Can listen but not intensely  
Online blah blah, thinking it’s child’s play, just call me on the telephone  
What I do is real, real  
One hand holding a car key in my pocket  
Sneaking
