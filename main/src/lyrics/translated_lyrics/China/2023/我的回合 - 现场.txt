**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Ma Si Wei]**  
Jewelry scattered everywhere, I wake up by the poolside  
Before heading out, I think, which car to drive today?  
Wish my brothers still fighting for their dreams a prosperous year  
Hit the jackpot but don’t take a dump, hurry up and get down here  
I took over, now you’re soft  
Mediocre folks, trashy ones, they don’t dare anymore  
I call a barber to come cut my hair  
I’m an NBA star, you pick up the ball for me  
Ten haters, nine want to be rappers  
I take over the game, you sit on the sidelines  
This music is too dope, bring me more  
Spouting nonsense, blew up your cypher  
This isn’t a gunshot, it’s the beat dropping  
The gap between us is huge, you can count it slowly  
After this round, your face will be full of holes  
You say you’re a rapper, but it’s all just a dream  

**[Verse 2: Deng Dian Guo]**  
Want to surpass us? You’d need ten more years to know you’re outclassed  
No words with you, if you want something, please take a ride on the three-ring road  
Your cyphers, we play them on our phones, clearly too much fuss  
Meet us once this year, and we’ll clean you up  
You should dodge a bit, I say you’re done, you’re done, you’re done  
Sucker rappers can hide now, the kings are back to patrol the hills  
Your little tricks have been seen through  
Leaving some marks on your psyche  
We look for tickets, you look for feelings  
It’s not that you lack talent, it’s that you’re lazy  
We’re a giant wave, drowning you  
Whole lotta Mayos, whole lotta gua  
No one plays better than us  
Heard you’re greater than us  
But in your cypher, you act like a stutterer  
Our rap is a controlled weapon  
Turning into your most painful experience  
Burn these trash first, then douse the flames  
I’m circling above your head, drifting around  

**[Verse 3: Li Er Xin]**  
What can money not buy?  
I have plenty, if you don’t like it, that’s rude  
My team has few rules  
To hype songs, fans reported me, damn  
He thinks this part is good, but it’s secretly led by us  
Never knew satisfaction, we’re sealed devils  
The world is cruel  
Dare to speak, dare to act  
Suck-ups rebut  
Imagining using bad flow  
To drive us away  
Cowardice, they’re cowardly, textbook flow igniting  
They act emotional, tears at the corners, hiding their laziness and weakness  
I bring shock, as big as a storm, the crown won’t reach you  
Occupying high ground, legs raised  
Trash talking, let’s talk reason  
Chinese rap represents us, pushing trash into the fire pit  
Overwhelming strength, you’re running naked, partying till morning  
Nothing is impossible  

**[Verse 4: Melo]**  
You don’t understand, different styles are like astronomy  
Keep your little plot of land and your lame questions  
You and your naive buddies are like salmon  
Restless souls send you a lullaby of dreams  
Yoo, for every enemy of mine  
I devour you like vegetables, and Fiji fruits  
You can’t escape every round you meet me  
Rip babe, writing you a beautiful song again  
When we show our fangs, you’re left with just fur  
This is what we call cypher, okay? My game is Battle Royale  
Run run run, friends, don’t look if I’m gone  
I go with the flow, we balling like OVO  

**[Verse 5: KnowKnow]**  
Baby CEO, shining under UV rays  
Representing Nanjing people  
Five-star higher help groups  
You guys aren’t bosses  
Oh, I’m the bridge for merchants to communicate  
You’re just pawns  
Sitting on a 360-degree spinning chair  
My company has multiple addresses  
With dollars withdrawn, stored in my domestic card  
Not stopping until I get a Bentley  
Now it’s my turn to shine  
With beautiful Panxi cheering for me  
Goodbye, I hit the gas, and you’re gone  
Opening a nightclub in Taikoo Li, Chengdu  
Friends who don’t comply can see it  
I don’t have a flashy background  
Babybo ICEPROUD in formation, Mr. Enjoy Da Money  
My trademark belongs to me  
Wu, not with you, R&B all night, today I want to rap  
I don’t have 350
