**Translated Lyrics:**

No matter the time,  
I’ve lived alone,  
Forgetting my fate,  
Yet here I am.  
Suddenly, in the light, I awaken,  
In the midnight hour.

Quietly standing at the exit,  
I strike the darkness with light.

In this day and age, do promises only bring anxiety?  
I just want to voice my wishes.  
I’ll introduce you to my family,  
I’m sure it will go well.

No matter the time,  
Always together,  
No matter the time,  
Because you’re by my side.  
The light that is you finds me,  
In the midnight hour.

Entering the noisy street,  
I’ll take off the mask of fate.  
Stop talking about meaningless things,  
Let’s eat something delicious today.  
The future is always ahead,  
Even I don’t understand it.

Don’t hold back,  
Do better,  
Just take it step by step,  
And it’ll be fine.  
The light that is you reflects my scenario.

Let’s talk more,  
About tomorrow that’s just around the corner.  
Turn off the TV,  
And just look at me.

No matter how well I do,  
I can’t believe it,  
Even in those times,  
Because you’re by my side.  
The light that is you finds me,  
In the midnight hour.

Let’s talk more,  
About tomorrow that’s just around the corner.  
Turn off the TV,  
And just look at me.
