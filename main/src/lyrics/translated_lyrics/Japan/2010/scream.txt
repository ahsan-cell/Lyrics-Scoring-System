**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The swaying illusion  
Like a lizard... I wonder  
Crying as if about to break  
Am I a dreamer? Uh, maybe...  
Whirling emotions oh intertwine  
Rain strikes like it's peeling my cheeks  
No way  
Repeating on the TV screen  
Reflecting monkey social dance  
As if guided, I simply  
Slipped into a dress  
Oh well... Is this a dream?  
A colorless party  
Endless paranoia?  
Taking my hand as if to invite  
"Shall we dance, again?"

[Chorus]  
I said "why?" I said "why!"  
My melting brain  
I said "why?"  
I want to escape from here  
I'm crying, silent screams  
A lonely scream  
Save me from this madness  
Of hallucination  

[Verse 2]  
The Ferris wheel spins in vain  
Looking up at a wax figure  
"Say, excuse me  
Now I don't know where I am"  
They said  
"Get on the suicide coaster!  
If you want to live"  
Struggling and struggling  
No way to getaway  

[Chorus]  
I said "How?" I said "how?"  
Escape from here  
I said "how?"  
In a world like this, I want to wake up  
I'm praying  
With a fierce scream that tears at me  
Help me! From this madness  
Of hallucination  

[Verse 3]  
Butterfly with red wings  
Flying in the sky  
Almost explode?  
Can't you wait a little longer?  
Smoking mosquito  
Scatterbrain  
Shout at the devil  
Can you hear me?  

[Chorus]  
I said "why?" I said "why!"  
My melting brain  
I said "why?"  
I want to escape from here  
I'm crying  
Silent screams, a lonely scream  
Save me from this madness  
Of hallucination  

[Verse 4]  
The swaying illusion  
Like a lizard...  
Crying as if about to break, am I a  
Dreamer?  
Crying as if about to break, dreamer  
Crying as if about to break, tripper  
Crying as if about to break, dreamer  
Crying as if about to break, screamer  
No future  
No further  
No future  
No religion
