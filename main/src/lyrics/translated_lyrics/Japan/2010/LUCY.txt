**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Keep going on  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Keep going on  
Hey!

[Verse 1]  
Baby, I'm standing alone  
On that unforgettable rainy day  
Chasing your shadow  
And it's over, like sand slipping away  
I sigh every night  
I scream like a child and cry  
Silently drifting in sorrow  
Please, please God, forgive my sins

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don't need to hide anymore  
Towards the shining blue  
Flowing on, keep going on

[Chorus]  
You've got the chance now  
You've got the power  
Realize so true to yourself  
I show you my life now  
I show you my love now  
I show you my everything, yeah-yeah  
Baby, don't be afraid

[Verse 2]  
Baby, I'm lying alone  
In these drowning days without awakening  
Endless is my misery  
Now I know not to look back  
Life goes round and round  
Just silence surrounding me  
Burned out like a phoenix  
And I'm falling, being taken away

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don't need to lie anymore  
Like the swaying waves  
Just live on, going on

[Chorus]  
You'd better change now  
You'd better catch now  
If you don't change, just be yourself  
I'll show you my strength now  
I'll show you my love now  
I'll show you my everything, yeah-yeah  
Baby, don't be afraid

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]  
You've got the chance now  
You've got the power  
Realize so true to yourself  
I show you my life now  
I show you my love now  
I show you my everything, yeah-yeah  
You'd better change now  
You'd better catch now  
If you don't change, just be yourself  
I'll show you my strength now  
I'll show you my love now  
I'll show you my everything, yeah-yeah  
Baby, don't be afraid

[Outro]  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Keep going on  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
Keep going on
