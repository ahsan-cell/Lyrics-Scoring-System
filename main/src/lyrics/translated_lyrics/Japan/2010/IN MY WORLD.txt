**Translated Lyrics:**

Unbearable sadness from the past  
It's alright, it doesn't even touch my heart  
With a blaster, I reached out my hand  
My life, I severed it  
As if gazing into the depths of the abyss  
Proof of existence, I can’t take it anymore  
I’ll protect my true self  

The path that seems impossible to cross has always been like this  
And then, no one was left...  

Curse fate, it’s worthless  
I can’t give up, I cry for pride  
Ah, ah, ah, alone in my world  
The song of love echoes  
In a distorted world, a twisted wish  
My ideals and tomorrow are crumbling away  
I was so bored I could throw it all away  
Goodbye, precious life  

A dark cloud in my heart is  
But light has shone on the path ahead  
Let’s fight, there’s nothing to fear  
I raised the dual-edged sword high  
My life, I’m not alone  
Guided by the voices of my friends  
Proof of existence, I can’t hold back anymore  
I’ve freed my true self  
The path that seems impossible to cross has always been like this  
My confusion has vanished...  

Curse fate, it’s worthless  
I’ll act recklessly, I try for pride  
Ah, ah, ah, alone in my world  
I can hear the song of love  
In a world that’s bent, I send my wish  
I crushed the doubts that held me back  
It was so precious I could throw it all away  
It’s my precious life  

Curse fate, it’s worthless  
I can’t give up, I cry for pride  
Ah, ah, ah, alone in my world  
The song of love echoes  
In a distorted world, a twisted wish  
My ideals and tomorrow are crumbling away  
I was so bored I could throw it all away  
Goodbye, precious life  

Rewrite fate,  
Becoming covered in scars, I try for pride  
Ah, ah, ah, alone in my world  
Yet still, I sing of love  
In a world that’s bent, I send my wish  
As bonds and tomorrow rise up  
Even if I throw it all away, in the end, it’s still precious  
It’s my precious life.
