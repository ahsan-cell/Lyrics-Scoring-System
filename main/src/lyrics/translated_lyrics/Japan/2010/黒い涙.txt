**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
On a night when I wished tomorrow wouldn’t come, countless  
Dreams and love lost, drenched in rain, I’m crying, crying, crying...

[Pre-Chorus]  
Living as I am, without any adornments,  
What do I need?  
Not even believing in myself, what should I trust?  
The answer is too close to see.

[Chorus]  
Black tears flow,  
What have I lost, it’s too sad,  
I can’t even put it into words,  
My whole body starts to ache,  
I can’t bear it, not alone.

[Verse 2]  
Crying through the night, exhausted, I drew a face that isn’t mine,  
Hiding my weakness, let’s stop making smiles, stop, stop, stop...

[Pre-Chorus]  
Living without adornments is the hardest thing in this world?  
If I were to receive something from you, I’d prefer something formless,  
I don’t need things that can break.

[Chorus]  
Black tears flow, even if I scream,  
Tomorrow comes with a blank face,  
Colliding with the same pain,  
If these days continue,  
I want to disappear far away,  
Even knowing it’s selfish.

[Bridge]  
Black tears flow,  
What have I lost, it’s too sad,  
I can’t even put it into words,  
My whole body starts to ache.

[Chorus]  
Black tears flow, even if I scream,  
Tomorrow comes with a blank face,  
Colliding with the same pain,  
If these days continue,  
I want to disappear far away,  
Even knowing it’s selfish.
