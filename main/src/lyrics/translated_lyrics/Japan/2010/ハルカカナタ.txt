**Translated Lyrics:**

Looking up at the dodecagon sky,  
In the -100°C glances that pass by,  
My frozen heart, hands tightly clenched,  
Glistening with sweat, burning bright.

In this sweet yet bitter concrete town,  

Far and wide, to the distant sky,  
Our voices can soar and fly,  
High, high, reaching far and wide, let them reach the sky.

In this city overflowing with egotist rules,  
Hands and feet bound by heavy chains,  
Yet we struggle, refusing to be dragged down,  
Continuing to fight against the pain.

Don’t kill your answer, please,  
I won’t pretend I can’t see.  
Don’t hide away the feelings you hold,  
Let them be free.

In this manipulated, distorted world,  
I’ll scream out loud, with my own voice unfurled.

Far and wide, our tomorrow awaits,  
No one knows, no one can erase,  
Believing in these deep, strong feelings that pierce through the haze.
