**Translated Lyrics:**

Open my mind  
Let’s go!  
Sweet dream on the other side  
Now I break free, out of the cage  

The rusty key  
The heartbeat that won’t stop  
I realized  
“I can’t go back anymore”  

The lost days  
(Hey baby, why?)  
Are connected in blue  
(I want to cry...)  
I don’t want to lose to my fear  
I won’t run from fate  
“I’m not alone”  

Even if you’re by my side, no matter how  
Sad the dream may be, it’s okay  
I want to touch your tears... baby  
I pray... “Believe”  
Cutting through the darkness of cold memories  

Wounded wings  
A spring to rest them  
I don’t know how to dive in  
You might also like a boring place  
Frustration and anxiety  
We still struggle today, but  

Looking up at the dark sky  
(Baby... for you)  
I move forward, lifting my face  
(I’m here for you)  

Packing my insatiable feelings  
Into my bag, I take a step  
Shaking off the darkness of my heart  

If the sound of the rain that scolds me makes me sad  
I’ll become your gentle shield  
Don’t stop believing always  
I pray... let those eyes  
Reflect a small miracle  

Ah... ah... ah... ah...  

(Hey baby, why?...  
I want to cry...  
Hey baby, why?  
Hey baby, why?...  
I want to cry...  
I’m here for you...  
Yeah...! Believe in yourself!)  
Even if you’re by my side, no matter how  
Sad the dream may be, it’s okay  
I want to live the same moment with you...  
I pray... “Answer me”  
If I’m allowed,  
I want to touch your tears... baby  
I pray... “Believe”  
Cutting through the darkness of cold memories
