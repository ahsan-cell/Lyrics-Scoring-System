**Translated Lyrics:**

The sea breeze rushes by the coast, illuminated  
Lost within a mirror of fantasy  

I tossed aside my timid key and dove in  
A panorama of love intertwining  

Passing through the marble door  
On a glass bed, we were like we used to be  
It feels like slow motion  
We were afraid of love, yeah baby  

Look straight at me, look at me  
Don’t turn away those eyes, my baby  
Teach me innocence in this empty room  
Since you left, lonely heart  
Please give me a ticket to return on Friday  
Sepia-toned memories  

I want to wait a little longer on this terrace  
Even if it turns into despair, I don’t mind  

Listening to the waves with a shell to my ear  
If I close my eyes to the sound of the sea  
Big tears sparkle as they fall  
When I’m alone looking at the ocean  
I feel like I’m all alone in the world  
It’s making me feel like I might break  
Yeah baby  

I can’t go home like this, need your love  
Even if the café latte on the table  
Cools down, my heart is a hot sandy beach  
Tell me, never again, show me love  
You won’t love me once again  

A photograph of tears dropped by the window  

Baby, I'm with my memory  
About you  
Baby, I'm with my memory  
About you  
Baby, I'm with my memory  
About you  
My baby baby  
Show me love once more  

On a glass bed, we were like we used to be  
It feels like slow motion  
We were afraid of love, yeah baby  

I can’t go home like this, need your love  
Even if the café latte on the table  
Cools down, my heart is a hot sandy beach  
Tell me, never again, show me love  
You won’t love me once again  
The sepia memories you left behind  

Look straight at me, look at me  
Don’t turn away those eyes, my baby  
Teach me innocence in this empty room  
Since you left, lonely heart  
Please give me a ticket to return on Friday  
Sepia-toned memories
