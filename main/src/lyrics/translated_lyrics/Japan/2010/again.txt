**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The continuation of my dreams,  
I thought I was chasing them,  
But I stumble on  
This winding, narrow path.

[Refrain]  
It's not that I want to go back  
To those days like before.  
I'm searching for the sky I've lost,  
I hope you understand me.  
Please stop with that sad face,  
As if I've become a sacrifice.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The end of sin isn’t just tears,  
I carry this pain endlessly.  
In this maze of emotions with no exit,  
Who am I waiting for?  
Just like I wrote in my white notebook,  
I want to express myself more honestly.  
What am I trying to escape from? This reality.

[Chorus]  
I’m living to make my dreams come true,  
In the middle of the night, I feel like I might forget.  
I can’t just play it safe anymore,  
There’s no place to return to.  
To erase these feelings,  
Life is still long, right? (I'm on the way)  
Even this nostalgic pain is welcome.

[Verse 2]  
I need to apologize,  
Yeah, I’m sorry.  
I couldn’t say it well,  
I left you worried all this time.

[Refrain]  
Everything I carried that day,  
Everything I’ll carry tomorrow,  
I won’t put them in order,  
I hope you understand me.  
I gently closed my eyes,  
Because even things I don’t want to see become clear.

[Pre-Chorus]  
About unnecessary rumors,  
Which is the first time I’ve heard this?  
If we meet twice, does that make us friends?  
Please stop with the lies.  
Like a red heart burning with irritation,  
It’s igniting inside me.  
Truthfully, I have expectations, this reality.

[Chorus]  
I’m living to make my dreams come true,  
I want to scream, can you hear me?  
I can’t just play it safe anymore,  
There’s no place to return to.  
I’m always grateful for kindness,  
So I want to be strong (I'm on the way).  
To move forward, both enemies and allies are welcome.

[Verse 3]  
How do I open the next door?  
I’m thinking about it.  
There’s no turning back now,  
The story has begun.  
Wake up, wake up.

[Bridge]  
To erase these feelings,  
Life is still long, right?  
There are things I haven’t finished,  
I want to try again,  
So let’s go once more.

[Chorus]  
I’m living to make my dreams come true,  
I want to scream, can you hear me?  
I can’t just play it safe anymore,  
There’s no place to return to.  
I’m always grateful for kindness,  
So I want to be strong (I'm on the way).  
Even this nostalgic pain is welcome.
