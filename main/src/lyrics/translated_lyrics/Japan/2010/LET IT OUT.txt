**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Let it all out, let it all out  
You don’t have to pretend to be strong  
Someone painted  
Flowers on the wall, swaying gently  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No one really knows  
What it means to be yourself  
On this long, winding road  
We lose things and find them again  
There are days when loneliness hits suddenly  
And we end up crying  

[Chorus]  
Let’s turn our tears and pain into stars  
Let’s light a lamp to brighten tomorrow  
Even if we wander small, let’s create together  
Let’s search for stardust, for an eternity that shines bright  

[Verse 2]  
Let it all out, let it all out  
There’s so much that feels lacking, isn’t there?  
It’s okay to be incomplete  
That’s why I met you, oh-oh  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I wanted to know  
What “certainty” really is  
I hid a small knife in my sock  
The lies I told to seem strong  
Hurt so much more  

[Chorus]  
Honestly, I’m scared, but I’ll keep living  
The wind brushes against your smiling face  
With our small hands raised, let’s create together  
Let’s search for stardust, for an eternity that shines bright  

[Bridge]  
What if what’s right is wrong?  
What should I do then?  
If sad things are right,  
Should I just accept them?  
I thought I had lost it all  
But you knew better  
I’m so glad you’re here, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  
(Oh-oh-ooh-whoa) Ah  
(Oh) Ah-ah-ah-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh  

[Chorus]  
Let’s turn our tears and pain into stars  
Let’s light a lamp to brighten tomorrow  
With our small hands raised, let’s create together  
Let’s search for stardust, for an eternity that shines bright  
Goodbye may come someday  
Seasons will still keep turning  
Even if we wander small  
I’ll walk with you, I’ll walk with you  
Let’s promise that won’t change.
