**Translated Lyrics:**

There was nothing left but a single dream,  
Echoing cries resound,  
Faintly reverberating deep within the forest.

The reason I held back my tears,  
Was the warmth of your fingers intertwined with mine.

A future without you,  
A future that holds no meaning,  
I won’t speak of it again,  
In the world I wish for with you,  
A world I've never seen,  
We journey far beyond time and space.

The voice of truth resonates,  
Swearing silently in my heart,  
There’s no turning back,  
Even amidst the storm, to the eternal paradise.

A soul unaware of destruction,  
Even if it’s destined to wander endlessly.

I want to run with you,  
To the ends of this world,  
I won’t look back again,  
With you, I can go,  
Running on infinite tracks,  
An unending dream will soon tell our tale.  

A future without you,  
A future that holds no meaning,  
I won’t speak of it again,  
In the world I wish for with you,  
A world I've never seen,  
We journey far beyond time and space.

We journey far beyond time and space.
