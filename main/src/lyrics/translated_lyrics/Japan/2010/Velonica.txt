**[Verse 1]**  
Amidst the setbacks, lost in trends, I sing pretending to be happy,  
Telling myself to run faster, recklessly, I quietly head into the wind.  
A glance back at the road I've traveled, no room for ease, surrounded by foes, one game after another.  
"With mountains and valleys and cliffs," the dust keeps piling up.  
In the midst of this endless journey, I stop by the edge of town,  
Gently stretching out my tired legs, as I lie down,  
I fall into a shallow sleep that repeats,  
Seeing that same profile over and over,  
Hearing those same words again and again...  
"Am I the only one who thinks just being alive is sad?"

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
The smoke from my cigarette swirls in the air, fading into emptiness,  
Surely still in those powerless, youthful days.

**[Chorus]**  
You've seen sadness that you shouldn't have to see,  
And now you're holding back tears that you don't need to hold.  
We can't live solely on the truth,  
We're not that strong, and it's okay not to be strong.  
Is that alright?

**[Verse 2]**  
As I lift my eyelids, the world is spring, parting the cherry blossom breeze,  
On my way to distant horizons, were you in this field of rapeseed?  
While I search the sky for the white flapping of birds,  
You must have listened to the earth, looking for the black footsteps of ants.  
Peeling off the mask like a clown,  
Standing on a hill forgotten by the sun.

**[Chorus]**  
Basking in the moonlight, I take a deep breath,  
In a world without the sound of breaking dishes or shouting voices.  
Even without warmth, we can keep living,  
But just living isn't enough for us.

**[Bridge]**  
The sprouting earth, the thick trunks, the vanishing rainbows, the passing days,  
The Spica in the night sky, the wonders of the seasons,  
Teach us, as we continue to seek the truth.

**[Chorus]**  
No matter how far we travel, the beginning of life is  
A single baby crying to be loved and to live.  
The reason we aim for somewhere that's not here  
Is to learn that the answer isn't somewhere in the heart.
