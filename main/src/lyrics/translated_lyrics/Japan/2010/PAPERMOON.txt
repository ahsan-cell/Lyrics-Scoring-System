**Translated Lyrics:**

I'M FALLING DOWN INTO MY SHADOW  
Holding my breath,  
Waiting in the DEADLY NIGHT.  

DON'T BE SCARED, the witch has drawn  
A pumpkin carriage,  
Reflecting in those eyes.  

SEE YOU IN YOUR DREAMS,  
YEAH BABY, even if it's a scary dream.  

FAIRY BLUE,  
I’ll break the stars for you,  
Adorning them,  
BLACK PAPER MOON.  
If you believe in me!  
WHEN YOU'RE LOST "HERE,"  
I AM... "FOREVER" WITH YOUR SOUL.  

When I look up, it shines like the moon.  

Sweet jam of deep crimson,  
Floating letters on a fallen card.  

YOUR DESTINY, if you wish for it,  
You can grasp any world  
In your hands.  

Don't be deceived,  
No one can scare you.  

FAIRY BLUE,  
The proof of life you gave me,  
An "eternity" called bond.  
If you shout for me,  
I WILL FIND YOU, MY DEAR!  
No matter where you are,  
I'll break free from the entangling curse.  

Even when no one can believe,  
There are times I feel weak,  
Yet still, your words  
Always echo in my heart.  

FAIRY BLUE,  
I’ll break the stars for you,  
Adorning the "mark."  
When you lose sight of your dreams and wander,  
I want you to look up.  
FAIRY BLUE,  
The proof of life you gave me,  
A "trust" called bond.  
You are not alone.  
WHEN YOU'RE LOST "HERE,"  
I AM... "FOREVER" WITH YOUR SOUL.  

If you believe, you will reach me.
