**Translated Lyrics:**

At midnight, I burst out,  
Kicking the door wide open,  
My glass slippers shattered,  
And my dress is torn apart.  

Hey, you must be astonished, right?  
Even if you chase after me, you won’t come,  
Tears overflow, and I can’t run anymore.  

It might be jealousy, it’s so painful!  

"Lonely in Gorgeous" Yeah,  
Party night, I'm breaking my heart,  
I want you to find me right now and hold me tight,  
The headlights are shining,  
Where are you, bad boy?  
Wipe away my tears with a love scarf,  
I can’t see anything.  

Gathering stardust,  
I want to throw it at you,  
Why do you care?  
You can only love yourself anyway.  
You might also like, is it heartbreak for real?!  

"Lonely in Gorgeous" Yeah,  
Party time, it’s unfillable,  
Without you, this world feels empty.  

I want to see the continuation of my dreams,  
"I miss you, bad boy,"  
Don’t trap me in the sparkle,  
I’ll break apart.  

"Lonely in Gorgeous,"  
I'm breaking my heart,  
Where are you, bad boy?  
"Lonely in Party night."  

"Lonely in Gorgeous,"  
I'm breaking my heart,  
I miss you, bad boy,  
"Lonely in Party time."  

"Lonely in Gorgeous" Yeah,  
Party night, I can’t smile,  
I don’t need anything, just stay by my side.  

"Lonely in Gorgeous" Yeah,  
Party night, I'm breaking my heart,  
In the box of sparkles you left behind,  
I hold onto loneliness and can’t move,  
I don’t need anything, just stay by my side,  
Kneel down and look at me,  
Swear your love to me.
