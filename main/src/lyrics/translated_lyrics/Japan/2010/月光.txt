**Translated Lyrics:**

I am GOD'S CHILD  
Cast down into this corrupted world  
How do I live on such a field?  
I wasn't born for something like this  

Footsteps buried in the gusts of wind  
As I feel myself about to fall  
These chains won’t allow it  

With my heart still open wide  
Only your sensations scatter around  
I still can’t manage to tidy them up well  

I am GOD'S CHILD  
Cast down into this corrupted world  
How do I live on such a field?  
I wasn't born for something like this  

Keep talking about "reasons"  
Until I can finally sleep  

There are only ineffective medicines lying around  
Even though there’s no voice here  
What on earth should I believe?  

Sad sounds leave scratches on my back  
I can't hang on to this world  
With feelings like this  
There’s no place for me anywhere  

Unpleasantly cold walls  
Which one will I allow my weakness next?  

Don’t reach out for the end  
If it’s you, then save me  

From this silence  

Time accelerates the pain  

I am GOD'S CHILD  
Cast down into this corrupted world  
How do I live on such a field?  
I wasn't born for something like this  

I am GOD'S CHILD  
Sad sounds leave scratches on my back  
I can't hang on to this world  
With feelings like this  
There’s no place for me anywhere  
How do I live on such a field?
