**Goodbye Crawl**

Goodbye crawl,  
The blue sea sparkles,  
Your sun-kissed shoulders  
Part the waves.  
Goodbye crawl,  
Even though I love you so,  
You don’t understand  
The feelings of the sandy shore—  
Such summer cruelty.

An orange round buoy floats,  
I wish you’d take me  
To the swimming ban rope, but it’s impossible,  
I can’t swim like you do…

Wrapped in a towel,  
I was a bit sulky,  
Wanting to monopolize  
The season of the sun.

A bittersweet crawl,  
I feel like crying somehow…  
I want to chase after you,  
No matter how far…  
A bittersweet crawl,  
A secret longing,  
Watching the swim club practice  
Through the chain-link fence,  
The thrill of jumping.

It’s not like the school pool,  
The vast ocean of adults,  
Freedom is always too wide,  
I can’t move forward in romance.

You remain  
The same boy from that day,  
Always competing with someone,  
Where are you swimming towards?

Goodbye crawl,  
The blue sea sparkles,  
Your sun-kissed shoulders  
Part the waves.  
Goodbye crawl,  
Even though I love you so,  
You don’t understand  
The feelings of the sandy shore—  
Such summer cruelty.

Memory crawl,  
As summer passes,  
The marks of my bare skin  
Fade away.  
Memory crawl,  
No matter how much I love,  
My dreaming heart  
Lacks the oxygen—  
The breath of love,  
You don’t understand,  
You don’t notice,  
The wind carries my sighs.
