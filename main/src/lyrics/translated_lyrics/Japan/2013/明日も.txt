**Translated Lyrics:**

One, two, three, and four  
Count what you have now  
Don't count what you don't have  

**[Chorus]**  
Count what you have now  
Don't count what you don't have  
Realize that you have so much  

**[Verse 1]**  
I’ve been pushing myself too hard  
And suddenly I found myself in tears  
In the bathroom at midnight  
I feel like happiness, which I've never held,  
Is somewhere out there—  
Is my impatience just because of my age?  

**[Verse 2]**  
I've lived happily on my own  
Not regretting a single thing,  
But like a foggy mirror,  
I can’t see tomorrow.  

**[Hook]**  
(Can't you see? Can't you see?)  
Freedom and loneliness come as a pair  
The more carefree I am, the more loneliness tags along  
(Don't you know? Don't you know?)  
If the grass next door looks greener,  
Just plant flowers in this garden.  

**[Chorus]**  
Count what you have now  
Don't count what you don't have  
Realize that you have so much  

**[Verse 4]**  
While longing for what I don’t have,  
Everyone is lost in life.  
Even as adults,  
Just noticing the beautiful flowers blooming at our feet  
Can bring us joy someday.  

**[Verse 5]**  
If I can escape the maze of dilemmas  
That I hold deep in my heart,  
The day will come when I truly understand  
What really matters.  

**[Hook]**  
(Can't you see? Can't you see?)  
No matter which path I choose,  
The same number of worries will follow me.  
(You can choose, you can choose)  
I decide my own priorities—  
What to keep  
And what to let go.  

**[Bridge]**  
(Can't you see? Can't you see?)  
The measure of happiness is a ruler  
That exists within my own heart.  

(You can find, you can find)  
Instead of counting what you lack,  
Try counting what you have!  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Count what you have now  
Don't count what you don't have  

**[Chorus]**  
Count what you have now  
Don't count what you don't have  
Realize that you have so much  

**[Outro]**  
Count what you have now  
Don't count what you don't have  
Realize that you have so much  
Realize that you have so much  
Realize that you have so much.
