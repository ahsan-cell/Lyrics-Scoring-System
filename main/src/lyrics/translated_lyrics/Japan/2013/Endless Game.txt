**Translated Lyrics:**

I feel like I'm about to break, just pushed along (Warning...) the moment I start to lose control.  
Awake through the night, facing morning in my head (Question) that voice, even if I cover my ears.  
Is it okay to stay like this, just as I am? (Warning...) it's all twisting inside me.  
If you know, then hold my hands (Answer) Yes, I close my eyes.

I'm dreaming a strange dream,  
A tiny, empty, distorted premonition that won't stop.

It's all impossible things, but I have to move forward.  
"It looks directly proportional, yet those feelings are inversely related."  
There’s so much I don’t understand, but there’s something I want to see.  
"A world without end, playing the game over and over."  
Where can I go? If I wish for it, it always starts anew from zero.  
Into a phase of all or nothing, even if I can never go back.

In other words, everything, all of it (Warning...) is just neglected.  
Before I knew it, I was swallowed up (Question) reflecting emptily within my shell.  
Even though you're so close by (Warning...) I pretend not to see.  
If you don’t want to know, then in your heart (Answer) No, it clings to me.

Drifting aimlessly,  
We’re shaken by love that feels unresponsive.

Let’s shed our sadness and face it head-on.  
"Neither lies nor truths, because it’s neither."  
It’s all such trivial things, but I want to believe.  
"A fading world, rewinding memory."  
What’s behind that door? Let’s open it, a reset connecting to reality.  
Even if the answer isn’t clear for the ending we should reach,  
Time passes without saying anything (Silence), still uncertain, keep moving forward.

It should always be there, something that doesn’t change.  
"What’s lost and what’s being born."  
This world isn’t just full of difficult things, right?  
"In your heart, it breathes, Endless."

Let’s shed our sadness and face it head-on.  
"Neither lies nor truths, because it’s neither."  
It’s all such trivial things, but I want to believe.  
"A fading world, rewinding memory."  
What’s behind that door? Let’s open it, a reset connecting to reality.  
Even if the answer isn’t clear for the ending we should reach.
