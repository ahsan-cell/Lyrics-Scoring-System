**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
Drawing my dream in the sky  
Because we can turn our wishes into the future  
Don't be afraid  
Ain't nobody can do it like me  
Shaking off the nightmare  
Shining more freely than anyone else  
No gravity  

[Verse 1]  
It feels like I can reach out and touch  
The horizon over land  
In a world without boundaries, I've seen countless dreams  

[Verse 2]  
But with each step into adulthood  
Gravity binds my heart  
Caught in the "rightness"  
Breaking free from this black hole  
Spreading my wings  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Tears and pain will become a song that shines through  
Connecting the dots, launching above the atmosphere  
I can't end here, of course, I'll spend all my life  
Shooting for the moon, nothing is impossible in zero gravity, let me fly  

[Chorus]  
Drawing my dream in the sky  
Because we can turn our wishes into the future  
Don't be afraid  
You know, you know, you know, no gravity  
Ain't nobody can do it like me  
Shaking off the nightmare  
Shining more freely than anyone else  
You know, you know, you know, no gravity  
No gravity  

[Verse 3]  
Stripes of light so bright they paint over the dawn's silence  
Shining rays as a farewell gift for a new journey  

[Verse 4]  
Rather than looking back to find answers  
Traveling towards the future without waiting for dawn  
Because there's a bond of fate  
Where we can clash our true selves  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every time I let go of what I've gained, I rise higher  
Now close your eyes and ascend with infinite images to the next phase  
Thereâ€™s no anxiety or fear; the story has no end  
Break free, wherever you are, let me take you and fly  

[Chorus]  
Drawing my dream in the sky  
Because we can turn our wishes into the future  
Don't be afraid  
You know, you know, you know, no gravity  
Ain't nobody can do it like me  
Shaking off the nightmare  
Shining more freely than anyone else  
You know, you know, you know, no gravity  
No gravity  

[Bridge]  
The initial impulse of the blue sun that swept through my chest still  
Accelerates and invites me towards the dreams ahead  

[Chorus]  
Drawing my dream in the sky  
Because we can turn our wishes into the future  
Don't be afraid  
You know, you know, you know, no gravity  
Ain't nobody can do it like me  
Shaking off the nightmare  
Shining more freely than anyone else  
You know, you know, you know, no gravity  
No gravity
