**Translated Lyrics:**

Beyond the time until yesterday,  
The feelings that should connect us,  
That bond I've pulled closer is ROCK PRIDE.

To love this world like this,  
I’m putting everything on the line now,  
I'm standing here now and forever.

As I try to envision a new future,  
Anxiety rushes in this way...

Don't you know, always,  
I’m imagining it—  
More than a beautiful future,  
It's so real, this world is  
Not as sweet as it seems.

Now I know, the thoughts of those before me  
Ignite this heart with passion.

Beyond the time until yesterday,  
The feelings that should connect us,  
That bond I've pulled closer is ROCK PRIDE.  
To love this world like this,  
I’m putting everything on the line now,  
I'm standing here now and forever.

Gathering the fragments of a past  
That crumbles away, piece by piece,  
Surely they are pieces leading to the future.

A path no one has walked,  
I’ll carve it out, and the story begins.

Beyond the time until yesterday,  
The feelings that should connect us,  
That bond I've pulled closer is ROCK PRIDE.

To love this world like this,  
I’ll burn this life away,  
You are my sunshine all the time.

To you, far away,  
The feelings I send are  
Certain and true.

In the gaps of time,  
Oh, life that was born,  
Shine bright...

Beyond the time until yesterday,  
The feelings that should connect us,  
That bond I've pulled closer is ROCK PRIDE.

To love this world like this,  
I’ll burn this life away,  
You are my sunshine all the time.

Beyond the time until yesterday...

To love this world like this...
