**Translated Lyrics:**

I wish I could just tell you I love you,  
But the fear of what’s ahead keeps me silent.  
My feelings of love, "I love you," swell and then fade away.

If I could have even one more second with you,  
It doesn’t have to be forever.  
The sound of my wishes mingles with the rainy sky.

A few days since we’ve been apart,  
In this pouring rain,  
On a day like this, I should have gone to get an umbrella first.

At our usual meeting spot,  
I wait for a shadow that shouldn’t be there.  
Without an umbrella, soaked to the skin, you were right there.

If I could warm my frozen hands once more,  
I’d want to go back to the beginning.  

I wish I could just tell you I love you,  
But the fear of what’s ahead keeps me silent...  
In this love that wavers between "I don’t love you" and "I love you," under the rainy sky.  

If I could have even one more second with you,  
It doesn’t have to be forever.  
Let me stay here until the rain stops.

Where will you be laughing tomorrow,  
The future I believed in?  
With no strength to let it all wash away,  
Time stands still, just as it was that day.  
Raindrops trace down your cheeks,  
Because of the unending rain,  
The sound of love sings...

I find myself envying couples walking by more often,  
When did being alone become so frightening?  
But right now, it’s a fleeting happiness,  
If only I could stay like this,  
I want to be just like those ordinary lovers.

What you wish for here,  
What I want to say here,  
Maybe our feelings can overlap now.

I wish I could just tell you I love you,  
But the fear of what’s ahead keeps me silent.  
I’m gazing at your profile,  
And that alone is enough.  
But even a handful of happiness,  
Is something you’ve given me,  
Honestly, I want to hold you tight forever.  
If only I could say that these misunderstandings are trials for us to start over again.

The fact that I love you has passed me by, and now I know I truly love you.  
After losing you for just a few days, I finally realized,  
I really want to confirm these feelings just as they are.

I wish I could just tell you I love you,  
But the fear of what’s ahead keeps me silent.  
My feelings of love, "I love you,"  
Swell and then fade away.

If I could have even one more second with you,  
It doesn’t have to be forever.  
The sound of my wishes mingles with the rainy sky.
