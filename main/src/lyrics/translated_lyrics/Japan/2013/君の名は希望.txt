**Translated Lyrics:**

Last June, when I changed into summer clothes  
Ignoring the ball that rolled my way  
It waited, looking at me  
Until I picked it up  

They called me an invisible man  
But you noticed my existence  

Light pierced through the thick clouds  
And on the ground, a shadow formed beneath me  
I had grown accustomed to loneliness over time  
But I rejected it—  
This world is beautiful  

I never imagined  
That I could long for someone this much  
The future is always  
A place for new thrills and encounters  
Now I know your name is "Hope"  

I watched you from a distance on purpose  
But sometimes, I lost sight of you  
With my heart empty for 24 hours  
I realized I couldn't live alone anymore  
It feels better than loneliness  
I felt happiness by love's side  

Even if I blend into the crowd  
No one will teach me the meaning of life  
As the rain of sorrow fell, I looked down  
And there, on the earth,  
I was surely present  

My heart aches so much  
Love really exists, doesn’t it?  
Even on this same sparkling day  
Our footprints continue on  
Now I know your name is "Hope"  

Even if you don’t turn around  
I won’t forget that smile  
I’ll believe that you’re always there  
And walk straight ahead  

I don’t understand anything  
Not even about myself  
Let’s listen to the cries of truth  
Come on  
I never imagined  
That I could long for someone this much  
The future is always  
A place for new thrills and encounters  
Now I know your name is "Hope"  
Hope is  
Tomorrow's sky  
WOW WOW WOW
