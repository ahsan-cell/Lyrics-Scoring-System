**Translated Lyrics:**

Vividly in love, ninja bang bang  
Somehow, ninja bang bang  
Bloom, bloom, bloom, petals dance  
Soaring high, ninja bang bang  
If I could change the common sense, it would astonish my everyday life  

Why, ninja bang bang  
I love you, ninja bang bang  
Ring, ring, ring, a melody that won’t play—  
Wrapped in gentle smoke  
What soars through the sky is nin nin nin  
Only because of you  

[Verse 1]  
What I saw was changing into seven colors  
When the time comes, you will surely  
Reach out your hand  
But it’s a light that can’t be touched  

[Chorus]  
Vividly in love, ninja bang bang  
Somehow, ninja bang bang  
Bloom, bloom, bloom, petals dance  
Soaring high, ninja bang bang  
If I could change the common sense, it would astonish my everyday life  

Why, ninja bang bang  
I love you, ninja bang bang  
Ring, ring, ring, a melody that won’t play—  
Wrapped in gentle smoke  
What soars through the sky is nin nin nin  
Only because of you  

[Verse 2]  
No matter what color you become  
You’ll paint the town  
Spreading out like  
A rolling scroll, creating  
A path ahead  

[Chorus]  
Vividly in love, ninja bang bang  
Somehow, ninja bang bang  
Bloom, bloom, bloom, petals dance  
Soaring high, ninja bang bang  
If I could change the common sense, it would astonish my everyday life  

Why, ninja bang bang  
I love you, ninja bang bang  
Ring, ring, ring, a melody that won’t play—  
Wrapped in gentle smoke  
What soars through the sky is nin nin nin  
Only because of you  
(Repeat x2)
