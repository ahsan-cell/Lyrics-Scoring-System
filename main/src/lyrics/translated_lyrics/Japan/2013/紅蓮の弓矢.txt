**Translated Lyrics:**

On that day, humanity remembered  
The fear that had them under control  
The humiliation of being trapped in a cage  
Release the bow, soar over the walls, fly to the sea!

[Intro]  
Are you the prey? No, we are the hunters!  
(Fire-red arrow and bow)  
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, we are the hunters)  
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, we are the hunters)

[Verse 1]  
Without knowing the name of the crushed flower  
The bird that fell to the ground waits for the wind  
Even if I pray, nothing will change  
To change the present, I must be ready to fight

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
Laughing pigs trample on the corpses, moving forward  
The "freedom" of the livestock is just a facade, a falsehood!

[Chorus 1]  
The humiliation of being trapped is the catalyst for revenge  
Beyond the ramparts, the hunter seeks its prey  
Burning with the impulse that erupts within  
In twilight, the crimson bow draws forth the light

[Post-Chorus]  
(Hah, we are the hunters)  
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, we are the hunters)

[Keyboard Solo]

[Verse 2]  
Those who chase the arrows will never let go  
Those who release the arrows will never escape  
A crane that seems about to snap from being pulled to its limit  
Will release its grip again and again until it survives

[Verse 3]  
Killing the prey is not about tools or techniques  
It’s your own murderous intent that has been sharpened

[Bridge]  
We are the hunters! Burning like flames  
We are the hunters! Cold as ice  
We are the hunters! Putting ourselves into the arrows  
We are the hunters! Piercing through everything

[Guitar Solo]

[Interlude]  
Attack on Titan  
The boy of yesteryear will soon grasp the sword  
Those who only lament their powerlessness can change nothing  
The boy of yesteryear will soon take up the black sword  
Hatred and anger are a double-edged blade  
Soon, one day, he will show fate his teeth

[Verse 4]  
To change something, you must be able to discard something  
You cannot carry any risks without letting go of something  
Nothing will come true while you remain burdened  
To change anything at all

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
The illusion of anguish, just a mere phantom, now has reckless courage  
"Freedom" is a race against the odds, let’s win against the chains!

[Chorus 2]  
The injustice that has been imposed is the catalyst for the advance  
Eren desires the stolen horizon, the "world"  
While being overwhelmed by the relentless impulse  
The bow of death carries forth the twilight

[Post-Chorus]  
(Hah, we are the hunters)  
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, we are the hunters)

[Outro]  
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, we are the hunters)  
(Hah, hah, hah, hah, hah, we are the hunters)
