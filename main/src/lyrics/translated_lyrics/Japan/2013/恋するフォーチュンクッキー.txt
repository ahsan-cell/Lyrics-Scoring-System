**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Mayu, Yuko, Rino]  
Even though I like you so much,  
You seem completely uninterested.  
Getting ready for yet another heartbreak,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah~

[Verse 2: Mariko, Yuki, Jurina]  
Looking around, there are so many  
Cute girls everywhere, you know?  
The plain flower goes unnoticed,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah~

[Pre-Chorus: Minami, Haruna, Rena, Tomomi, Haruka, Sae, Yui, Akari, Sayaka, Miyuki, Rino]  
Music flows through the cafeteria,  
As I listen absentmindedly,  
Before I know it, I’m moving to the rhythm,  
Starting from my toes.  
I can’t stop this feeling inside,  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby,  
Tell me my fortune.

[Chorus: All]  
Fortune cookie of love!  
The future isn’t so bad, you know?  
Hey, hey, hey~  
To bring in good luck,  
Just show a smile.  
Heart-shaped fortune cookie,  
Let’s make our fortune better than today,  
Hey, hey, hey~  
Hey, hey, hey~

[Post-Chorus: Mayu, Yuko, Rino, Mariko, Yuki, Minami, Haruna, Jurina, Rena, Sae, Tomomi, Haruka, Yui, Akari, Sayaka, Miyuki]  
Life isn’t something to throw away,  
A surprising miracle can happen.  
I have a feeling we’ll find love somewhere.

[Verse 3: Mariko, Yuki, Jurina, Minami, Haruna, Rena]  
I want to confess to you properly,  
But I lack confidence in myself.  
I can already imagine your reaction,  
Yeah, yeah, yeah~

[Pre-Chorus: Tomomi, Haruka, Sae, Yui, Akari, Sayaka, Miyuki, Mayu, Yuko, Rino, Rino]  
Boys say they want a nice girl,  
But looks always give an advantage.  
It’s always the cute ones  
Who win the popularity contest.  
Please! Please! Please! Oh baby,  
Look at me too.

[Chorus: All]  
Fortune cookie of love!  
Let’s break that shell open!  
Hey, hey, hey~  
The future’s twists and turns,  
Not even God knows.  
Tearful fortune cookie,  
Don’t be so negative,  
Hey, hey, hey~  
Hey, hey, hey~

[Post-Chorus: Mayu, Yuko, Rino, Mariko, Yuki, Minami, Haruna, Rena, Jurina, Sae, Tomomi, Haruka, Yui, Akari, Sayaka, Miyuki]  
The world is overflowing with love,  
It makes you forget sad events.  
I believe tomorrow will bring its own winds.

[Pre-Chorus: Mayu, Yuko, Rino]  
Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby,  
Tell me my fortune.

[Chorus: All]  
Fortune cookie of love!  
The future isn’t so bad, you know?  
Hey, hey, hey~  
To bring in good luck,  
Just show a smile.  
Heart-shaped fortune cookie,  
Let’s make our fortune better than today,  
Hey, hey, hey~  
Hey, hey, hey~

[Post-Chorus: Mayu, Yuko, Rino, Mariko, Yuki, Minami, Haruna, Rena, Jurina, Sae, Tomomi, Haruka, Yui, Akari, Sayaka, Miyuki]  
The world is overflowing with love,  
It makes you forget sad events.  
I believe tomorrow will bring its own winds.
