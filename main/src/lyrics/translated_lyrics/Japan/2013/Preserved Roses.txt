**Translated Lyrics:**

A flower that fades into eternity,  
Its falsehood brings such sorrow.  
I offer you the loneliness  
Of a life confined—Preserved Rose.

What overflows deep within this body  
Is merely transformed by others.  
Don’t let go of my fingers,  
When everything feels "too cold."

In both light and darkness, I can exist,  
So don’t be afraid; the morning you dread won’t come again.  
Only the vivid will repeat,  
Connected, at the end, you will once more…

Layering short dreams,  
A flower that fades into eternity,  
Its falsehood brings such sorrow,  
Wounding a world that rejects.

If you wish, I’ll make you see,  
So please don’t disappear far away.  
The tomorrow you envision,  
With its new breath,  
I’ll welcome it in my outstretched arms—never letting go.

Untouched, the heat melts away, love,  
Thoughts playing with desire.  
Doubting the smiles of creations,  
While trapped in sin.  
Before it gets tainted, I’ve decided to move forward,  
Eventually spilling, scattering like water, so bright.  
If I can reflect my heart,  
In exchange for a song that fades away.

Pouring in intense colors,  
Adorning an illusion,  
If you believe,  
Even the truth will surpass.

Stopping the flow of time,  
Not knowing how to decay,  
Those hands that bleed  
Offer you the loneliness  
Of a life confined—yearning for you.

Layering short dreams,  
A flower that fades into eternity,  
Its falsehood brings such sorrow,  
Wounding a world that rejects.

If you wish, I’ll make you see,  
So please don’t disappear far away.  
The tomorrow you envision,  
With its new breath,  
I’ll welcome it in my outstretched arms—never letting go.
