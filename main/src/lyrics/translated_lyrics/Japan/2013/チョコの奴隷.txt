**Translated Lyrics:**

The blue sky always seems so suggestive,  
Though spring is near, the wind is still cold.  

I’m watching from a corner of the classroom,  
Hiding in my bag  
The answer to this love…  

Just for today, I’m a slave to chocolate,  
Being tossed around, that’s me.  
If I could hear your feelings,  
I’d kneel right here and now.  
A little sweet (a little sweet),  
A little bittersweet day,  
Reach out your hand,  
A man cries out,  
“Queen, please give me your love.”  

The sun and affection are somewhat alike,  
Shining bright one moment, then cloudy the next.  

Is it just my imagination, or are you coming near?  
In your hand behind your back,  
Is an impossible miracle.  

Don’t tease me, don’t keep me waiting,  
If I can earn a reward,  
I’ll show you a single tear.  
Because I’m so happy (because I’m so happy),  
My long unrequited love,  
To all the lonely souls  
In the world,  
“Queen, please give me your love.”  

Valentine's Day is  
The final exam of love,  
My heart races,  
As everyday life  
Is being graded.  

Just for today, I’m a slave to chocolate,  
Being tossed around, that’s me.  
If I could hear your feelings,  
I’d kneel right here and now.  
A little sweet (a little sweet),  
A little bittersweet day,  
Reach out your hand,  
A man cries out,  
“Queen, please give me your love.”
