**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
There’s nothing to be afraid of,  
We’re no longer alone.

[Verse 1]  
On that night when something precious broke,  
I was walking alone, searching for stars.  
Did you see the Perseids too?  
I’m doing well, where are you now?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Don’t let the demon called "method"  
Possess you,  
Remember the important thing,  
The purpose we hold dear.

[Chorus]  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
There’s nothing to be afraid of,  
We’re no longer alone.  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
Even if it’s scary, it’s okay,  
We’re no longer alone.

[Verse 2]  
On that night when something precious broke,  
I was walking alone, searching for you.  
Since that day, we aim for the sea alone,  
Let’s promise to meet again at that place.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Don’t be misled by the demon called "society,"  
Remember the answer you decided for yourself.

[Chorus]  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
There’s nothing to be afraid of,  
We’re no longer alone.  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
Even if it’s scary, it’s okay,  
We’re no longer alone.

[Bridge]  
In this life, like a sparkle,  
I’m so glad to have met you.

[Post-Bridge]  
Once we leave the city and reach the sea,  
Where shall we head next?  
Let’s set out again,  
On this beloved Earth.

[Chorus]  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
There’s nothing to be afraid of,  
We’re no longer alone.  
The sky is clear and blue,  
Walking towards the sea,  
Even if it’s scary, it’s okay,  
We’re no longer alone.
