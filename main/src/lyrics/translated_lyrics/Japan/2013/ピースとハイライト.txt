**Translated Lyrics:**

Fight Club JP, everyone’s rapping so well, it’s the best  
Keep doing fun things like that, no rest  
I’m an MC from a generation above, you see  
But sadly, I’ve got a slightly different story to decree  
Dissing by name, beefs between who and who?  
To Japanese music fans, that’s just creepy too  
Is hip-hop still stuck in that old game?  

They’re giggling behind my back, what a shame  
So I’m here, trying to show I’m making music,  
Wanting to keep my distance, but it’s too much fun, I can’t refuse it,  
Sorry for jumping in, I just had to say,  
If we adopt American rules, we’ll drift away,  
From the Japanese music fans, more and more each day.  

For example, I want to rap like those at Summer Sonic,  
Captured on DSLR, that’s the kind of game I want to chronicle.  
But honestly, the music fans are to blame too,  
It’s like saying a punk band can’t play, that’s true!  
Understand it like pro wrestling, join in the play,  
It’s just a game, don’t take it so seriously, okay?  

My verses are like instant ramen, a clever invention,  
While everyone’s entering literary awards, I’m busy with comic conventions.  
Now let’s think about who we should really address,  
There’s not a single hater around me, I confess,  
I couldn’t muster the will to fight alongside,  
Maybe we don’t need a common enemy to abide.  

But without a goal, games lose their spark,  
If I call someone out, I might get hit hard,  
An MC who’s bad yet shows up regularly,  
And the media that glorifies this absurdity,  
The audience dances along, caught in the spree,  
Leaving only rappers worthy of respect, you see.  

A country where rappers rap to other rappers,  
What’s that? It’s just too lonely, it shatters.  
Most Japanese rap fans still can’t see,  
The vivid double meanings I weave,  
So I can’t truly feel inspired to write,  
The wall between hip-hop fans and Japanese rap fans is tight.  

If we don’t break it down, we’ll fade like enka,  
Is it because they don’t understand English, I wonder?  
Even Seiko-san’s lines end abruptly,  
While common folks think fast rapping is skillfully lofty.  
With comments praising good English pronunciation,  
Efforts to win battles for living proof’s admiration,  
Are impossible in this situation.  

Forming a three-piece band with shamisen, koto, and flute,  
Can we challenge the world’s rock scene, that’s the pursuit?  
Do people want Japanese rap on the world music shelf?  
That sounds interesting, but there’s a risk to oneself.  
I’m not saying chase trends, but it’s 2014,  
For now, Fight Club JP is just a Twitter scene.  

It seems like we’re talking hip-hop, but really,  
It’s just a net rap movement, oh so silly.  
Many hustlers and gangsters listening to this track,  
This hashtag is already last year’s act.  
Without a site to cover it all, it’s not fun,  
Editor-in-chief, we need to get this done.  

“Subdivision” sounds nice, but it’s just shrinkage,  
Riding this wave, young ones are making a big image!  
Let Sky High handle it, that’s the price we pay,  
Since Ken-chan, peers have gotten better every day.  
How’s it going, you washed-up legend MC?  
You’re working on your fourth to sell your third, you see?  

In an age where anyone can drop a CD,  
It’s funny to cling to physicality, don’t you agree?  
Even Mozart didn’t release an album, you know,  
As long as what he made was classic, let it flow.  
What matters is that everyone has fun,  
As long as we enjoy now, let’s get it done.  

Personally, I want to drag this topic out,  
Not Akro, Kojo, or Kenza 390, no doubt,  
But Utamaru! I want to hear his verse,  
About Japan and America’s hip-hop universe.  

Can you talk about that, bald guy?  
Hey bald guy, over there, don’t be shy!  
Sasaki Hageshiro, you’re the one,  
You’ll do the best job in this flow, bar none.  
Let’s all call him, it’s time to unite,  
Dirty Science and Pop Life follow hip-hop’s light.  

It wouldn
