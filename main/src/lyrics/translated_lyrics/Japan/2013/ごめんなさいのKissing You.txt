**Translated Lyrics:**

Believe me! There’s nothing to worry about

I’m sorry, it’s my fault
Oh my god, you’re angry, aren’t you?
Please! Just listen to me, darling

Do my words feel insufficient?
SOS, SOS, SOS, SOS
I’m reflecting on my mistakes
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, forgive me

Sorry for kissing you
It’s just a little feeling I can’t express
Ambiguous? But don’t stop!
Daring, stay with me, I love you

Sorry for asking for one more chance
If I don’t hurry, I might just cry
I miss you, I can’t stop!
This feeling is about to burst

Jump into my heart
I want you to scold me for being bad

Seeing you so angry, it’s a surprise, maybe the first time
It feels a bit fresh, my heart races
You might also like, your always smiling face
You forgave me for everything
This is an emergency, rescue me

When our eyes meet, do you feel that thrill?
SOS, SOS, SOS, SOS
More than words, it’s my utmost motion
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, forgive me

Sorry means I love you
I’ll cherish you even more
Reflecting… but don’t stop!
Daring, I need you right now

Sorry will change my life
I feel like I’m being reborn
Right now, wake up
The whole town is a paradise

Imagining fun things
Positive myself, let’s keep walking

I won’t repeat my mistakes
I won’t cloud your smile

Sorry for kissing you
A sign of my regret beyond words
Ambiguous? But don’t stop!
Daring, stay with me, I love you
Sorry for asking for one more chance
Please cheer up and look this way
I miss you, I can’t stop!
This feeling is about to burst
