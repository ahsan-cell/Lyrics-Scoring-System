**Translated Lyrics:**

Like a chaotic competition, I’ve grown accustomed  
To this daily life mistaken for peace  
On a rambling coaster, swaying back and forth  
What is it that I can’t lose sight of?  
Swallowed by the concept of equality and rationalism  
My heart feels like a mere anecdote  
I hate it, I love it, I have to speak up  
Like a doll, unchanged in its form  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Ah! As I walk through the town at night  
Sometimes it feels joyful, sometimes lonely  
Contrasts whirl around like a spinning cloth  
Becoming a song and rhythm  

**[Chorus]**  
Marmalade and sugar song, peanuts and bitter steps  
Sweet and bitter, my head is spinning  
Let’s keep the party going, aiming for the next generation  
It’ll be a night that surprises the whole world  
I feel like I’m caught in a joyful loop, reflecting  

**[Verse 2]**  
Caught in the logic of self-righteousness  
What will our music turn into?  
Look this way, don’t turn your back  
Though it won’t become logic  
You might also like  
**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Ah! After the festival’s music  
People burst into tears, still high on joy  
Maybe it’s the same, but if we put it into words  
The subtlety becomes clear  

**[Chorus]**  
Even at its peak, the sugar song brings happiness with bitter steps  
Reflecting the reasons for not dying there  
Even if I’m pushed, tomorrow will be fine  
If I could fulfill the weather forecast update in my mind  

**[Instrumental Break]**  

**[Bridge]**  
Someday, even if the competition stifles breath  
Someday, even if logic loses its meaning  
Just continuing to play and step is  
What proves us to be ourselves, Q.E.D.!  

**[Chorus]**  
Marmalade and sugar song, peanuts and bitter steps  
Reflecting the reasons for living there  
The distance to the north is something to be proud of  
Let’s keep surprising the whole world  
Marmalade and sugar song, peanuts and bitter steps  
Sweet and bitter, my head is spinning  
Let’s keep the party going, aiming for the next generation  
It’ll be a night that surprises the whole world  
I feel like I’m caught in a joyful loop, reflecting  
Goes on, one step forward, then another, and again one step forward  

**[Outro]**  
Woah-oh-ooh, one step forward, then another  
La-la-la, la-la-la-la  
We got happiness, phrases & melodies
