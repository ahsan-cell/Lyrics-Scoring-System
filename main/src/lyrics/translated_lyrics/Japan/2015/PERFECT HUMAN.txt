**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
He said the world isn’t always fair to everyone,  
He said in this life, there are absolute winners and losers.  
He said that the peak of those winners is himself, the Top of the world,  
In a world where he is law and order, it will soon vanish into war.

**[Refrain]**  
The time has come; he is the true ruler,  
Before him kneel the defeated.  
Words of gratitude are fired at him,  
Wise men, learned ones, spur him on.  
Are the people ready to worship?  
Do you want luck to elevate you?  
Come on, everyone, raise your hands to the heavens, and now pray!

**[Chorus]**  
Do not fear, do not tremble,  
Howl (Hey), raise your voice (Ho),  
Now offer your blood and soul,  
I'm a perfect human.  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
We live in Tokyo,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.  
We believe in a new God,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.

**[Verse 2]**  
The earth splits open, the sea splits open,  
Even that pretentious Moses splits open.  
Stop praising so much,  
Don’t bow down, hey Napoleon.  
If you’re a king, then rewrite history,  
He is indeed the Top of the world.  
A to the T to the S to the U,  
H to the I to the K to the O.

**[Refrain]**  
Let’s call out this blessed name,  
A TSU HI KO.  
Say genius! (Genius!) Truly a genius! (Genius!)  
Say genius! (Genius!) Truly a genius! (Genius!)  
Say genius! (Genius!) Shout it louder!

**[Chorus]**  
Do not fear, do not tremble,  
Howl (Hey), raise your voice (Ho),  
Now offer your blood and soul,  
I'm a perfect human.  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
We live in Tokyo,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.  
We believe in a new God,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.

**[Chorus]**  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
Na, ka, ta, nakata,  
I'm a perfect human.
