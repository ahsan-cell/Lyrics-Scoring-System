**Translated Lyrics:**

When I feel like I'm about to forget my dreams,  
Your tears remind me of why I’ve walked this path.  
You teach me again and again,  
What it was all for.  

In the second spring that hangs over the riverbank,  
I walked with a one-sided love breeze.  
Someday, I want to bloom side by side with you,  
On the same branch.  

Sometimes, you smile with those sorrowful eyes,  
Because there’s still a heart you can’t show me, isn’t there?  

So delicate, it seems ready to break,  
At the tip of this branch, your future is being born.  
Don’t cut away the days yet unseen,  
I want to protect you as you laugh now and look back.  

When you feel like your heart might break,  
If you lean on my shoulder,  
I’ll carry the heavy load I’ve been holding,  
With care and tenderness.  

In my tomorrow, you’re always there,  
Becoming the wind that calms any doubts.  
If I can keep loving you like this,  
It’s okay if my feelings remain unexpressed.  
Unbound and unresolved,  
In the depths of my heart, the rain knows me.  

So delicate, it seems ready to break,  
At the tip of this branch, your future is being born.  
Don’t cut away the days yet unseen,  
I want to protect you as you laugh now and look back.  
In the depths of my heart, the rain knows me,  
I want to hold you tight,  
Because I want to be by your side,  
Because I want to be by your side.
