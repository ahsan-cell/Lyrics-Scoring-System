**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  

[Verse 1]  
If it might hurt,  
If it could make things awkward,  
Ah-ah, maybe love  
Is something I should avoid.  
If it’s just to casually date  
Someone who treats me kindly,  
Ah-ah, then perhaps  
It’s better to be alone.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s embarrassing to look away,  
Nervous and unable to speak well,  
That’s impossible; I’m an adult,  
I want to live with style.  

[Chorus]  
'Cause, baby, you're my  
Number, number, number, number one  
And you're the  
Only, only, only, only one (Ooh, ooh-ooh)  
Your smile, your eyes, everything  
Makes my heart race.  
'Cause baby, you're my  
Number, number, number, number one  
And you're the  
Only, only, only, only one (Ooh, ooh-ooh)  
It’s a little scary even for me  
(I wanna be your number one)  
This feeling won’t stop.  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  

[Verse 2]  
If I can’t focus on work,  
If I can’t be myself,  
Ah-ah, then maybe  
I want to pretend I don’t care.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Not getting a reply to my message,  
I wonder what you’re doing right now?  
I shouldn’t worry; you’re busy,  
I want to live coolly.  

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, you're my  
Number, number, number, number one  
And you're the  
Only, only, only, only one (Ooh, ooh-ooh)  
I don’t understand your heart; everything  
Makes me frustrated.  
'Cause baby, you're my  
Number, number, number, number one  
And you're the  
Only, only, only, only one (Ooh, ooh-ooh)  
It’s a little scary even for me  
(I wanna be your number one)  
This feeling won’t stop.  

[Bridge]  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Confusion and pride, ah  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Slowly crumbling away,  
I hate it, I hate it, but I really like you.  
Is it okay to truly like you?  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
I wanna be your number one.  

[Chorus]  
'Cause baby, you're my (Oh, woah)  
Number, number, number, number one  
And you're the (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Only, only, only, only one (Ooh, ooh-ooh; number one)  
Your smile, your eyes, everything (Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Makes my heart race.  
'Cause baby, you're my (Oh, woah)  
Number, number, number, number one  
And you're the  
Only, only, only, only one (My only one)  
It’s a little scary even for me  
(I wanna be your number one; yeah, yeah)  
This feeling won’t stop.  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Woah)  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh, woah)  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (I wanna be your number one)  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  

[Outro]
