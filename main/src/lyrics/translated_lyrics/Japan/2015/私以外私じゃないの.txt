**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
I’m not just me, you know.

[Verse 1]  
With a face that can’t hide my sadness, I piled up the night,  
Today too, I stacked on this endless life.  
Every time I hope for a tomorrow that seems to be getting better,  
I’ve hidden today behind the facade of my siblings.  
Reflecting me blinks countless times,  
As my heart changes, I easily sway along.  
But in that moment when I unexpectedly closed my eyes,  
I thought, “It’s not so bad,” and grasped tomorrow.

[Chorus]  
I’m not just me, you know.  
It’s obvious, but still,  
So I sort out the feelings I can’t return,  
I want to keep living.  
Isn’t that normal?

[Verse 2]  
I heard someone’s voice breaking through the shell,  
But I should have been trapped inside; I’m no longer there.  
Try becoming me, hey,  
You want to try being me, right?  
With words that can’t find their voice, I’m engulfed in smoke.

[Pre-Chorus]  
It’s embarrassing, I can’t say it,  
But there are things only I can protect.  
If I peel away my skin and get tangled up,  
Surprisingly, it might not be so bad.

[Chorus]  
I’m not just me, you know.  
It’s obvious, but still,  
So I sort out the feelings I can’t return,  
I think I want to keep living.  
I’m not just me, you know.  
No one can change that.  
To make sure today doesn’t slip away,  
I cast my gaze toward tomorrow.

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]  
I’m not just me, you know.  
It seems like you’re the same way.  
Looks like no one can change, huh?  
Turning my back, I said it.  
So I’m no longer afraid.  
Waiting for the late night,  
I think I want to keep living while sorting out these feelings I can’t return.  
I took a deep breath.
