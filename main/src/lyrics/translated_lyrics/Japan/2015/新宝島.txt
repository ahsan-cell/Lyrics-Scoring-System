**Translated Lyrics:**

Continuing on, one after another, I pulled the line  
Sketching out the next destination, the next destination  
Treasure Island  

If I take you along like this  
Carefully, carefully, carefully I’ll draw  
With lines that sway and tremble  
Carefully, carefully, carefully I’ll draw  
That’s what I decided  

Next, and the next,  
That next one isn’t a destination yet  
Searching for the scenery of dreams  
Searching for the scenery  
Treasure Island  

If I take you along like this  
Carefully, carefully, carefully I’ll sing  
Even if it sways and trembles  
Carefully, carefully, carefully I’ll sing  
That’s what I had resolved  

I’ll take you along like this  
Carefully, carefully, carefully I’ll draw  
Even if it sways and trembles  
Carefully, carefully, carefully I’ll sing  
You might also like, I’ll take you along  
With lines that sway and tremble  
I’ll draw  
Your song
