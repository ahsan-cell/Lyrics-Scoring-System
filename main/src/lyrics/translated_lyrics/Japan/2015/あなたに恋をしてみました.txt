**Translated Lyrics:**

It feels like I can do anything, oh, the strength that wells up inside me  
Oh, that’s it, oh, that’s it, it’s the magic of love  

Why is it that so quickly  
You bring me to my destined one?  
Love is lacking in practice,  
God must be playing tricks on me  

Today I wore high heels,  
Dressed up, but I’m just spinning my wheels  
In a dire situation! Conversations aren’t flowing  

I tried falling in love with you  
From the very first day we met, something felt different  
I was feeling that thrill  
I’ve started to fall for you  
It feels like I can do anything, oh, the strength that wells up inside me  
Oh, that’s it, oh, that’s it, it’s the magic of love  

What should I do? I heard through the grapevine  
That your ex-girlfriend and I are complete opposites  
“I like the type of girl I fell for”  
I hear that often, so I’ll give it my all  

It’s strange  
Just a casual word from you  
Has me all twisted around  
I must be losing it; I don’t even feel like myself  

I tried falling in love with you  
I can’t focus on anything, this feeling is new  
It makes my heart race  
I’ve started to fall for you  
It’s a bit exhausting, but  
Oh, I hope it never fades away  
Oh, this is it, oh, this is it, it’s the magic of love  

I tried falling in love with you  
From the very first day we met, something felt different  
I was feeling that thrill  
I’ve started to fall for you  
It feels like I can do anything,  
Oh, the strength that wells up inside me  
Oh, that’s it, oh, that’s it, it’s the magic of love  
Oh, this is it, oh, this is it, it’s the magic of love
