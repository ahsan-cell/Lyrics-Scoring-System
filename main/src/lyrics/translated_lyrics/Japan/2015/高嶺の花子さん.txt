**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
To you, I’m surely just a friend of a friend,  
If that smile is meant for someone like acquaintance B,  
Then you must be a terrifying person.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t know the black magic to make you fall for me,  
And I lack the courage and the car to take you to the sea.  
But I want to see you waking up next to me,  
Smiling and saying good morning.

[Chorus]  
I want to see you, can’t you jump out from that corner right now?  
Taken away by the summer’s monster, come back to me somehow.  
Even if we were born under different stars,  
By chance and the power of summer magic,  
Couldn’t you become mine after all?

[Verse 2]  
The one who’ll be your lover is probably someone like a model,  
He’s surely older than you, with sun-kissed skin,  
A fan of Western music, he fits you well.

[Pre-Chorus]  
When you kiss, you’re on your tiptoes,  
You laugh as I stroke your head.  
No, I’m not winning at anything,  
Wait, who is that guy?

[Chorus]  
I want to see you, can’t you jump out from that corner right now?  
Taken away by the summer’s monster, come back to me somehow.  
Even if you’re interested in someone else,  
By chance and some abracadabra magic,  
Couldn’t you become mine?

[Bridge]  
Letting myself be swept away by the anxiety in my chest,  
If I run to you, it’s actually me who’s  
Caught up in a bad kind of summer magic,  
It’s too scary.  
Only the punchlines keep coming to mind,  
Under the midsummer sky, trembling,  
I think about you,  
What flavor of ice cream do you like best?

[Chorus]  
I want to see you, can’t you jump out from that corner right now?  
Taken away by the summer’s monster, come back to me somehow.  
Even if we were born under different stars,  
By chance and the power of summer magic,  
Couldn’t you become mine after all?
