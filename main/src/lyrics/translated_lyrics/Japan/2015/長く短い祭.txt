**Translated Lyrics:**

A meeting of eternity and fleeting moments,  
Let us not forget our summer days.

With bodies chilled in the wrong place,  
We release ourselves into the warmth of others, flowing and being swept away.  
When I think about it, we've come so far.

Life is never dull, you know,  
Especially youth, it passes in a flash.  
Tonight, everyone is a pioneer, this is just the beginning.

Each one adorned in their own attire,  
Unrestrained lives cloaked in makeup,  
We shall not hide; we are summer.

For some reason, my heart feels heavy,  
Wandering through the warmth of others, flowing and being swept away.  
When I think about it, we've come so far.

Eternity feels so indifferent,  
A mere pretense is just fine.  
At last, the feast is in full swing; this is the main event.

Each one choosing from all directions,  
The fierce scent of burning lives,  
We shall not be timid; we are summer.

What shall we do with this fleeting youth?  
If it continues like this, it can't end yet.  
In full bloom, vibrant colors, still at their peak.

Just like the grand drooping willow,  
Reviving the memories of a lifetime,  
We must not let go of our summer days.

What shall we do with this fleeting youth?  
If it continues like this, it can't end yet.  
In full bloom, vibrant colors, still at their peak.
