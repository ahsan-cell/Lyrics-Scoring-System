**Translated Lyrics:**

I’m not here, that era is gone  
Still, the two of us, carrying a few scars,  
Were searching for the continuation of our dreams.  

I thought it would color itself as I wished,  
But without finding any answers,  
Still, this world keeps spinning on.  

The summer you gave me, that miracle, I won’t forget,  
Oh, overflowing feelings hidden in that sunset.  
So, why...  
I was aware of it,  
True love, true love.  

In the gaps of time, the wind flows in,  
In that corner of the classroom,  
I was just captivated by your swaying bangs,  
I fell in love with you.  

Days felt like walking in the sky,  
It was so natural to have you by my side,  
The future always seemed that way, without a doubt.  

In the summer when you were there, I couldn’t express this feeling well,  
Oh, why do our two hearts drift apart?  
So, why...  
It doesn’t reach you.  
When I realized it was a trap of affection, it was too late,  
Twisted emotions wander, seeking light.  

Unfulfilled wishes left behind.  

The summer you gave me, that miracle, I won’t forget,  
Oh, overflowing feelings hidden in that sunset.  
So, why...  
I was aware of it,  
True love, true love.
