**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I wanna fly so high  
Yeah, I know my wings are dry  
They say, "If you raise your wings,"  
But beyond that lies indifference  
Those who can fly, and those who fall  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No one is watching  
No one pays attention  
Yet I keep on flying  
Carrying the words that hurt  
Because I want to deliver them  

[Chorus]  
Chasing after, hoping to reach  
We soar together, with all our hearts  
Questioning through the nights of lament  
Our hometown shines even brighter  

[Post-Chorus]  
Like a migratory bird, now I set out on my journey  
I’ll paint a story that doesn’t exist  
Just wait and see  

[Verse 2]  
I wanna fly so far  
Away with my guitar  
People sing, "You’re not alone"  
It’s not a mistake  
Nor is it just an ideal  
I just don’t want to live relying on others  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No one is listening  
No one pays attention  
Yet I keep on singing  
To make you, who’s been hurt,  
Smile again  

[Chorus]  
I’ll bring the tailwind to you  
We soar together, with all our hearts  
Carrying the weight of distant pasts  
I’ll take you into the future  

[Post-Chorus]  
Like a migratory bird, now we flock together  
Until the day we finish playing this grand quartet  

[Bridge]  
All this time we come and we grow  
Now it's time that we should go  
But we both know that this is for sure  
It's not the end of the world  
Well, see you one day  

[Chorus]  
Chasing after, hoping to reach  
We soar together, with all our hearts  
Questioning through the nights of lament  
The dawn begins to color us  

[Post-Chorus]  
Like a migratory bird, I’ll return someday  
To tell a story that doesn’t exist  
Until the day we meet again
