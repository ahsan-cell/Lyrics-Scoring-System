**Translated Lyrics:**

Goodbye, my beloved one  
We can never meet again, we won't meet again  
Though I decided so  
Why, oh why  
Can't I forget you?  
Even today, in the night sky  
I wish to see you.

Why did I end up  
Falling in love with you?  
From the moment we met,  
You captured my heart.  
I don’t know what’s so great about me,  
But you said,  
"I'll change to be what you desire."  
But that’s not what it was about.  
You said I couldn’t make you happy now,  
But just being by your side  
Was happiness enough—  
Just that alone.

Goodbye, my beloved one  
We can never meet again, we won't meet again  
Though I decided so  
Why, oh why  
Can't I forget you?  
Even today, in the night sky  
I wish to see you.

Why did I choose to part with you?  
From the moment we separated, I lost my heart.  
The warmth of our joined hands,  
Under the starry sky, just the two of us.  
Why do only the joyful memories  
Keep coming back to me?  
I wanted to be closer to you,  
I wanted to be your comfort.  
If my feelings could reach you,  
I’d want to go back to that day once more,  
To meet you again.

Are you laughing with someone else?  
Where are you spending your time now?  
Are you still being yourself?  
Can you be true to who you are?  
I’ve been tracing after you,  
Lost in the dead-end of each day,  
Unable to move forward.  
I’ve been thinking of you too,  
Tonight, just like back then,  
The time we spent together  
Keeps replaying in my mind.

Goodbye, my beloved one  
We can never meet again, we won't meet again  
Though I decided so  
Why, oh why  
Can't I forget you?  
Even today, in the night sky  
I wish to see you.
