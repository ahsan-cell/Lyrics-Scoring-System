**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Baby, as the fragile night breaks,  
The sky seems to clear.  
Ready, a stream flows across my cheek,  
The birds are singing.

[Pre-Chorus]  
It feels like something fun is about to happen,  
A fantasy bursts forth.

[Chorus]  
Let me hear your voice,  
Like it parts the clouds and lights up the world.  
Let me hear your voice,  
Through distant places and even in the rain,  
Everything goes just as I wish.  
Ah, ah

[Verse 2]  
Baby, change those colors,  
Get closer to the stars.  
Hey J, always alone,  
Singing and dancing.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Every time something sad happens,  
That snare drum snaps.

[Chorus]  
Let me hear your voice,  
Like it parts the clouds and lights up the world.  
Let me hear your voice,  
Through distant places and even in the rain,  
Everything is the same sun.

[Bridge]  
If prayers can reach,  
Stay in a peaceful place.  
Because we will end someday,  
Dance now,  
Right now.

[Chorus]  
Let me hear your voice,  
Like it parts the clouds and lights up the world.  
Let me hear your voice,  
Through distant places and even in the rain.  
Let me hear your song,  
Like it clears the skies and saves the world.  
Let me hear your song,  
Even in deep darkness or above the moon,  
Everything goes just as I wish.  
Ah, ah
