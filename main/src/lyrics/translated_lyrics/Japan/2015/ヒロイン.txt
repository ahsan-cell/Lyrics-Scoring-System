**Translated Lyrics:**

Do I not fit into your everyday life?  
Snow fell from the white sky.  
A sigh I let out, saying it’s fine,  
Lingering a bit, it faded away sadly.

Is it falling in your town too?  
Ah, right next to me now...

It’s you who smiles, saying the snow is beautiful,  
But it’s also you who seems happy saying it’s cold.  
As I almost stumble, I grasp your hand,  
And you look so joyful saying thank you—  
It’s all you that I love.

Before I knew it, everything around was painted white,  
I might forget the mess that was there.  
Thinking of sending a message saying, “It piled up surprisingly,”  
I put my phone in my pocket, unfinished.

Can I change into someone strong and kind,  
Someone who is liked?

It’s you who smiles, saying the snow is beautiful,  
But my heart aches at the answer I almost gave.  
Not knowing how to pass it or where to throw it away,  
I’m just scared of the scenery you see.  
You might also like: No matter what movie I watch,  
Or what novels or music I hear,  
It’s you I always overlap with that heroine.  
Even the distant places I want to visit,  
The night sky I want to see,  
I always picture it with you by my side.

The town I should be used to feels so strange,  
How foolish I am.

When the white snow falls in your town,  
Who do you want to meet?  
Who do you want to tell that the snow is beautiful?  
I, after all, I am...

It’s you who smiles, saying the snow is beautiful,  
But it’s also you who seems happy saying it’s cold.  
As I almost stumble, I grasp your hand,  
And you look so joyful saying thank you—  
It’s all you that I love.
