**Translated Lyrics:**

I have a romance  
It seems I've indulged a bit too much  

I looked at an open bottle of wine  
It feels like my heart has withered away  
A vague breeze has appeared,  
So I’m trying a little too hard to dress up nicely  

Ah, have I stretched too far?  
Ah, am I disliked again?  
While thinking about such things, I gaze at the stars  

I have a romance  
It seems I've indulged a bit too much  
I have a romance  
But I'm rushing through life, obsessed with death  

"Nothing will ever happen, because nothing exists,"  
I once sang that  
There are people who shed tears at the voice that comes from abroad,  
Speaking in a foreign tongue  

I have a romance  
It seems I've indulged a bit too much  
I have a romance  
But I'm rushing through life, obsessed with death  

Rather than being able to cry out of sadness,  
I'd prefer the kindness that comes after crossing a thorny path  
Always, always beautiful  
Believe me  
Someone unknown stole my sound  

I have a romance  
It seems I've indulged a bit too much  
I have a romance  
But I’ve lost my way  

I have a romance  
It seems I've indulged a bit too much  
I’ve always been afraid of indulgence  
I have a romance  
But I’m rushing through life, obsessed with death
