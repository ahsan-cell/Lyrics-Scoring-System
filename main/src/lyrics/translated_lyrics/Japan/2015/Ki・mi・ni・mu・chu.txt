**Translated Lyrics:**

Because of that guy  
Today is the worst again  
I keep complaining  
About things like this  

What a hopeless bad day  
Let’s take a little detour  
Sing karaoke  
And drink some beer to forget  

Oh, is happiness just about money?  
I feel like it’s not quite true, but  
I’d at least like to give that girl a present  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… yeah  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… Oh yeah  

At that guy’s house  
Everyone gathers around  
Let’s make some noise again  
Like we used to do  
You might also like getting scolded  
While reflecting on it  
Let’s reset  
And have another drink  

Aren’t we forgetting important things  
By spending too much time on social media?  
After all, we should toast face to face  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… yeah  
(I want to drink!! I want to drink!!)  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… Oh yeah  
(I want to drink!! I want to drink!!)  

(Clap your hands)  
(Everyone together)  
Don’t be shy  
(Clap your hands)  
(Everyone together)  
Let’s sing and dance the night away  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… yeah  
(I want to drink!! I want to drink!!)  
Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… Oh yeah  
(I want to drink!! I want to drink!!)  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… yeah  
(I want to drink!! I want to drink!!)  

Ki mi ni mu chu-  
All day long, you’re stuck in my head… Oh yeah  
(I want to drink!! I want to drink!!)
