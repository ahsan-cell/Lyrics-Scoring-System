**Translated Lyrics:**

At a thoughtless moment,  
The rain starts to fall, soaking the streets.  
You pretend not to notice,  
Setting your sails high, into the whirlpool.

Your treasured ideas  
Are kicked away with lifeless words,  
You act like you don’t care,  
Laughing as you dive deeper into the swirl.

To fight, I understand and break it down, though it truly hurts,  
I close my eyes and tell myself, "It’s okay."

Bursting into the windless sky,  
Swimming through the dry sea, getting hurt once more,  
You shine again,  
Don’t give up.  
I know the pain you hide behind your blink, those feelings,  
Ah, because I understand.

The melancholy that has fallen upon you  
Won't wash away, no matter how hard you try.  
You pretend it doesn’t matter,  
Accelerating, moving further ahead.  
It’s hard to stay beautiful,  
Kindness always turns against you,  
As I blur into myself, I tell myself, "It’s okay."

The clouds I aimed for are still so high,  
And the island I dreamed of is a faraway place, I know this,  
Yet I stepped forward, understanding all along,  
Don’t give up.  
I know the pain you hide behind your blink, those feelings,  
Ah, because I understand.

Reflected in the subway window, the tired, upside-down you,  
I’m singing this song for you.

Don’t cry.  
Everything you’ve spent will hold meaning until that time comes,  
Beyond those clouds, surely, surely.

Bursting into the windless sky,  
Swimming through the dry sea, getting hurt once more,  
You shine again,  
Don’t give up.  
I know the pain you hide behind your blink, those feelings,  
Ah, because I understand.
