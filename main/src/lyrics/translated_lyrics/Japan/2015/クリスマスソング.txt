**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Somewhere a bell is ringing,  
Words that don't quite fit come to mind, the cold feels nice,  
Why am I even in love?

[Pre-Chorus]  
Maybe it’s the song repeating about holy nights,  
Or the deliberately sparkling city lights.

[Chorus]  
The number of times I think of you,  
Makes my heart ache when we can’t meet.  
I’m trying to tell you how I feel,  
But it’s okay, I already know that much.  
There’s no point asking Santa for help,  
If I could, I’d want you right beside me,  
Not wanting you to go anywhere,  
I just want you to think of me all the time.  
But saying this feels so uncool,  
And it’ll just drag on, so I’ll keep it simple:  
I like you.

[Verse 2]  
Excited couples,  
Wearing reindeer antlers,  
How can they be so bold in public?  
No, I’m not envious or anything.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What would make you happy as a gift?  
What’s something only I can give you?

[Chorus]  
Even if your reply to "I love you"  
Is different from what I expected,  
That alone won’t make me dislike you.  
Wishing on a star isn’t really my style,  
But in the end, it’s you I can’t do without,  
I’m gazing up at the sky.

[Bridge]  
Back then when I met you,  
Just that alone,  
Uncovered parts of myself I never knew.

[Chorus]  
Every day I think of wanting to see you,  
And I want you to know that.  
In the crowd, I’m searching for you,  
I wonder if you’re laughing with someone else today.  
Deep inside, it hurts so much,  
If I could, I’d want you right beside me,  
Not wanting you to go anywhere,  
I just want you to think of me all the time.  
But again, saying this feels so uncool,  
And it’ll just drag on, so I’ll keep it simple:  
I like you.  
I’ll say it as many times as it takes until you hear me:  
I like you.
