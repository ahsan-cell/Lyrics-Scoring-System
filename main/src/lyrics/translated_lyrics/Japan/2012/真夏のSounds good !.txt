**Translated Lyrics:**

Lying down, peeling off my swimsuit,  
Your bold words linger in the air,  
Sweet and intoxicating,  
They carried a scent.

The endless blue of the sea and sky,  
It reminds me of our relationship.  
Though the horizon meets,  
Right now, you’re still like a willful little sister.

Midsummer sounds good!  
Whispering softly,  
I want to take the next step,  
In this love curriculum.  
The sound of the waves, sounds good!  
My heart is restless,  
More than last year,  
I’m getting serious.

On the sandy beach, sunbathing,  
Leaving you behind, I swam alone.  
Then suddenly, that kiss,  
Tasted salty on my lips.

It feels like the air has changed,  
From the scenery just moments ago.  
The sea and sky face each other,  
Reflecting their blues in harmony.

Midsummer sounds good!  
Whispering softly,  
I want to take the next step,  
In this love curriculum.  
The sound of the waves, sounds good!  
My heart is restless,  
More than last year,  
I’m getting serious.

Midsummer sounds good!  
I love you,  
The sound of the waves, sounds good!  
I finally said it.  
On the shore, good job!  
I love you,  
A perfect moment, good job!  
Isn’t it the season for love?  

Midsummer sounds good!
