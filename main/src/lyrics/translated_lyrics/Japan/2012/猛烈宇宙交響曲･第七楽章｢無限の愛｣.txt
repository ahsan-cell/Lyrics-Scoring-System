**Translated Lyrics:**

Even at the edge of the universe, I think of you  
Scattering wishes among countless shooting stars  
So far away (yet so close), I want to meet you (but can’t)  
It feels like I could reach you (but I can’t), always with tearful eyes  
Everyone (someday) becomes a star (and fades away)  
Fate? Destiny? Whose fault is it?

I’ll give you my everything  
Intense! Explosive! Powerful! Bursting! Blasting!  
Fierce!!  
Becoming stardust (turning into a shooting star)  
I’ll keep loving you (I can believe)  
My feelings (burning hot) are ablaze (they burn)  
Shining red, like Antares (yes, always and forever)

Even if it’s billions of light-years away (there’s nothing to fear)  
I don’t care! Yes, because I love you! (I can fly!)  
Wishes (eternally) won’t disappear (forever)  
The children of the stars will continue to protect you  
Fierce!!

Everyone! Let’s go!! Ohhh!!  
I want to love you, and I love you! Ai Ai Sa!  
Love will remain in my heart forever! Ai Ai Sa!  
All, all in the name of love!! Ai Ai Sa!  
Loved and loving, this is our present! Ai Ai Sa!

Accelerating (to the speed) sometimes makes my heart race  
Sparkling (brilliantly) shining even more (more and more)  
Every moment, full power

Someday, even if I shatter  
Intense! Explosive! Powerful! Bursting! Blasting!  
Fierce!!

No matter where in this universe (wherever I may be)  
I’ll find you (I can believe)  
Illuminating the darkness (with light) (I’ll deliver)  
With the glow of the yellow Centaurus (yes, sparkling brightly)

Far beyond the Milky Way (I met you)  
This miracle is inevitable (I can fly!)  
No matter how (far) far away (I believe)  
I will continue to think of you  
Fierce!!

Burning sun,  
Distant moon,  
Countless Andromeda galaxies,  
Vast Jupiter,  
Dark black holes,  
Love! Love! Love! Love! Love!  
Oh! Fierce!!  
Do you dislike me?  
Can’t you hear my voice?  
But I’ll dedicate this love to you! Wow!  
Intense! Explosive! Powerful! Bursting! Blasting!  
Oooooooh!! Fierce!!

Becoming stardust (turning into a shooting star)  
I’ll keep loving you (I can believe)  
My feelings (burning hot) are ablaze (they burn)  
Shining red, like Antares (yes, always and forever)

Even if it’s billions of light-years away (there’s nothing to fear)  
I don’t care! Yes, because I love you! (I can fly!)  
Wishes (eternally) won’t disappear (forever)  
The children of the stars will continue to protect you  
Fierce!!
