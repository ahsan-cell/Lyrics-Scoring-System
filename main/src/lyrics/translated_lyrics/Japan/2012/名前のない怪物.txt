**Translated Lyrics:**

Fairy tales seem to have just died  
In the brick hospital, I can’t sing right  
In the foggy night, a red moon floats  
Look at me, don’t look away  

Born within these black iron bars  
I came into this world  
Wish for the price of malice  
As you desire, I’ll give it to you  
Now let’s bring forth justice  
Before we break, before we’re broken  
Pay the price of fate  
Let’s go together, nameless monster  

There’s a ringing in my ears  
The barbed wire is so loud  
I can’t remember the melody from that day  
The rain still won’t stop  
I can’t see anything  
Look, I’ve grown so big  

Let the black rain fall from this sky  
I am something unwanted  
A cracked neurosis  
To the bystanders who love the same sin  
Now tremble with justice  
Embrace the wounds that can’t be erased  
Accept this body  
Let’s go together, nameless monster  

Born within these black iron bars  
I came into this world  
Wish for the price of malice  
As you desire, I’ll give it to you  
Now let’s bring forth justice  
Before we break, before we’re broken  
Pay the price of fate  
Reap what you sow, nameless monster  

Let the black rain fall from this sky  
I am something unwanted  
A cracked neurosis  
To the bystanders who love the same sin  
Now tremble with justice  
Embrace the wounds that can’t be erased  
Accept this body  
Let’s go together, nameless monster
