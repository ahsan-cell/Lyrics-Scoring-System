**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Reina, Ami]  
On the observation deck  
Of a tall building,  
Just the two of us  
(We can fly, don’t you think so? Hey!)  
The wide sky and  
The city looking small,  
It makes my heart race  
(I don’t know why my heartbeat is too fast)  

[Pre-Chorus: Yuzuna, Ami, Karen, Reina]  
From here, it’s just beginning,  
The blueprint of our future,  
Everything that makes my heart dance,  
I love it all.  

[Chorus: All]  
Fly so high  
Follow me, follow me  
Follow me, follow me, baby  
With both hands (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Spread wide (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Fly so high  
Lucky me, lucky me  
Never be unhappy, baby  
Just like this (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
I feel like I can fly (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Since meeting you,  
I feel like I’ve finally found freedom.  
You just follow me.  

[Verse 2: Ami, Reina]  
I’m not alone,  
I know that for sure,  
I can start running  
(I’m not living if you’re not by my side)  
In moments when I might fall,  
You stop my heart  
(Watching me over and catching my heart)  

[Pre-Chorus: Karen, Reina, Yuzuna, Ami]  
When I’m smiling, I don’t notice,  
I brush off the accidents,  
Even if it gets a little cloudy sometimes,  
It’s okay.  

[Chorus: All]  
Fly so high  
Follow me, follow me  
Follow me, follow me, baby  
How far can we go? (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Fly so high  
Lucky me, lucky me  
Never be unhappy, baby  
Let’s try it (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
And see (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Even if I pretend to be strong,  
I’m really hiding tears inside,  
You just follow me.  

[Chorus: All, Reina]  
Fly so high  
Follow me, follow me  
Follow me, follow me, baby  
With both hands (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Spread wide (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Fly so high  
Lucky me, lucky me  
Never be unhappy, baby  
Just like this (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
I feel like I can fly (Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Since meeting you,  
I feel like I’ve finally found freedom.  
You just follow me.  

[Outro: All]  
Follow me, follow me  
Follow me, follow me, baby (Baby)  
Follow me, follow me  
Follow me, follow me, baby (Baby)
