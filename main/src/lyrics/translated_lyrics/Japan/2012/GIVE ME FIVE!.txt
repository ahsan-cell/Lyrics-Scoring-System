**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
The song of cherry blossoms flows through the town,  
In the blink of an eye, it was farewell day.  
In the corner of the school building's wall,  
We all secretly wrote our messages together.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
The uniforms  
We’ll take them off now,  
As we’re blown by the spring breeze.  
Every flower  
Eventually falls,  
But we’ll see new dreams.

**[Chorus]**  
My friend,  
Let’s believe in tomorrow,  
Which shines brighter  
Than our memories.  
Yes, graduation is  
Not an exit,  
But a new entrance.  
My friend,  
We’ll each walk our own paths,  
So don’t say goodbye,  
We’ll meet again soon.  
So for now,  
Let’s high-five!

**[Verse 2]**  
No matter how many photos we take,  
We can’t capture what truly mattered.  
Even when we fought and weren’t speaking,  
For some reason, I had my arm around that guy.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
No one is  
Leaving just yet,  
The classroom feels so small.  
With lingering feelings,  
Ahead in time,  
Our future awaits.

**[Chorus]**  
Instead of holding back tears,  
Let’s cry like never before,  
Since we were born.  
Yes, there will be  
Many more tough times,  
So let’s get used to it.  
Tears,  
When we show our messy faces,  
We can talk about anything.  
We’re lifelong friends,  
Don’t forget that.  
Let’s high-five!

**[Instrumental Bridge]**

**[Chorus]**  
My friend,  
Let’s believe in tomorrow,  
Which shines brighter  
Than our memories.  
Yes, graduation is  
Not an exit,  
But a new entrance.  
My friend,  
Meeting you was  
The best part  
Of our youthful days.  
There’s still a thank you  
I couldn’t say…  
Let’s high-five!
