**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You were about to say something,  
As the train passes on the elevated tracks.  
I tried to read your moving lips,  
Is it a Yes or a No?  
At the baseball field by the riverbank,  
The metallic sound of a bat hitting the ball,  
If only it could fly over to us,  
Breaking our silence.

[Pre-Chorus]  
If you don’t take that first step,  
Nothing will ever begin.  
Don’t find the answer  
In your head alone.

[Chorus]  
Is it wrong to fall in love?  
Come and leap into my arms.  
Just being young, that’s enough  
To keep the adults from interfering.  
Is it wrong to fall in love?  
I understand how you feel.  
If you hide your emotions,  
You’re just a mannequin in a uniform.

[Verse 2]  
With the winter pressure pattern,  
My heart feels like it’s freezing.  
I’ll give you a can of coffee  
From the vending machine.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even if I wait for graduation,  
Nothing will change, right?  
There are choices  
That can only be made now.

[Chorus]  
What part of yourself are you protecting?  
There’s no such thing as pure innocence.  
It’s an illusion that adults seek.  
What part of yourself are you protecting?  
I truly like you.  
Where is that intention?  
You’re just a mannequin in a uniform.

[Bridge]  
It’s not that you can’t do it,  
You just haven’t tried.  
The door to the future  
Is right there,  
And I invite you again and again.  
It’s you who will be reborn.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Leave it to me.

[Chorus]  
Is it wrong to fall in love?  
Come and leap into my arms.  
Just being young, that’s enough  
To keep the adults from interfering.  
Is it wrong to fall in love?  
I understand how you feel.  
If you hide your emotions,  
You’re just a mannequin in a uniform.  
You’re just a mannequin in a uniform.
