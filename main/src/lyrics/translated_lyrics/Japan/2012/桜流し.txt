**Translated Lyrics:**

The freshly bloomed flowers scatter away,  
You watched with a hint of regret, saying,  
"This year has come so quickly,"  
You were so beautiful then.  
If you could see me now,  
What would you think?  
Living without you,  
Everybody finds love,  
Everybody finds love in the end,  
In the end.

Somewhere in the town you once protected,  
If I could hear the healthy cries of a newborn today,  
You would surely be happy,  
With the footsteps of our continuation.

Everybody finds love,  
In the end.

I can’t believe we’ll never meet again,  
I still haven’t said anything,  
I still haven’t said anything.  
Watching the freshly bloomed flowers scatter,  
The trees that witnessed it feel so helpless.  
No matter how scared I am, I won’t look away,  
If there’s love at the end of it all.
