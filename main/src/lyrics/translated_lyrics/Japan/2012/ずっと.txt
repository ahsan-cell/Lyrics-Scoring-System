**Translated Lyrics:**

I want to see you, though I can’t, my love won’t fade away, Missing you

These feelings are so shy,
I keep them locked away every day.
Always trying to look cool, but it just makes me anxious,
But you know what?
Fireworks reflecting on the summer sea,
Since that day, I've been devoted to you, always just you.

Clumsily flowing,
Our time together is every moment.
Always fighting, regretting each time.

The truth is,
Past, present, future, everything,
From the bottom of my heart, I’m devoted to you, always thinking of you.

In the twilight sky, I was thinking only of you again,
On nights we can’t meet, at least let me hear your voice.

Always, always, always unchanged,
The more I think, the more anxious I become,
But always, always, always unchanging,
I want to see you, though I can’t, my love won’t fade away, Missing you.

You might also like that day,
I fell for you, unadorned,
When we clashed, it broke apart,
Let’s share our stories again, nestled in the buried past.

Even now,
My love for you overflows,
No matter how many hearts I have, it’s never enough, that’s how I feel.

When we’re apart, it’s lonely, yet why is it warm?
It’s because you’re always in my heart.

Always, always, always unchanged,
The more I think, the more anxious I become,
But always, always, always unchanging,
I want to see you, though I can’t, my love won’t fade away, Oh Oh.

I’ve come to distrust everything,
Even my understanding of you feels wrong,
I’ve locked love deep in my heart,
And felt like I was all alone.

The love I have for you,
And the love you have for me, a harmony,
To the past that says goodbye,
Always, always, always unchanged,
Before my feelings turn into memories.

Always, always, always unchanging,
Because I love you endlessly,
I’ll go see you right now.

Always, always, Oh Oh U…
Right now, Oh I Miss you Baby,
From now on, always, always.
