**Translated Lyrics:**

We're back again  
24karats  
D.Inc baby  
Let's get it started  
Exile tribe  

So keep your head up to the sky  

Pure and untainted, shining so bright, we go rock the 24  
Every day, every time, the real thing shines even more, we rock the gold  
Pure and untainted, shining so bright, we go rock the audience  
Every day, every time, we live the rock star life, yeah  
Rock the real...

Here we come back again, constantly inheriting legends, reviving the shine  
With a strong power that won't fade, in our hands, that ambition becomes history  

Even if our forms change  
The light that continues to shine must be in our hearts  
A heartbeat that beats faster  

Like a laser beam forming a straight line, shining  
Directly and proudly emitting light, 24karats  
This tribe, shout out each truth, oh! (oh!)  
I wanna hear you say oh! (oh!)  
Pure gold, unmistakable soul  
We're gonna take you higher and higher  

We boys, wanting to sing forever  
Boosting ourselves, polishing up, freakout!  
From our shared DNA, we unleash power  
Connecting to the next generation  

No matter how many times we fall, we rise again  
Because we want to see a future we haven't reached yet, we can't stop  
The bond is strong and deep, and it's real  

Like a laser beam forming a straight line, shining  
Directly and proudly emitting light, 24karats  
This tribe, shout out each truth, oh! (oh!)  
I wanna hear you say oh! (oh!)  
Pure gold, unmistakable soul  
We're gonna take you higher and higher  

If aiming for 1st place makes us shining fighters  
Then deceiving ourselves is not allowed  
Carrying endless wounds and a proud heart  
We can become stronger, trading pain for strength  

Together in an unending dream  
A unique light that keeps shining, that's life  
Unyielding comrades dance  

Like a laser beam forming a straight line, shining  
Directly and proudly emitting light, 24karats  
This tribe, shout out each truth, oh! (oh!)  
I wanna hear you say oh! (oh!)  
Pure gold, unmistakable soul  
We're gonna take you higher and higher  

With every layer, the surprise increases, daily brushing up, that's just natural  
This is the eternal proof, though it feels like everything's rusted  
Look at me now, our soul, can you see this firewall?  
Keeping away the fakes, we lead the way, come along, let's go  
Shining resolve, never fading, 24  
Genuine, show me your 24  
Pride held high, the soul of 24  
Yeah, number one player  
Never say never, this phrase always in my heart, one  
If you're going to shake your head in denial, then shake it to this hot beat  

Follow my heart, it starts to shine  
Follow my heart, it shines even brighter  
Follow my heart, yes, a shining tomorrow  
24karats forever  

Like a laser beam forming a straight line, shining  
Directly and proudly emitting light, 24karats  
This tribe, shout out each truth, oh! (oh!)  
I wanna hear you say oh! (oh!)  

Like a laser beam forming a straight line, shining  
Directly and proudly emitting light, 24karats  
This tribe, shout out each truth, oh! (oh!)  
I wanna hear you say oh! (oh!)  
Pure gold, unmistakable soul  
We're gonna take you higher and higher  
Party people, get your hands up  
Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up  

Exile tribe D.Inc 24karats  

Party people, get your hands up  
Get your hands up, get your hands up, get your hands up  

From audience to audience, next level  
From this tribe to neo Japan  

Party people, get your hands up  
Get your hands up, get your hands up  

We're gonna take you higher and higher
