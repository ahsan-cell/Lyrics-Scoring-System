**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
The times are changing now  
We have a wish in our hearts  
These tears and those smiles  
Connect everything, wow, wow  

[Chorus]  
The wind is blowing, I will live here  
In the clear sky, someone shouted  
Tomorrow is here, hope is here  
If I can laugh with you, if we can share our dreams  
We can believe in each other, we can feel for each other  
This era, us, this moment  

[Verse 1]  
Things I can't put into words, tears that overflow  
Everything I've felt with a trembling heart  
Has shaped who I am today  
Meetings and farewells  
Have strengthened my resolve  
Because of that day when we waved and made a promise  
We are here now  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I can hear a gentle song  
There are words that push me forward  
This life, this moment  
Let it be someone's light, wow, wow  

[Chorus]  
Oh wind, keep blowing, let’s live together  
Even on days when the clear sky feels sad  
I'm not alone, your voice is by my side  
I want to laugh with you, I want to share our dreams  
So we can sing together, so we can play together  
This era, us, this moment  

[Verse 2]  
Rather than gaining strength  
I want to overcome my weaknesses  
I don’t want to run away from what I want to protect  
The bud is right there  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Beloved one, I won’t forget  
There’s pride dwelling in my heart  
This fate, this courage  
Let it become our wish, wow, wow  

[Chorus]  
In the wind, the sun will rise again here  
Let’s build answers in our clashing days  
This era, each other, this moment  

[Bridge]  
There’s a present entrusted to us  
There’s a path we must walk  
Living the continuation of the beginning  
The bond is within my heart  
Always, always  
Wow, wow  

[Chorus]  
The wind is blowing, I will live here  
I will keep shouting into the clear sky  
New days are here, they are here  
Oh wind, keep blowing, I want to connect our dreams  
We can love each other, we can create together  
This era, us, this moment  

[Outro]  
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la  
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la  
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la  
La, la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la, laa
