**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Even though I love you  
So deeply like this,  
I’m just pretending,  
Pushing my bike as I walk.  
You laugh so innocently.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Along the coast road,  
To my part-time job,  
The sun is teasing me.

[Chorus]  
Gingham check,  
The short-sleeved shirt  
You’re wearing,  
It’s so androgynous.  
It’s both lovely and bittersweet,  
My heart is a checkered pattern.  
Gingham check,  
The pattern of love,  
Blue, white, blue—  
Which one could it be?  
Should I express my feelings?  
My hesitation is  
Gingham check.

[Verse 2]  
The sea right in front of me  
Is all shades of blue,  
Telling everything.  
Just a simple word,  
But I can’t bring myself to say it.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Because I’m so timid,  
This relationship we have  
Is happiness, after all.

[Chorus]  
Gingham check,  
Summer has passed,  
When will I wear  
A cardigan again?  
I can’t walk this road  
Forever, but still,  
Gingham check,  
The deadline for love,  
Yes, no, yes—  
It’s okay to let it slide,  
Because you’re so important to me.  
Until next summer,  
Gingham check.

[Bridge]  
The sea sparkles,  
Reflecting light,  
My mixed feelings  
Are both light and shadow.

[Chorus]  
Gingham check,  
The short-sleeved shirt  
You’re wearing,  
It’s so androgynous.  
It’s both lovely and bittersweet,  
My heart is a checkered pattern.  
Gingham check,  
The pattern of love,  
Blue, white, blue—  
Which one could it be?  
Should I express my feelings?  
My hesitation is  
Gingham check.
