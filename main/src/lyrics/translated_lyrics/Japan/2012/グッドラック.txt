**Translated Lyrics:**

You and loneliness surely appeared together,  
Foolish me, I didn’t understand for a long time.  
Even when you’re not by my side, my heart screams strong,  
I learned from loneliness that you are always there.

If we hold hands, will we someday drift apart?  
Cowardly me, I can’t help but think about it.  
The warmth my palm remembers, close to myself yet not mine,  
I learned from the absence of you through that warmth.

Please take care, and if possible, keep smiling,  
If you forget, just stay as you are, follow where your soul desires.  
I’ll do the same, though it might take some time,  
With every tear, I realize I was never truly alone.

When we said goodbye, it was the first time we truly looked at each other,  
I embraced each of the words that were lacking.  
With a straightforward gaze,  
I learned from goodbye that I once existed too.

You and loneliness have always been with me,  
In the places I was too weak to see.  
The tears that come from there are the greatest proof,  
I learned from loneliness that you are always there.

Please take care, and if possible, keep smiling,  
Even if deceived or doubtful, believe in what you chose.  
Even if laughed at or lost, follow where your soul desires.  
Even if you remember, just stay as you are, don’t let your heart ache.  
I love the tomorrow you live, even if I’m not beside you then.  
I told you, I can say it now, I was never truly alone.
