**Translated Lyrics:**

In this world, it feels like I've walked alone,  
Wearing a face that hides my truth,  
That I can't do anything by myself,  
Even such an obvious truth, I pretended not to know,  
Surely, I must have hurt someone along the way.

I thought if I became stronger, even loneliness  
Would fade away, but I was wrong.

If you are in this future of mine,  
Will the scenery I envisioned change?  
A place where I can always laugh and cry,  
In my true self, I’ve been searching for it all along.

As a child, I believed that when I grew up,  
I would somehow stop getting hurt.  
But before I knew it, everyone was hiding  
Their feelings behind smiles, living with burdens.

And surely, people grow stronger  
As they walk alongside what they wish to protect.

Even when this future seems unclear,  
If you’re there laughing by my side,  
Even solitary moments become a source of strength,  
I can believe in tomorrow’s self even more.

Among countless encounters,  
Some people just pass by,  
Yet you are the one  
Who has always been here.

If you are in this future of mine,  
The scenery I envisioned will start to change.  
A place where I can always laugh and cry,  
In my true self, I’ve been searching for it all along.

Even when this future seems unclear,  
If you’re there laughing by my side,  
Even solitary moments become a source of strength,  
I’ll come to love tomorrow’s self even more.
