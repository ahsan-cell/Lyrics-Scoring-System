**Translated Lyrics:**

(What do you want to do?)  
(What is the meaning of life?)

Ideal and reality, just a click away, even if it changes at the speed of light  
The distance is farther than the other side of the Earth; we can’t become Adam and Eve  
Tracing back to where sadness was born  
If I could gently touch those wounds and heal them  
Overflowing feelings, love can become the light that shines on you  
So painfully beautiful  
Even if the future I envision doesn’t include me  
For now, I’ll hold you close  
I want to draw fate closer and keep shining  
I want to believe that miracles can happen  
I want to believe  

Even if words are filled with hesitation and consideration,  
If emotions are reduced to mere symbols,  
Let me hear your true voice that doesn’t reach deep within your heart  
If everything has an end,  
Then even suffering should someday fade away  
Overflowing feelings, love turns into a burning pain in my chest  
So dearly cherished  
Even if I’m blamed by the silent voices of the world  
I will embrace it all for you  

People were born to know sorrow,  
But that’s not true; I want to know more love  
If loneliness exists to understand warmth,  
Happiness is always right there  
Overflowing feelings, love can become the light that shines on you  
So painfully beautiful (People were born to know sorrow…)  
Even if the future I envision doesn’t include me  
For now, I’ll hold you close (People, people, people are eternal, eternal…)  
I want to draw fate closer and keep shining  
I want to believe that miracles can happen  
I want to believe
