**Translated Lyrics:**

When I grasp your withered hand tightly,  
I think, "If only time could stop like this..."  
Your eyes, peering in, are searching for lies,  
How foolish, I laugh and reply, "Nothing will come out."

Dreaming of a distant future, feeling troubled,  
Today, my thoughts go back and forth in my mind.  
Don't touch me; I want to keep things as they are,  
I want to witness the path of my heart.

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
To the ugliness of myself that sullies my dreams.  
Even if someone mocks me for being a defenseless dreamer,  
I want to hold onto my unwavering feelings and wishes.

The familiar places look different now,  
It's really because my perspective has changed.  
When I hear words like "pure" or "honest,"  
I can't help but feel malice;  
Surely, I've already got some darkness within me.

Trying to forget, yet recalling it all,  
No matter how old we get, we're all quite similar.  
Things I don't want to lose, one by one,  
Add color to the path of my heart.  
If you're lost, just listen closely to the river's mouth in your heart,  
You can hear the flow calling you.  
In the rustling, sparkling, transparent stream,  
Just let your prayers float like a bamboo boat.

When you cry and laugh,  
Each time, it shakes my heart.  
With the desire to be stronger,  
My chest trembles.

Don't forget the light that resides in you,  
I want to watch over it so it never fades away.

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye,  
To my weakness that tramples on my aspirations.  
Even if sadness and loneliness spill out sometimes,  
The path of my tears transforms into a beautiful river.  
There,  
Just let your prayers float like a bamboo boat.
