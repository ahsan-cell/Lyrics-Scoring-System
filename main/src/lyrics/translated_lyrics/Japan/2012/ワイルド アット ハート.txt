**Translated Lyrics:**

This one life we have, let it roll along,  
Laughing and crying, let’s live on, Baby.  
I don’t need the freedom someone else has decided,  
And someday, we’ll go somewhere that’s not here.

Even if strong winds blow east and west, I don't care,  
No matter how much I run, tomorrow will come with a blank stare.

Is there an answer beyond this rush? La...  
We don’t seek it out.  
OK, Alright, to the ends of the earth, with you, endlessly.

This one life we have, let it roll along,  
Laughing and crying, let’s live on, Baby.  
I don’t need the freedom someone else has decided,  
And someday, we’ll go somewhere that’s not here.

If we’re carrying too much, let’s just throw it away,  
Let tomorrow be carried by tomorrow’s wind.  
No one knows what will happen,  
We just live for now, let’s go.

Breathless, running day by day, pretty words don’t suit me,  
Sometimes going against the flow, even if I burn out, it’s fine.  
Even with a tattered pride, because you’re here, La...  
Let’s break free from this boring town.  
Ride on, right now, without looking back, bidding farewell to yesterday.

To my friends I’ve met, just as you are is enough,  
There’s nothing to hesitate about.  
We surely hold deep within our hearts,  
Instead of tears, let’s laugh and say goodbye.

If the time comes to set off on a journey,  
I’ll see you off without saying a word.  
No promises are needed,  
We just live for now, my friend.

Yes, even in the darkness, if I fall, I’ll reach out my hand.

This one life we have, let it roll along,  
Laughing and crying, let’s live on, Baby.  
I don’t need the freedom someone else has decided,  
And someday, we’ll go somewhere that’s not here.

If we’re carrying too much, let’s just throw it away,  
Let tomorrow be carried by tomorrow’s wind.  
No one knows what will happen,  
We just live for now, let’s go.
