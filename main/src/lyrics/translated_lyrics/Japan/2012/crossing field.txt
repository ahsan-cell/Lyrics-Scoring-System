**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Acknowledging my cowardly past,  
I was scared without understanding.  
The self behind me reflects reality now.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I painted countless skies,  
This place must be  
Where a fleeting heart gets disturbed.

[Chorus]  
My body jumped high in dreams,  
Shaking off any anxiety that clings to me.  
Little sleeping thoughts start to spread,  
Realizing the weak me, if you're here,  
I could stand strong in this dark world.  
A heart dreaming long is truly eternal.

[Post-Chorus]  
I wanna always be with you,  
I'll give you everything I have.

[Verse 2]  
The guiding light I was searching for,  
When I touch it, I remember everything.  
It gives me this irreplaceable, precious now.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
With my eyes closed, I learned about the world,  
It’s always warm yet painful.

[Chorus]  
Our certain wishes intertwine,  
The visible doubts have begun to move.  
Wanting to protect you, the wounds I bear,  
Drifted in a deep sleep.  
It was a promise that never changed,  
The bond we believed in is so vivid.

[Bridge]  
Until my voice reaches you, I’ll call your name,  
I want to feel this miracle of our meeting even more.

[Chorus]  
My body jumped high in dreams,  
Shaking off any anxiety that clings to me.  
Little sleeping thoughts start to spread,  
Realizing the weak me, if you're here,  
I could stand strong in this dark world.  
A heart dreaming long is truly eternal.

[Post-Chorus]  
I wanna always be with you,  
I wanna hold you tight right now.  
I swear I will wipe your tears,  
I'll give you everything I have.
