**Translated Lyrics:**

Before I knew it, I had forgotten  
And when I realized, tears overflowed  
It wasn't like I had decided this,  
But perhaps I felt miserable.

I bit my lip to avoid crying,  
Carrying the weight of those everyday struggles.  
But the "It's okay" you gave me  
Sounded like "It's alright now."

The "tears I won't show" will surely one day  
Turn into a rainbow, lighting up the world,  
Becoming a light that protects  
The people I hold dear.  
Even with the burdens we all carry,  
We put on brave faces and pretend to be strong.  
As long as you can smile, even through tears, tears, tears.

On the street corner, there's a place I should be,  
Chasing after fragments I've lost, fighting on.  
If it's love or dreams, I choose to be strong,  
There are tears that support someone else too.

On my way home alone, I see my reflection in the window,  
A slightly tired expression, but the people around me  
Are just the same, each carrying smiles they want to protect  
And futures they wish to create, walking and fighting on, holding up their strength.  
Because there are people who share both joy and sorrow.

We are waiting eagerly for fulfilled days,  
Running through life with passion.  
Sometimes lost, but still searching for kindness,  
In this city, it feels like I might lose my way.

The "tears I won't show" will surely one day  
Turn into a rainbow, lighting up the world,  
Becoming a light that protects  
The people I hold dear.  
Even with the burdens we all carry,  
We put on brave faces and pretend to be strong.  
As long as you can smile, even through tears, tears, tears.

Tears and strength are vows to overcome,  
Becoming the light that guides the people I cherish.  
If you are smiling, I can keep a brave face.  
"Even on days when I shed tears,"  
I know I can laugh again.
