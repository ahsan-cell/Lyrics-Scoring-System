**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Where should I start to eat?  
Is it something delicious or something bad?  
I really can’t tell at all,  
In this world full of rules.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The Buddha always intervenes,  
Isn’t patience the proper way?  
Oh-oh-oh, the demon tempts my soul,  
Please, go ahead, don’t hold back.

[Chorus]  
Ah, open wide that mouth of yours,  
The feast, the feast begins on Monday.  
What a waste, just once in life,  
Eat only what you love.

[Verse 2]  
Ah, which one should I turn over?  
A white ticket or a black ticket?  
Shall we take a gamble?  
Living or dying, it’s all just paper thin.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Buddha drops a thread like a spider’s silk,  
It’s not too late, come on out.  
The voice of hell echoes in my ears,  
Stepping off the path isn’t so bad.

[Chorus]  
Ah, this feast is in full swing,  
Tonight, tonight, don’t go home just yet.  
The party is lively, oh how nice,  
Fall as far as you can fall.

[Bridge]  
A-ai-ya-ya-ya,  
Spin and spin, unfold and reveal.  
A-ai-ya-ya-ya,  
Spin and spin, unfold it now.  
A-ai-ya-ya-ya,  
Spin and spin, unfold and reveal.  
A-ai-ya-ya-ya,  
Spin and spin, unfold it now.

[Chorus]  
Ah, open wide that mouth of yours,  
The feast, the feast begins on Monday.  
What a waste, just once in life,  
Eat only what you love.  
Fall as far as you can fall.
