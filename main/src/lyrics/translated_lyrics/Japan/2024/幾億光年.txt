**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Let me hear your voice once more,  
Staying as it is, unable to turn the page,  
The calendar of summer days.

[Verse 2]  
Just say "I’m home" and show me a smile,  
I don’t even know where to send it,  
I keep forgetting things.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I can hear the sound of my heart breaking,  
Do you know how much I loved you?  
I can never add to these memories again,  
Holding onto them, I live on.

[Chorus]  
Day by day,  
At what speed should I chase,  
To meet you again?  
The days we spent close together, the meaning of living,  
You gave that to me.  
So,  
I always keep you in my heart,  
Can you still hear my voice?  
In these unending days, a journey to meet you,  
Wait for me with that smile that suits you so well.

[Post-Chorus]  
Words from deep within that I couldn’t say,  
Now I can give them to you just as they are.

[Verse 3]  
When I whisper, it feels like the distance is gone,  
With fingertips just a breath away,  
I felt like I could reach you.

[Verse 4]  
I wonder why, being apart makes words overflow,  
Laughing now, saying it’s too late.

[Pre-Chorus]  
You were the only one I found, a shooting star from long ago,  
What kind of wish was floating in your mind?  
On that day, you looked up,  
Gazing at the deep blue ahead.

[Chorus]  
Day by day,  
Crossing billions of years of distance,  
Like a star conveying its brilliance,  
An unchanging love, a certain light,  
I’ll keep wishing until it reaches you.  
So,  
If someday we can meet again,  
Let’s arrange to meet in the glow,  
So you won’t get lost,  
I’ll wait, shining without blinking.

[Post-Chorus]  
The warmth you gave me will never fade,  
Embracing it, I’ll keep living in the now.

[Bridge]  
I’ll call your name, day after day,  
I’ll keep shouting, let’s stay just as we are.

[Breakdown]  
Day by day,  
At what speed should I chase,  
To meet you again?  
The days we shared, the seasons suddenly,  
Carrying only you, heading far away.

[Chorus]  
So,  
I always keep you in my heart,  
Can you still hear my voice?  
As the days move forward, every time I open my eyes,  
I believe I’m getting closer to our fate.

[Post-Chorus]  
Words from deep within that I couldn’t say,  
Now I can give them to you just as they are.

[Outro]  
No matter how much time flows, eternally,  
"I Love You" will never become past tense.
