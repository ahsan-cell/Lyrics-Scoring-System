**Translated Lyrics:**

Jonathan dodges with an invincible mask,  
Yearning to transcend that power, the ripple rush.  
Even the mud I rinse my mouth with, JoJo's Erina,  
You're perfect yet beneath contempt,  
A genius "rival" you are!  
How many slices of bread have you eaten?  
What’s your favorite dog?  
The first opponent was this Dio!  
Do you remember?  
I hate dogs.  
No matter how many times I'm shot,  
HURRY UP! HURRY UP!  
Calmly yet brightly,  
The mask that seems to fit but doesn’t holds unknown value.  
Lord Joestar, poison, poison, poison!  
Danny too, incinerate, incinerate, incinerate!  
What’s your favorite rank?  
Number one?  
Come on, answer me!  
JoJo, I’m filled with regret,  
Having harbored such trivial ambitions.  
Whether it’s a lie or truth, I can’t know,  
Once again, I fall alone into that mask.  
Now, I will transcend humanity!  
The ripple corrupts my hands,  
JoJo is the perfect and ultimate rival!  
Never to appear again,  
The reincarnation of the brightest star, ah~  
With that courage, I sever my mission,  
Captivating everyone,  
That mask,  
That fate,  
Even if it’s a lie, it’s the highest “high!”  
High defeat.  
Jonathan is special,  
This Dio was just a bonus from the start.  
I’m the supporting role of the star.  
Everything is thanks to Jonathan,  
No way, it’s disgusting.  
There’s no way there’s no envy or jealousy.  
This isn’t in vain,  
That’s why I can’t forgive.  
I can’t forgive JoJo if he’s not perfect!  
I can’t forgive myself.  
I won’t acknowledge anyone stronger than JoJo!  
Everyone believes and reveres,  
Truly the strongest and invincible rival!  
No weaknesses in sight,  
Harboring the brightest star.  
You mustn’t show any weakness, no way!  
I don’t want to die; I truly want to escape.  
If it’s not unique, it’s all in vain!  
That’s the real sorrow.  
With my specialty, the ripple unleashes its rush,  
Only this bloodline can finish it off,  
Touching the carotid artery, I can sever it.  
This is the essence of our duel.  
Flowing blood, victims, demons,  
Hidden behind these eyelids, the piercing gaze.  
This Dio dances madly, a loser,  
Indeed, the stars are pure love.  
Having been loved by someone,  
Loving someone else,  
Such ambitions of a villain,  
One day, they will become real.  
“I believe.”  
One day, I’ll surely have it all,  
This Dio is such a greedy rival!  
Against a madman, like divine fire,  
I want to face you properly,  
So today, I seek blood, that bloodline,  
Wishing for the day it will be severed.  
Yet still,  
I couldn’t say it to JoJo and Joushu, but ah~  
Finally, I can say it; this is definitely not a lie.  
“I can sever it!”
