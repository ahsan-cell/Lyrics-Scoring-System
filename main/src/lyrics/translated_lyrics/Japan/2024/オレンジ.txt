**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I won’t say goodbye, there are no promises  
Because we’ll meet again, just you and me  
Biting into the horizon, a little orange  
The sweet and sour light is dazzling  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Sweat sliding down, voices echoing  
Shoulders bumping, laughing and crying together  

[Chorus]  
Towards tomorrow, into the orange sky  
We’ll spread our wings and fly  
Just one more second, just one more second  
This moment that feels so precious, surely  

[Verse 2]  
Carrying big dreams on small shoulders  
We’ve come this far, you know  
It’s not just the future we envisioned  
But it was all so much fun, wasn’t it?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Breathless, we just keep running  
What we were chasing was the heat in our hearts  
You might also like  
[Chorus]  
In moments that won’t come again  
Let’s stay connected forever  
What shall we draw? What shall we do?  
I try to imagine, but surely, surely  

[Bridge]  
Even certain things will be understood someday  
It’s okay to make mistakes, don’t be afraid  
You can just be you, oh  

[Chorus]  
Like a slightly bitter orange  
The lingering bittersweetness remains  
Just one more second, just one more second  
I’ll go on while cherishing this  

Even when the limited time  
Suddenly becomes nostalgic someday  
Don’t stop, don’t look back  
Just keep moving forward, it’s alright  
Surely, surely
