**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yeah, boy

[Verse 1]  
Cheat, gifted, wild skills, wanted  
Taboo, forbidden moves, clearly a blind spot  
Foul play, otherworldly, not of this world  
Impossible game, you didn’t hear that…  
Ay, rivals all in sync  
Wow, rivals all in sync  
Bugs, luck, I won’t admit it, no way  
Seriously? This is all… in the flesh?

[Chorus]  
It's in the flesh, it's in the flesh, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born

[Verse 2]  
Before I can show my true power  
It seems the opponent backs out first  
The hurdles are high, very happy  
Clearly, I’m outstanding, number one  
Still shedding my skin every day (Bling, bling, bling)  
I don’t need anyone’s shine, your ice is icier (Icy)  
I may seem like I can’t do much at a glance, but very happy  
Oh, they’re getting mad… shocked around me  
Blessed with family and friends (Happy)  
Already in a foul position, just leave it to me (Bang-bang-bang)  
Not in textbooks, not in workbooks  
A super bad curse, listen

[Pre-Chorus]  
Mirror, oh mirror, tell me  
Who's the best? I'm the best! Oh yeah  
Going as far as I can in the flesh  
To the next, to the top

[Chorus]  
Now singin'  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
(Now singin')  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
(Now singin')  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
To the next, to the top

[Refrain]  
Ey-day, just being myself is super flex  
Ey-day, no one can interrupt (Don't test)  
Ey-day, just being myself is super flex  
Ey-day, no one can make a peep (Don't test)

[Verse 3]  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
No academic background, no criminal record, easy bling-bling  
This existence itself is a cultural asset, my brain bling-bling  
I can buy luxury cars, but I don’t have a license, my ride is green, green  
Shaking up the nation with my unique style  
This tongue is bling-bling  
If it were a bullet, it’d be full  
Kansai dialect, raw words  
Music, fortune, goddess of victory, tonight too, three-way bang-bang  
Competing with characters straight out of a manga  
Overwhelming power from this head and mouth  
This body has no tattoos  
This face has no scars  
Repeated damage leaves  
Impressive wrinkles marking the years  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
I was born to bling and bang just as I am, Japan  
Ay

[Pre-Chorus]  
Mirror, oh mirror, tell me  
Who's the best? I'm the best! Oh yeah  
Going as far as I can in the flesh  
To the next, to the top

[Chorus]  
Now singin'  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
(Now singin')  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
(Now singin')  
Bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang, bling-bang-bang-born  
To the next, to the top

[Refrain]  
Ey-day, just being myself is super flex  
Ey-day, no one can interrupt (Don't test)  
Ey-day, just being myself is super flex  
Ey-day, no one can make a peep (Don't test)
