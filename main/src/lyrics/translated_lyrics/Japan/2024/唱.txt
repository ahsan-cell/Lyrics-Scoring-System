**Translated Lyrics:**

Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
Okay, let’s get started  
Listen, listen  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
Kabuki (a traditional Japanese theater)  

[Verse 1]  
Ha! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, showtime  
Come on, the top is calling  
Let’s mix it up, hell yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Little by little, feeling good, brah, brah, brah! Pow  
No one can stop this vibe (Ha, ha)  

[Verse 2]  
Oh, a dazzling spectacle  
Attention, let’s make some noise  
The voice of impact is about to rise, loud and clear  
The grand stage is already set  
Hey, a beautiful performance is about to begin, ah  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m trying to look cool, but no, no  
It’s overflowing automatically, instinctively  
On top of the dance floor, let’s go wild  
Da-rat-a-tat-a, warning!  

[Chorus]  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
Banzai, let’s celebrate  
Shout it out, shout it out  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
With emotions soaring, let’s take flight  
Shout it out, shout it out (Ooh)  

[Post-Chorus]  
(Hey, uh) It’s so exciting  
(Hey, ha) Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat (Pull up)  
(Hey uh, wa-wa-wa)  
In full bloom, let’s jump around  

[Verse 3]  
Look at me now  
My heart’s racing, ready to burst  
In a dark, dramatic way (Exotic vox)  
From here to there, let’s play hide and seek  
Releasing those hidden feelings  
(Rationality, adios)  
Let’s go all out (Ay, ay, ay, ay)  

[Verse 4]  
Jabbering away, like a juicy tale  
Like a juice that makes you feel alive  
Can’t hold back, no way  
Before we reach the climax, let’s sway  
Jabbering away, like a juicy tale  
Like a juice that makes you feel alive  
Can’t hold back, no way  
A colorful buffet (No escape)  

[Bridge]  
As you know, in a vivid heartbeat  
I can’t stop anymore  
Rushing with impulse, painting the daybreak  
Yes, let’s break through the silence  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
Dangerous excitement, no holding back  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
Let’s go wild, aa  

[Chorus]  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
Banzai, let’s celebrate  
Shout it out, shout it out  
Na-na, na-na-na  
Ready for my show  
To create a wave of applause, stay  
Forget everything else and shout it out  

[Post-Chorus]  
Ay, woah-oh-oh-oh  
Gathering right and left, rat-a-tat-a-tat (Pull up)  
Let’s go all out (Clap, clap, clap)  
Whatever comes our way, let’s shout it out, shout it out!
