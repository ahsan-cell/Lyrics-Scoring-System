**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
What I remember  
Is your song  
More vivid than our conversations  
Where have you gone?  
I’m always searching for you  
What I remember  
Is your song  
Your face, singing and laughing, is so clear  
It suits you so well  
I want to keep watching you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But what I want to see in the end  
Is surely already in your dreams  
Once more  
Please let me hear it again  
I want to listen  

[Chorus]  
Louder now  
Sing the monster's song  
It still lingers  
The song of dreams  
You always sing  
The monster's song  
It still lingers  
I can’t help but hum along  

[Verse 1]  
What I remember  
Is you being there  
Holding a guitar  
You were there  
I can’t forget you  
So I’ll sing for you  

[Pre-Chorus]  
But what I want to see in the end  
Is surely already in your dreams  
Once more  
Please let me hear it again  
I want to listen  

[Chorus]  
Louder now  
Sing the monster's song  
It still lingers  
The song of dreams  
You always sing  
The monster's song  
It still lingers  
I can’t help but hum along  

[Bridge]  
The past that falls away is so vivid  
The future I want to show is delicate  
To you, who’s insensitive to the passing days  
The past that falls away is so vivid  
The future I want to show is delicate  
To you, who’s insensitive to the passing days  

[Chorus]  
Hey, louder now  
Sing the monster's song  
It still lingers  
The song of dreams  
You always sing  
The monster's song  
It still lingers  
I can’t help but hum along  

[Outro]  
Hey, we  
Reach out on sleepless nights  
Stretching out the nights that won’t sleep again  
Not sleepy yet  
I want to stay in those days  
Unyielding  
Reaching out on sleepless nights  
Stretching out the nights that won’t sleep again  
Not sleepy yet  
Singing on such nights  
The monster's song  
The past that falls away is so vivid  
The future I want to show is delicate  
To you, who’s insensitive to the passing days  
Hey, the past that falls away is so vivid  
The future I want to show is delicate  
To you, who’s insensitive to the passing days
