**Translated Lyrics:**

"My, how time flies," my heart whispered  
When I think about it, "Yeah, it really did."

I spent today just like yesterday,  
Repeating the same things over and over again.

I fought sometimes with "longing" and "ideals,"  
No matter what, we could never get along.  
Fragments of youth passed by,  
But in the end, I couldn't pick them.

I really hate it,  
I hate people so much.  
I even hate friends,  
But deep down, I truly love them.

If tomorrow is sunny, then that's just fine.  
If tomorrow comes, then that's alright.  
If you smile, then nothing else matters.  
The world keeps changing, but that’s enough for me.

"I'm grateful," my heart whispered,  
Even without being told, I understood well.  
I spent today just like yesterday,  
Thinking only about such things.  
There were times with few "tears" or "laughter,"  
But in truth, that wasn't the case at all.  
As spring breathes life, the cherry blossoms don’t dance,  
They simply bask in the sunlight.

I really hate it,  
I hate today so much.  
I hated yesterday too,  
But I love tomorrow dearly.

If someday, someday you find me,  
If someday, someday you can cherish me,  
As long as you’re alive, that’s all that matters.  
As long as I’m living, that’s enough for me,  
That’s all I need.

I really hate it,  
I hate people so much.  
I even hate friends,  
But deep down, I truly love them.
