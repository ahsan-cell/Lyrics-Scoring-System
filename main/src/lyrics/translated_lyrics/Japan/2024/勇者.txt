**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Like a tale from a fairy tale,  
A sign that the end has come.  
From a journey far too long,  
I carve out this single verse.  
Once upon a time in this land,  
Evil cast its shadow here,  
A brief memory of the hero  
Who vanquished it on their quest.

[Drop]  
(Ah-ah, ah)  
(Ah, ah)  
(Ah-ah, ah)  
(Ah-ah, ah)

[Verse 2]  
The story comes to an end,  
The hero drifts into sleep.  
Leaving behind a peaceful life  
In this land they once knew.  
Time flows mercilessly,  
Forgetting those who lived,  
Even the traces of their lives  
Rust away with the years.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Yet still, your (Ah-ah, ah)  
Words, wishes, and courage (Ah, ah)  
Are surely alive within me,  
Even now.

[Chorus]  
It was just a choice we made together,  
But somehow, without realizing why,  
I want to know the reason for the tears  
That fall down my cheeks.  
Even if you’re not there, I’m sure I can find  
The path we walked together.

[Post-Chorus]  
(Right at the end, embarks a new story)  
(Out to learn people in this journey)  
(Story of our days will go on)  
(Forever, ever, ever, as we now walk)

[Verse 3]  
The story continues,  
Setting off on a journey alone.  
In the towns I visit,  
You remain in the memories of others.

[Bridge]  
Still as kind-hearted as ever,  
Always trying to look cool,  
The symbols you left behind  
Are proof of the peace you won.  
So that one day in the future,  
I won’t be alone,  
I’ll have these markers  
To remind me of that journey.

[Interlude]  
(Ah-ah, ey-yah)  
(Ah-ah, ooh-woah)  
(Ah-ah, eh-yah)  
(Eh-eh-yah)

[Verse 4]  
Like a tale from a fairy tale,  
A sign that the end has come.  
An encounter that changed me,  
A journey of one in a hundred.

[Pre-Chorus]  
One day, the wind may carry away your courage,  
And you might fade from everyone’s memory,  
But I will take you with me into the future.  
(I took your hand.)

[Chorus]  
That day, everything began, so trivial,  
It makes me smile just to think of it.  
Those ordinary moments still shine bright,  
I want to know, even now,  
When I look back, you’re always there,  
Gently smiling at me.

[Post-Chorus]  
(Right at the end, embarks a new story)  
(Out to learn people in this journey)  
(Story of the end of hero)  
(Forever, ever, ever, as we now walk)

[Outro]  
The beginning of a new journey  
Is with the life that sprouted  
In this land you protected.
