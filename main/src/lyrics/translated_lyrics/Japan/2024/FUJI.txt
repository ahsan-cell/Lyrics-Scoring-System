**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Number_i

[Verse 1: Yuta Jinguji]  
First, a verse  
Far beyond your imagination, yeah  
Hop on, spit it out  
Taking you on a flight  
To the struggles long past adolescence  
Doesn't matter  
Just you and me on this sound

[Verse 2: Yuta Kishi]  
Where my passion is directed  
Doing as I please, invasion  
This isn’t just a game, it’s life  
So there are struggles, right?  
A handgun can’t change that (Ayy)  
Heading to work today, automation  
It’s amazing that you come to cheer me on

[Pre-Chorus: Sho Hirano, Yuta Kishi & Yuta Jinguji]  
We shake the universe  
The view from the top, a low Mount Fuji  
Every day, I’m too uptight  
Always bound up tight  
Dancing on Africa  
We shake the universe  
The view from the top, a low Mount Fuji  
Every day, I’m too uptight  
Always bound up tight  
Dancing on Africa

[Chorus: Sho Hirano, Yuta Kishi, Yuta Jinguji]  
Don’t miss us in your sight  
In the blink of an eye  
From the depths of your mind  
Pull it out, now on time  
I’m a who? Just wanna dance and rap  
If it feels cramped, break free  
Otherwise, love will never be born

[Post-Chorus: All, Sho Hirano, Yuta Jinguji]  
Flying around, Switch Man  
From speed to speed  
Taking you away  
Where do you want to go? Say "My Honey"  
Goin' rich life  
Everyone sings in peace, say  
La-la-li-la-li-la  
We’re breaking through  
Switch Man  
From speed to speed  
Taking you away  
Where do you want to go? Say "My Honey"  
Goin' rich life  
Everyone sings in peace, say  
La-la-li-la-li-la  
I know, love revolution

[Verse 3: Sho Hirano, Yuta Jinguji, Yuta Kishi]  
From the escalator to the beast path  
Clearing the way, kiss me my baby trill (Trill)  
So I can bring along an incredible number (Woah)  
Strengthening my legs, now I’m coming to see you  
I feel like I’m on a flying ship  
With a Specium Ray, still half-asleep  
There’s no limit, brr brr  
We can go anywhere like this

[Chorus: Yuta Jinguji, Sho Hirano, Yuta Kishi]  
Don’t miss us in your sight  
In the blink of an eye  
From the depths of your mind  
Pull it out, now on time  
I’m a who? Just wanna dance and rap  
If it feels cramped, break free  
Otherwise, love will never be born  
(This Scene  
My Rap Change In World  
Love it, Love it)

[Post-Chorus: All, Yuta Kishi, Sho Hirano]  
Flying around, Switch Man  
From speed to speed  
Taking you away  
Where do you want to go? Say "My Honey"  
Goin' rich life  
Everyone sings in peace, say  
La-la-li-la-li-la  
We’re breaking through  
Switch Man  
From speed to speed  
Taking you away  
Where do you want to go? Say "My Honey"  
Goin' rich life  
Everyone sings in peace, say  
La-la-li-la-li-la  
I know, love revolution

[Outro: Yuta Kishi, Yuta Jinguji]  
Revolution  
Revolution  
It’s too amazing, 27
