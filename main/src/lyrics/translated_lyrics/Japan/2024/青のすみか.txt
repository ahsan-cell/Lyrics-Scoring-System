**Translated Lyrics:**

Wherever I go,  
The season of blue seems to continue on,  
Nothing stands in the way  
Before my eyes, nothing at all.  
Reflecting the asphalt, the cicadas' song,  
The silence that is you fades away (fades away).

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
These days are fading,  
Even if I come to know your scent, so different from mine,  
I’ve forgotten the eternal  
Place where it all began.

**[Chorus]**  
Even now, the blue remains,  
Even now, the blue is still here.  
No prayer or words can  
Bring me closer; they never reached you.  
Like a quiet love,  
Flowing like summer’s colors down my cheeks,  
The words that curse you linger deep in my throat.

**[Post-Chorus]**  
“See you again, right?”  
A voice that cannot be heard.

**[Verse 2]**  
In the afternoon,  
The season of the fading wind,  
We carry our thoughts,  
We were once empty, just a reflection of ourselves.  
We should have been able to share everything,  
Since that day, little by little,  
The curse of being different from you has grown.

**[Bridge]**  
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)  
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)  
The sorrow hidden behind your smile (your smile),  
I overlooked it, drowning in regret (drowning in regret).  
(La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la)  
As the flowers bloom and scatter, I say goodbye to you.

**[Chorus]**  
Even now, the blue remains,  
Even now, the blue is still here.  
No prayer or words can  
Bring me closer; they never reached you.  
Like a quiet love,  
Flowing like summer’s colors down my cheeks,  
The words that curse you linger deep in my throat.

**[Post-Chorus]**  
“See you again, right?”  
A voice that cannot be heard.

**[Outro]**  
Like the countless stars in the galaxy,  
Falling through the gaps between my fingers.
