**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
To you, I’m surely just a friend of a friend,  
If that smile is meant for someone like acquaintance B,  
Then you must be a terrifying person.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t know the black magic to make you fall for me,  
And I lack the courage and the car to take you to the sea.  
But I want to see you waking up next to me,  
Smiling and saying good morning.

[Chorus]  
I want to see you, can you jump out from that corner right now?  
Can you come running to me?  
Taken away by the summer’s monster, back to my side,  
Even if we were born under different stars,  
By chance and the power of summer magic,  
Couldn’t you become mine?

[Verse 2]  
The one who’ll be your lover is probably someone like a model,  
Someone older than you,  
With sun-kissed skin, a fan of Western music.

[Pre-Chorus]  
When you kiss, you’re on your tiptoes,  
You laugh as I stroke your head.  
No, I’m not winning at anything,  
Wait, who is that guy?

[Chorus]  
I want to see you, can you jump out from that corner right now?  
Can you come running to me?  
Taken away by the summer’s monster, back to my side,  
Even if you’re interested in someone else,  
By chance and some kind of abracadabra magic,  
Couldn’t you become mine?

[Bridge]  
Letting myself be swept away by the anxiety in my chest,  
If I run to you, it’s actually me who’s  
Caught up in something like summer magic in a bad way,  
That’s too scary.  
Only thoughts of endings keep coming to mind,  
Under the midsummer sky, trembling,  
I think about you,  
What flavor of ice cream you might like.

[Chorus]  
I want to see you, can you jump out from that corner right now?  
Can you come running to me?  
Taken away by the summer’s monster, back to my side,  
Even if we were born under different stars,  
By chance and the power of summer magic,  
Couldn’t you become mine?
