**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Your voice unravels me,  
My heart says it doesn't want to forget.  
Memories keep piling up,  
I want to be by your side forever.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Is it okay to be a crybaby?  
You don’t have to pretend to be strong.  
Even if our love is limited,  
I’m happy we met.

[Chorus]  
I wish it could last,  
I wish it could last,  
I hope for it to continue endlessly.  
Even if I can’t hold your hand,  
I truly care for you.

[Verse 2]  
Your dreams bring me peace,  
I say I don’t want to wake up.  
Memories keep piling up,  
I want to be by your side tomorrow too.

[Chorus]  
I want you to scold me,  
For being so oblivious.  
I’m still a child,  
Not realizing when the ordinary breaks,  
But I truly care for you.

[Post-Chorus]  
I wish my (your)  
Time could just stop.

[Bridge]  
Look, I find myself hoping again,  
I’ll try to hold back.  
If it overflows,  
Please look into my eyes, look at me, look.  
Only your shadow stretches out,  
Don’t disappear,  
This feeling will never change.

[Chorus]  
I wish it could last,  
I wish it could last,  
I hope for it to continue endlessly.  
Even if I can’t hold your hand,  
I’m embraced by the passing present.

[Post-Chorus]  
I wish my (your)  
Time could just stop.

[Outro]  
Let’s savor today,  
Don’t end,  
Oh summer, don’t end.
