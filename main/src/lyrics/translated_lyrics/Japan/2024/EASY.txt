**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus: Kim Chaewon, Kazuha, Huh Yunjin]  
Even if I get hurt, I walk the path, kiss me  
It’s not easy, but I make it look easy  
On stage, sparks fly, my body  
Pull up and I tear it up like ballet  
Damn, I really make it look easy  
Yeah, you know that I make it look easy  

[Verse 1: Hong Eunchae, Kim Chaewon, Huh Yunjin, Sakura]  
Clap your hands, if you’re like me  
Clap your hands now (Dream, dream, dream)  
Just push aside any doubts  
Just say, "I'm the real one" (Sheesh, sheesh)  
After the lights go out, I wander in the night  
Don't know what is right  
Don't know about my rights  
Jealousy, doubt, mistrust, now they’re friends of mine, yeah  
To the world, I’m a half-hearted seraphim, yeah  

[Pre-Chorus: Kazuha, Sakura, Hong Eunchae]  
Mm, mm-mm, mm  
I've been trying so long to show you, show you, show you (Oh)  
(I'm the one that you need)  

[Chorus: Huh Yunjin, Kim Chaewon, Kazuha]  
Even if I get hurt, I walk the path, kiss me  
It’s not easy, but I make it look easy  
On stage, sparks fly, my body  
Pull up and I tear it up like ballet  
Damn, I really make it look easy  
Yeah, you know that I make it look easy  
Yeah, you know that I make it look easy  

[Verse 2: Kazuha, Sakura, Kim Chaewon, Huh Yunjin]  
Becoming a swan on the surface, whippin'  
Sometimes I lose my footing, but I keep it  
Get, set, go, come and see me, I'm fearless, mm  
Every step I take is history, this is my way  
Walking like a hero even if I’m not flawless  
You thought I just came easily?  
If you didn’t recognize me, you have to know  

[Pre-Chorus: Hong Eunchae, Huh Yunjin & Hong Eunchae, Sakura]  
Mm  
I've been trying so long to show you, show you, show you  
(I'm the one that you need)  

[Chorus: Kazuha, Sakura, Hong Eunchae, Kim Chaewon, *Huh Yunjin*]  
Even if I get hurt, I walk the path, kiss me (Kiss)  
It’s not easy, but I make it look easy (It’s not easy, but I make it look easy)  
On stage, sparks fly, my body (That's my body, that's my body)  
Pull up and I tear it up like ballet (Yeah, yeah)  
Damn, I really make it look easy (Damn, I really make it look easy)  
*Yeah, you know that I make it look easy*
