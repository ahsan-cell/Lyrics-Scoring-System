**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Isn’t it nice to hide quietly in the shadows?  
A flower like a bud is still a flower, isn’t it?  
Keeping it a secret and protecting it feels right,  
Blooming beautifully without anyone's interference.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Don’t get caught up in sweet and bitter,  
That kind of judgment is pointless.  
Don’t let worries bring you down,  
You’re not used to love, don’t dress it up unnecessarily.  
I don’t need a pretty vase or fertilizer,  
Your natural form is beautiful.

[Chorus]  
Become a flower, look, smile with a hint of cynicism,  
I’m thrilled by that face, I can’t look away.  
Taste it, your poison is my remedy,  
I’ll wrap it up for you, so just smile.

[Verse 2]  
Hey, I want to see you, I want to meet you,  
Will you smile if I say I want to see that smile?  
Isn’t it okay to support from the shadows?  
If I could wish for more, I’d love to make you bloom with my own hands.

[Verse 3]  
A flower that devours the heart like a disease,  
I don’t want to let it wither away.  
Even if the light doesn’t reach,  
I’ll keep watering it.

[Bridge]  
It’s about time you realize how wonderful you are,  
Be a little vain and take care of yourself more.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Unconsciously, you’re storing love,  
I don’t need a pretty vase or fertilizer,  
Just bloom proudly in your own way.

[Chorus]  
Become a flower, look, smile with a hint of cynicism,  
I’m thrilled by that face, I can’t look away.  
Taste it, your poison is my remedy,  
I’ll wrap it up for you.  
Relax, your darkness is my light,  
I’ll love you, so just smile.
