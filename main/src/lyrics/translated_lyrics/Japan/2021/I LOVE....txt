**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In the scenery I gaze upon,  
Since you entered, the world has transformed,  
In the midst of days I handled with ease,  
Unable to resist a strange gravity, it crumbles away.  

[Refrain]  
I love, I almost say,  
But then I stop,  
I love, I love, over and over.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
In the rising love, amidst changing feelings,  
Your radiant form shines brightly,  
As if diving into a fishbowl,  
Like melted paint, so irregular.  

[Chorus]  
Alone, I wouldn’t have noticed a thing,  
In such vivid colors,  
To you, who plays it off as normal,  
I was about to say,  
I love, let me send you the rest.  

[Verse 2]  
You laugh at things unseen,  
And here I am, unable to part,  
So beautiful it blinds my eyes,  
Even now, I live bound by inferiority.  

[Refrain]  
I love, I love, an awkward knot,  
I love, I love, finding it by touch,  
I love, your love, untangling and intertwining,  
I keep repeating it, over and over.  

[Chorus]  
A galaxy adorned only with replicas,  
Darkness made from curtains, no one to lament,  
In this mouse-gray city,  
I love, holding onto that proof,  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)  

[Verse 3]  
Joy and sorrow,  
Thoughts without punctuation,  
Rather than sharing completely,  
If we can acknowledge each other,  
Even while struggling with ambiguity.  

[Bridge]  
In overlapping love, amidst murky emotions,  
In the brief moments between blinks,  
The gift you gave me is this,  
A strangely gentle world, so irregular.  

[Chorus]  
Alone, I wouldn’t have noticed a thing,  
In such precious light,  
To you, who plays it off as normal,  
I was about to say,  
I love, let me send you the rest.  

[Outro]  
We receive each other,  
As the nameless night deepens.
