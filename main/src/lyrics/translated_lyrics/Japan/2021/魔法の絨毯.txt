**Translated Lyrics:**

Laughing over silly things,  
Crying in casual conversations,  
I bookmark each little moment,  
So I won’t forget, so I won’t lose them.

Like Aladdin, riding on a magic carpet,  
I’ll come to get you, though I can’t use magic.  
I have no money, no strength,  
No status or honor, but  
I don’t want to let you go.

Even if you happen to build up love,  
Or share laughter with someone else,  
I’ll think about it alone, sinking into my thoughts,  
Spending sleepless nights.  
Even if it rains,  
And I get soaked through,  
I’ll come to get you,  
Laughing and crying,  
Gazing into each other’s eyes, embracing, loving.

Like a genie, coming out of a magic lamp,  
I’ll make you laugh, though I can’t use magic.  
I have no money, no strength,  
No status or honor, but  
I want to protect you.

Like Aladdin, riding on a magic carpet,  
I’ll come to get you, though I can’t use magic.  
I have no money, no strength,  
No status or honor, but  
I want to protect you.

Like a genie, coming out of a magic lamp,  
I’ll make you laugh, though I can’t use magic.  
I have no money, no strength,  
No status or honor at all,  
But I want to protect you.
