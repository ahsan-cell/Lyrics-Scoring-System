**Translated Lyrics:**

How long do you plan to stay  
All alone like this?  
Little by little, I’ve come to hate myself,  
And envy someone else.

Telling myself, "Someday, someday,"  
I’ve loved so much until today,  
And even now,  
I still do.

May this love come to fruition,  
Just a little, just a little,  
Let me feel that way.  
Right now, I’m in love,  
Holding my bare heart.

Goodbye, cherished memories,  
And my dreamy aspirations.  
I’ve learned to be gentle, just a bit,  
And it seems I’ve grown strong too.

I’ve embraced whatever future comes,  
Having crossed many nights until now,  
And even now,  
I still do.

I don’t know where this love will lead,  
I really don’t know.  
But I’ll go convey my feelings,  
So please accept my bare heart.

I thought I shouldn’t have fallen in love,  
Back then, on that night,  
I felt that way.  
But now, I’m in love again,  
Shaking my bare heart.

May this love come to fruition,  
Just a little, just a little,  
Let me feel that way.  
Right now, I’m in love,  
Holding my bare heart.
