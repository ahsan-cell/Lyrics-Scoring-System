**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Maybe it’s better if it’s not me,  
We were two who couldn’t find our way.  
Before I knew it, we were always fighting,  
I’m sorry.  
I’ve wanted to talk for so long,  
It seems we just don’t fit together.  
In this room where it’s just the two of us,  
You were the one doing all the talking.

[Pre-Chorus]  
If someday we meet somewhere,  
Will you laugh about today?  
I can’t even explain the reasons,  
But I hate crying after you fall asleep.

[Chorus]  
Your voice, your face, even your clumsy ways,  
I don’t really hate any of it.  
Like dried flowers,  
The days with you  
Will surely, surely, surely, surely  
Fade away.

[Verse 2]  
Maybe it’s good that it wasn’t you,  
I won’t be made to cry anymore.  
Words like “it’s always me”  
Have disappeared.  
Even such a sad farewell,  
With time, I’ll forget it.  
I wonder if you’re doing well  
Next to someone new.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I don’t want to see your face anymore,  
So please don’t contact me strangely.  
You haven’t changed; it’s still convenient for you,  
But I can’t ignore it, so I reply a little.

[Chorus]  
Your voice, your face, even your clumsy ways,  
I probably still don’t hate them.  
Like dried flowers,  
As time passes,  
They will surely, surely, surely, surely  
Fade away.

[Bridge]  
In the moonlight, shadows sway,  
I must be losing my mind too.  
Colors emerge in the darkness,  
Red, yellow, and blue deep in my heart.  
I keep calling your name,  
The feeling of love begins to bloom again.

[Chorus]  
Your voice, your face, even your clumsy ways,  
I absolutely hate all of it.  
I’ll place a flower that hasn’t withered  
Next to you,  
And hold onto it forever, forever, forever, forever.

[Outro]  
Ah-ah, ah-ah
