**Translated Lyrics:**

Goodbye, thank you, with all my voice  
More important than hatred, there are things to cherish  
I want to convey it to your departing back  
So that I can reach you between warmth and pain  

I thought this would go on forever  
I was drawing this Dio and JoJo  
The ripple that was released still  
Burns hot deep in my chest  

Dio and the others fell from the blazing roof of the mansion  
The goddess of love pierced Dio's back  
Every time a star is born  
Dio will think of JoJo  

Wishing to abandon humanity, he clings  
To the mask as a farewell gift  
(♪～)  
Caught up in nostalgic memories  
Crying out in the cruel "world"  

Overcoming anxiety and fear  
Living to gain a sense of security  
Though I don’t feel fear  
In the bloodline that inherits the golden will  

JoJo's words, JoJo's wishes  
DIO swore to dominate them  
(It’s useless~♪)  
Crumbling under the sunlight  
Time, stop to deliver the final blow  

"The World"  
(♪～)  
Reaching out, I embraced  
Inside the sinking ship  
Shining and fading away for the future  
Surpassing the fate entrusted to me and the promise  

Will I move forward without looking back?  
Will I shout while facing only ahead?  
Harboring ripples in my heart  
Until the distant future…
