**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Rima, Ayaka; Rio, Mako]  
Nothing, if it's a secret, then nothing  
Something, I want to give you something special  
What kind of thing would you like? I just want to see you smile  
That thing, I’ll search for it, just for you  

[Pre-Chorus: Maya, Mayuka]  
Hey, hey, what are you looking at?  
What are you listening to? Are you happy?  
Talk to me, tell me everything  

[Chorus: Riku, Ayaka; Miihi, Mako, Maya, Nina]  
Ooh, I just wanna make you happy  
Oh, I really want to see you smile (Ooh, happy, happy)  
Even the smiles you've forgotten  
It’s okay, we’ll get them back for sure (Ooh, happy, happy)  
When I see your smile, it truly makes me happy  
What do you want? (Want)  
What do you need? (Need)  
Anything, everything  
You, just tell me  

[Verse 2: Rio, Ayaka; Mayuka, Maya]  
Gave me, a beautiful love, gave me  
Held me, holding this small hand  
It's precious, I won’t let you be alone  
Take me, I want to give you all of me  

[Pre-Chorus: Mako, Rima]  
An obvious heart  
A card that’s just for me  
Don’t forget, come close to me  

[Chorus: Riku, Ayaka; Miihi, Mako, Maya, Nina]  
Ooh, I just wanna make you happy  
Oh, I really want to see you smile (Ooh, happy, happy)  
Even the smiles you've forgotten  
It’s okay, we’ll get them back for sure (Ooh, happy, happy)  
When I see your smile, it truly makes me happy  
What do you want? (Want)  
What do you need? (Need)  
Anything, everything  
You, just tell me  

[Bridge: Mako, Rio]  
Tell me like, "Ooh-ah"  
Fancy me, don’t  
Be cold, I’m so hot  
No goodbye, baby, goodbye  
Tell me like, "Ooh-ah"  
Fancy me, don’t  
Be cold, I’m so hot  
No goodbye, baby, goodbye  

[Verse 3: Mayuka, Rima]  
The comfort you give me  
A place to rest, snuggled up together  
Feel the light filling us, always  
Dreaming together  
A completely sweet melody  
It truly heals me, that’s the theory  
Put it on repeat, listen to it forever and ever  
You're my favorite song  

[Chorus: Riku, Ayaka; Miihi, Mako, Maya, Nina]  
Ooh, I just wanna make you happy  
Oh, I really want to see you smile (Ooh, happy, happy)  
Even the smiles you've forgotten  
It’s okay, we’ll get them back for sure (Ooh, happy, happy)  
When I see your smile, it truly makes me happy  
What do you want? (Want)  
What do you need? (Need)  
Anything, everything  
You, just tell me
