**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Ah, just like always,  
I yawn at the passing days.  
Through the bustling night, today again,  
Morning falls over the streets of Shibuya.  
It feels somewhat empty,  
That kind of feeling is dull,  
But that’s okay, it’s just how it is, this is fine.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Unknowingly, I’ve been hiding  
My true voice, let it resonate, look,  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It’s certainly right there.

[Chorus]  
Ah, I draw as I feel,  
In the colors I’ve chosen for myself.  
In the sleepy air of morning,  
A blue world has arrived.  
To say I love what I love,  
It’s terrifying, but I can’t help it,  
I felt like I met my true self.

[Verse 2]  
Ah, the more I reach out,  
The further it goes, today doesn’t go as I wish.  
Once again, I’m struggling in a hurry,  
That frustrating feeling is just pitiful,  
Tears come out, the more I step in,  
It becomes painful, it hurts.

[Chorus]  
Ah, I move forward as I feel,  
On this path I’ve chosen for myself.  
In the heavy-lidded night,  
I cling to my blue vow.  
Continuing to do what I love,  
It’s not just fun,  
I can really do it, but it makes me anxious.

[Verse 3]  
Ah, no matter how many times, look, no matter how many times,  
I’ve drawn because I lack confidence.  
Ah, no matter how many times, look, no matter how many times,  
What I’ve built up becomes my weapon.  
Even if I look around, even if I compare with others,  
What can only I do?  
Even now, I have no confidence, but still…

[Bridge]  
Feelings I’ve never felt before,  
Thoughts I didn’t know, stepping out that day,  
All this pain I felt for the first time,  
By facing what I love,  
I touched a small light still shining.  
It’s okay, let’s go, all that’s left is to enjoy.

[Chorus]  
Ah, I draw everything I have,  
In colors that only I can produce.  
Running through both morning and night,  
I found a blue light.  
Facing what I love,  
It’s still scary even now,  
But I’m no longer that transparent me from that day.  
Ah, just as I am,  
An irreplaceable me.

[Outro]  
Unknowingly, I’ve been hiding  
My true voice, let it resonate, look,  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It’s certainly still there, right there now.  
Unknowingly, I’ve been hiding  
My true voice, let it resonate, come on,  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It’s certainly there inside you.
