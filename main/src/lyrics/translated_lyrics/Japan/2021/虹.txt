**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's okay to cry, just that one phrase  
Saved me, truly, thank you so much  
Though I feel pathetic, though I seem careless  
Just thinking of you makes tomorrow shine  
It's fine for us to be just as we are  
Let’s find a sunny spot and play together  
As you water the plants on the balcony,  
A little rainbow appears at your feet.

[Chorus]  
I’ll be by your side forever, stay by my side forever  
So we won’t ever part, I’ll hold on tightly  
So the knot we’ve tied won’t come undone  
I won’t let go of the hands we’ve firmly joined.

[Verse 2]  
Mom's kindness and Dad's tears  
Are just like us, making the future dear  
It doesn’t have to be a big dream  
It’s enough to just be ourselves  
When you’re lost and all alone  
Remember those days, oh, ah

[Chorus]  
On lonely nights, I want you to share half with me  
On joyful days, I want us to laugh enough  
No words seem sufficient,  
Maybe it’s because I’ve felt your warmth.

[Bridge]  
Thinking of family and friends, and of me like this  
I always cherish them with a smile, it makes me want to cry  
In the empty sky, shining all alone  
I’ve been searching for words to replace “thank you.”

[Chorus]  
I’ll be by your side forever, stay by my side forever  
So we won’t ever part, I’ll hold on tightly  
So the knot we’ve tied won’t come undone  
I won’t let go of the hands we’ve firmly joined.  
I won’t let go.
