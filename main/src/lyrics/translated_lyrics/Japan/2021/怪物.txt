**Translated Lyrics:**

Ah, to the wonderful power, let’s toast once more today  
Even as bullets fly around the room  
This Dio, "immortal" and "invincible," cannot be defeated  
I feel like I'm losing my mind  
The scent of blood, so strong it stings  
Awakens me deep in my nose  
Following instinct, whose turn is it today?  
With this power, what can I do?  
What can Dio achieve?  
Just that golden bloodline  
To ensure Dio is not destroyed  
Ah, wishing for a future, again and again  
I will cling to this fate of blood  
In courage and pride, JoJo must  
Disperse into nothingness  
Fearing nothing anymore  
I want to be strong, strong  
So that Dio can surpass humanity  

The wonderful power is present today as well  
JoJo's ripple won't affect Dio  
It doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, as I grasp his neck  
The rigid carotid artery  
Dyer fought earnestly  
Launching roses infused with ripples, piercing the eye  
Unfading, unfading, the ripples flow  
Useless, useless, it doesn’t work  
Useless—  
JoJo lives purely and rightly  
JoJo lives without causing sadness to anyone  
JoJo lives straight and true without straying  
This is the Monkey JoJo for Dio!  
Is the power of the sun justice?  
Is living by devouring others justice?  
What should Dio truly be?  
What is the real Dio?  
Tell me, please  
Tell me, please  

In this world without answers  
Ah, I wish for it  
To defeat this DIO, that fate  
JoJo's will shall never fade  
The trembling heart shouts, carving blood through  
That faint ripple  

Ah, I will consume your weakness, again and again  
This fate of blood  
In fear and anger, JoJo has  
The parting sky-splitting gaze (Stinging Eyes)  
So that I won’t lose to JoJo anymore  
I want to be strong, strong  
So that Dio can surpass humanity  

Just to defeat JoJo, for that reason  
I live, I live, I live  
To surpass the Dio within Dio
