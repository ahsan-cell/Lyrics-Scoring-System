**Translated Lyrics:**

In this crazy season,  
Just the two of us, alone,  
In the fading evening light,  
Tonight too, we linger on,  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No matter how much I might break down,  
I want to smile in the end,  
For what reason,  
Shall we fight? But our motivation is love, ah.  

[Verse 2]  
New days come,  
Without searching, always here (here),  
I've seen many colors,  
But these eyes shine eternally,  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Though I've lived so long,  
Everything feels like a dream,  
This and that,  
Charming as it is, I still prefer you, ah.  

[Chorus]  
Where have you been? I was searching for you,  
Take me along, take me along,  
I’ll throw away everything,  
No matter where, no matter where,  
Even in this crazy season,  
Amidst the crowd,  
With you, I can just be, just be,  
Both new days and unspoken pasts,  
Everything shines, yeah.  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Verse 3]  
Looking back at what I've lost,  
It drifts away, softly,  
Sometimes it feels distant,  
Just swaying in the wind, gently.  

[Verse 4]  
I've cut off my path,  
But I’ve decided where to go,  
I want to move forward without hesitation, but I have no guarantee,  
It feels like I understand something,  
Yet I understand nothing,  
But knowing that is truly good.  

[Verse 5]  
New days come,  
Without searching, always here, always here, here,  
Ah, I've seen many colors, but these eyes,  
Shine eternally, shine eternally.  

[Bridge]  
Ah, though I've lived,  
Everything feels like a dream,  
This and that,  
Charming as it is,  
I still prefer you,  
Ah, ah, ah, ah.  

[Chorus]  
Where have you been? I was searching for you,  
Take me along, take me along,  
I’ll throw away everything,  
No matter where, no matter where,  
Even in this crazy season,  
Amidst the crowd,  
With you, I can just be, just be,  
Both new days and unspoken pasts,  
Everything shines, yeah.
