**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Grabbed by the collar, I stagger from a fierce punch,  
Hunched over, shoulder to shoulder.  
You smirk at the rain, just as forecasted,  
Lying when you say, "The wounds will heal nicely."

[Pre-Chorus]  
You can’t even manage a proper argument,  
So don’t crack those dull jokes.  
Your utter lack of wit brings tears to my eyes.

[Chorus]  
Time and again, bruised and shedding tears,  
Flowing, flowing,  
As we lean on each other with our unstable hearts (ah),  
Resisting this rotten bad end.

Why is it that the pain feels more comforting than joy?  
It resonates heavily,  
While I click my tongue at my soaked clothes (ah),  
We laugh, looking at each other's swollen faces.

[Post-Chorus]  
On this downpouring night, I vowed for revenge.

[Verse 2]  
I grab back at your collar,  
If I can’t throw a counter punch, I can’t stand by your side.  
No matter who the opponent is, I won’t back down.  
No matter how many times I’m knocked down, I won’t give up.  
I kept telling myself, “Don’t forget, don’t forget,”  
Yet here I am.

[Bridge]  
Why? (Starting over, messing up)  
Why? (Getting through, wanting to break free)  
Why? (Starting over, messing up)  
Why? (Getting through, shoulders drooping)

Ah, I don’t need an umbrella, just give me one word,  
Not a lukewarm kindness,  
But words that pierce deep into my heart, infected with weakness.

[Chorus]  
Time and again, bruised and shedding tears,  
Flowing, flowing,  
As we lean on each other with our unstable hearts (ah),  
Resisting this rotten bad end.

Why is it that the pain feels more comforting than joy?  
It resonates heavily,  
While I click my tongue at my soaked clothes (ah),  
We laugh, looking at each other's swollen faces.

[Post-Chorus]  
On this downpouring night,  
In these days of captivity,  
As if questioning,  
In the light of our shining eyes,  
I vowed for revenge.
