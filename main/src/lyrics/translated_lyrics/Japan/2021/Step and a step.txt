**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: J.Y. Park]  
JYP with NiziU  

[Verse 1: Rio, Mayuka]  
It's okay, just as you are  
Rest assured, you're not late at all  
When you find yourself lost on the way  
Just stop and take a look around  
Take your time, oh yeah  

[Pre-Chorus: Nina, Ayaka, All]  
Ooh, look back behind you  
See your footprints there  
Always, I'm proud of you  
Ooh, you're already special  
So you should be proud of yourself  
Let's go  

[Chorus: Mako, Riku]  
Step by step, at my own pace  
Step by step, in my own rhythm  
It's okay to go slow, it's okay to take a break  
Just walk on, being true to yourself  
Just believe in yourself  

[Post-Chorus: Maya, Miihi]  
Everything will be fine (Be fine)  
Everything will be okay (Be okay)  
Everything will be fine (Be fine)  
Everything will be okay (Be okay)  

[Verse 2: Rima, Nina]  
No matter the time, by your side  
You always give me a gentle smile, my friend  
Even when I feel a bit lonely  
If you reach out your hand  
Take my hand, oh yeah  

[Pre-Chorus: Maya, Ayaka, All]  
Ooh, stumbling was just  
Because you were moving forward  
Always, I'll be with you  
Ooh, the mirror shines bright  
Showing the real you  
Let's go  

[Chorus: Mako, Riku]  
Step by step, at my own pace  
Step by step, in my own rhythm  
It's okay to go slow, it's okay to take a break  
Just walk on, being true to yourself  
Just believe in yourself  

[Bridge: Maya, Nina]  
Feel the wind touching your cheeks  
Close your eyes, and if you listen closely, you'll see  

[Verse 3: Rima, Mayuka]  
Don't get lost, come on, don't worry, believe in victory  
You'll be okay, just because no one is watching  
Your future is yours alone, it's never too late  
Even if it's one step at a time, keep moving, are you ready?  
It's fine if there's no easy shortcut  
You'll create tomorrow with your own hands  
So that one day, your smile can shine bright, even now  

[Chorus: Mako, Riku]  
Step by step, at my own pace  
Step by step, in my own rhythm  
It's okay to go slow, it's okay to take a break  
Just walk on, being true to yourself  
Just believe in yourself  

[Post-Chorus: Miihi]  
Everything will be fine (Be fine)  
Everything will be okay (Be okay)  
Everything will be fine (Be fine)  
Everything will be okay (Be okay)
