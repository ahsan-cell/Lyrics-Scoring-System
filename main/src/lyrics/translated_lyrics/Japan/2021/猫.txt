**Translated Lyrics:**

In the interrupted waves, I’m about to say something  
Holding back the words that spill out, hold on, yeah  
The last train has already left  

The moon's shadow makes me honest  
Blaming everything on summer  

I’ll ignite a fire in you, summer, summer night  
If you want an unending thrill,  
Just trust your hand in mine  
I’ll never let you down  
A summer, summer night where I can’t grow up  
I want to see the continuation of this night,  
So let’s run barefoot  
I’ll never let you down  
Burning summer night  

A model for my right hand’s strumming!! Cat/DISH// U-FRET  

Once you wander in, there’s no turning back  
Casting away control, the sound of my pounding heart  

Rising desire, I can’t hide it anymore  
Just surrender completely  
So baby, give me a chance  
You might also like, wrapped in the hot wind,  
I just want to be by your side until morning  

I’ll ignite a fire in you, summer, summer night  
If you want an unending thrill,  
Just trust your hand in mine  
I’ll never let you down  
A summer, summer night where I can’t grow up  
I want to see the continuation of this night,  
So let’s run barefoot  
I’ll never let you down  

Burning summer night  
(Summer night, summer night)  
Burning summer night  
(Rising desire, I can’t hide it anymore)  
Burning summer night  

I’ll ignite a fire in you, summer, summer night  
If you want an unending thrill,  
Just trust your hand in mine  
I’ll never let you down  
A summer, summer night where I can’t grow up  
I want to see the continuation of this night,  
So let’s run barefoot  
I’ll never let you down  
Burning summer night  
(Summer night, summer night)  
Burning summer night
