**Translated Lyrics:**

For instance, even if right now your eyes are filled with tears,  
I can no longer hear your calling voice.  
Like paint dissolving, our days together blur in my memories.  

If I seek something, something else slips away,  
In this world we live in.  

Like that flower waiting for the spring breeze,  
If you are the light that shines,  
Beyond the cycles of fate,  
I will make bloom the flowers of love, a bouquet.  

If wishes can come true, I want to live in our world once more,  
Those days that sprouted from that kiss.  
The sky-blue petals have forgotten their scent, and my feelings for you are wilting away.  

In this heart that seems about to scatter, let me remember the beauty of love I’ve just learned,  
Hey, let it bloom.  

Like that flower waiting for the spring breeze,  
If I could stay with an unadorned heart,  
Even if I can't touch you,  
Even if I’m troubled by my thoughts,  
I won’t forget.  

If you are the light that shines,  
Beyond the cycles of fate,  
I will make bloom the flowers of love, a bouquet.
