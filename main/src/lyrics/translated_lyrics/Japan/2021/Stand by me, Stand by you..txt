**Translated Lyrics:**

Today, I decided to sleep  
After seeing your sleeping face,  
But before I knew it, I was asleep in your arms.  

As I wave goodbye saying, "I’m off,"  
You always flash a peace sign.  
Hmm, it seems I just can’t win against you.  

I’ve been searching for this all along,  
No more hesitation, let’s start from here.  

This is a story of one in 7.5 billion,  
Two people meet and fall in love,  
And then, as if it’s the most natural thing, they kiss.  
It’s a common tale,  
One is a clumsy man,  
And the other is a spirited princess.  
The man says, "I was born to meet you."  

Baby, stand by me,  
I will stand by you.  

Usually pretending not to care,  
I love how you unexpectedly praise my work.  
With this, I feel like I can strive for a lifetime.  
You also find me slacking off unnoticed,  
And I love how you scold me for it.  
Hmm, it seems impossible to ever win against you.  

I’ve longed for this,  
Finally holding onto this happiness, I won’t let go.  

This is a story of one in 7.5 billion,  
Two people meet and fall in love,  
Become a family, deepen their love, and grow old together.  
It’s a common tale,  
One is a clumsy old man,  
And the other is an eternal princess.  
They say, "Even if we’re reborn, let’s be together again."  

This is a story of one in 7.5 billion,  
Two people meet and fall in love,  
And then, as if it’s the most natural thing, they kiss.  
It’s a common tale,  
One is a clumsy man,  
And the other is a mischievous princess.  
The man says, "I was born to meet you."  

Baby, stand by me,  
I will stand by you.  
Baby, stand by me,  
I will stand by you.  
Baby, stand by me.
