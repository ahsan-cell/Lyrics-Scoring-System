**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain]  
Wanna, wanna, wanna  
Take a picture now, take a picture now (Ayy)  
Gonna, gonna, gonna  
I’ll capture this moment  
Wanna, wanna, wanna  
Take a picture now, take a picture now (Ayy)  
Gonna, gonna, gonna  
Let’s remember it  

[Verse 1]  
I want to tell you  
I love being held by you, so much  
All the love I have  
I’ll give it to you, oh, forever  
I'll never let go  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I got this feeling  
Right now, my heart is racing  
It runs through my whole body  
When we’re together, I feel like I can fly  
Let’s embrace every single moment  

[Chorus]  
One for our love  
Two for our youth  
Three for these precious memories  
Four for your smile  
Five, right now we’re young and wild  
Let’s remember it forever  

[Refrain]  
Wanna, wanna, wanna  
Take a picture now, take a picture now (Ayy)  
Gonna, gonna, gonna  
I’ll capture this moment  

[Verse 2]  
The feeling from you  
The feeling from me (Wanna, wanna)  
I want to give it  
Wanna give it to you  
When you give it to me  
I’d do anything for you, surely  
I'll never let go  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I feel alive, I love the feeling of being close  
It’s almost burning with passion  
When we’re together, you make me feel so right  
Let’s celebrate every single moment  

[Chorus]  
One for our love  
Two for our youth  
Three for these precious memories  
Four for your smile  
Five, right now we’re young and wild  
Let’s remember it forever  

[Bridge]  
Whenever I look at you  
What I feel is Hmm-ah  
I say la la, when I’m with you  
Take a pic, take a pic, feeling like a merry-go-round  
Just gazing at you  
That alone makes me go ooh-ahh  
I want to remember everything we do  
Light up the flashlight, hey, let it pop  

[Verse 3]  
In tough times, in sad times, I’ll be by your side  
Never worry and believe me  
I won’t leave you lonely  
Tomorrow is uncertain  
But I want to take that chance  

[Chorus]  
One for our love  
Two for our youth  
Three for these precious memories  
Four for your smile  
Five, right now we’re young and wild  
Let’s remember it forever  

[Refrain]  
Wanna, wanna, wanna  
Take a picture now, take a picture now (Ayy)  
Gonna, gonna, gonna  
I’ll capture this moment  
Wanna, wanna, wanna  
Take a picture now, take a picture now (Ayy)  
Gonna, gonna, gonna  
I’ll capture this moment
