**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You all just want to categorize everything,  
Classify, distinguish, and label by genre.  
Humans have this instinct to sort things out, or so they say,  
You claim there are two types of people in this world,  
Those who have it and those who don’t,  
Those who do things right and those who don’t.

[Verse 2]  
Introverts and extroverts?  
You can’t seem to settle down unless you classify.  
Why not peek outside your unaware instincts?  
Not feeling it?  
In other words, it’s not that simple,  
It’s more ambiguous and delicate,  
An unclear something.

[Verse 3]  
For instance, those who have but can’t show it,  
Those who are doing it but can’t get it right,  
Pretending to be wise while having it,  
And in the midst of acting cool, they become anxious.  
After all, you’re gifted,  
While I’m just an ordinary housewife,  
Isn’t that fine?  
Isn’t that wonderful?  
Isn’t it the completion of proving the impossible?

[Pre-Chorus]  
I’m not saying you should hold onto dreams,  
I won’t be that irresponsible.  
Just don’t let that instinct consume you,  
Every time you throw away that habit,  
Your true value becomes clearer.

[Chorus]  
We’re animals too,  
This kind of thing is our favorite.  
What do you think after hearing all this?  
Usually, it bubbles up from deep within.  
We’re animals too,  
Thus we possess our original instincts.  
Don’t classify yourself,  
Show me how to break that bad habit.

[Post-Chorus]  
Show me how to break that bad habit.

[Verse 4]  
I’m going to say something I shouldn’t as an adult,  
But preaching is honestly a pleasure.  
If it’s a side dish for drinking, it’s a masterpiece.  
And if it helps you move forward,  
Then that’s a win-win, right?  
But that’s also a bit disappointing.  
Ultimately, it’s up to you,  
And after that, I really don’t care.

[Verse 5]  
What do you want to do from here?  
Being asked that by someone,  
I want to believe it’s not the end,  
But if it isn’t, it’s quite an emergency.  
You’re all smoldering in that categorized,  
Ordinary box,  
While I’m on easy mode in life,  
Sleeping there until I’m in my thirties.

[Verse 6]  
I’ve always had low specs,  
So I struggled, flailed, and howled ugly.  
If I were to categorize my past,  
It would be obvious to anyone.  
The world quickly reduces it to money, love, luck, fate,  
Why simplify it to just two characters?

[Pre-Chorus]  
We’re much more ambiguous,  
Complex, and unclear.  
Don’t pretend to be wise and get arrogant,  
You don’t have the ability to classify yourself.

[Chorus]  
We’re animals too,  
This kind of thing is our favorite.  
What do you think after hearing all this?  
Usually, it bubbles up from deep within.  
We’re animals too,  
Thus we possess our original instincts.  
Don’t classify yourself,  
Show me how to break that bad habit.

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]  
We’re animals too,  
This kind of thing is our favorite.  
What do you think after hearing all this?  
Usually, it bubbles up from deep within.  
We’re animals too,  
Thus we possess our original instincts.  
Don’t classify yourself,  
Show me how to break that bad habit.

[Post-Chorus]  
Show me how to break that bad habit.
