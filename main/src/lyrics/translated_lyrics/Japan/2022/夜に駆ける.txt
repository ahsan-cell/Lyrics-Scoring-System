**[Intro]**  
Wrapped in the sinking JoJo,  
In this bizarre fate meant for just the two of us.  
(Hmm, hmm!)  
(Indeed! What a refreshing feeling!)  
(I feel like singing a song, it’s such a good mood~)  
(8 seconds passed!)  
(How about you, Jotaro?)

**[Verse 1]**  
It was just "Ora Ora,"  
With that one word, everything came to an end.  
As the sun began to rise, DIO grew anxious,  
Absorbing Joseph's blood (the Ripple and all).  
From the day we first met,  
DIO's fate was sealed.  
Somewhere, JoJo was fleeting yet brave, reckless too,  
With gentle eyes (that’s you, Jonathan Joestar).

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Always in overdrive,  
With the rhythm of the Ripple, no matter how many times,  
The Ripple flows through the fists that touch, DIO's body  
Feels like it's about to crumble.  
Even in this strange friendship of two as one (JoJo!)  

**[Chorus]**  
Golden spirit, flowing bloodline,  
Imagining the most gruesome deaths possible,  
Before the rising sun fades away,  
Here comes the road roller (the road roller!).  
Even if I stop time (The World),  
Or blind you (this blood-blinding is!).  
If your Stand can still move,  
It means nothing until the sun rises.  
I will endure.

**[Interlude]**  
(Humans live to overcome anxiety and fear to find peace.)  
(To gain fame or to dominate others,)  
(The pursuit of peace is humanity's purpose.)

**[Verse 2]**  
Only JoJo can do this,  
There’s no substitute for DIO's body (it fits so well).  
Are you coming at me? Fine.  
Come closer.  
Next is Jotaro.  
(It’s you.)  
With a similar type of ability,  
Perhaps because I inherited Jonathan's blood,  
Let’s compare the speed of our rushes,  
This DIO must win.  
Yet still, surely this DIO will activate "The World,"  
Time has stopped.  
10 seconds passed.

**[Interlude]**  
(I believe overcoming "fear" is)  
("Living.")  
(Those who stand at the top of the world!)  
(Are those who hold not even the tiniest "fear"!)  
(Do you understand, Enya?)

**[Bridge]**  
Useless, useless, clashing "Ora Ora,"  
You crush DIO's legs, thrown out recklessly.  
Useless, useless, useless, useless, throwing punches,  
Deep down, you already realize.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Ah, look again, "Star Platinum" (Ora!)  
No matter how many times I take it (I’ve caught you!),  
With this rush, it seems cracks are forming in this DIO's body.  
DIO, who should be immortal,  
For the first time, felt fear.

**[Chorus]**  
Golden spirit, flowing bloodline,  
This DIO's ambitions will be shattered.  
Like melting into the rising sun,  
My body gradually disappears.  
I will drain your life,  
Purifying your tainted ambitions.  
Jotaro watches DIO fade away,  
Overlaying JoJo's shadow.  
Wanting to kill, hating JoJo,  
Feeling this strange friendship,  
This bizarre fate meant for just the two of us,  
With the morning sun,  
The trembling heartbeat (it trembles),  
This DIO will  
Be defeated by JoJo.
