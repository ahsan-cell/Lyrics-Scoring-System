**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The fireworks we were supposed to see together  
Fill the gaps of the night  
I get lost in sentimentality,  
So I closed Twitter.  

[Verse 2]  
The camera I placed on the shelf  
I want to keep my distance from it now  
Today, I lost everything  
And cried all day long.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I still don’t really understand  
What my true feelings are,  
But you must have erased  
All of me from your album.  

[Chorus]  
Like a shutter falling down,  
I cut you out and fell in love,  
Quietly storing everything  
In the album of my heart.  
So, you see, so, you see,  
I remember your gestures and scent,  
I wish I had touched you  
When the shutter clicked.  
I should have spent all my time just on you.  

[Verse 3]  
The usual date spots  
And the familiar words of love,  
Only the pretty moments  
Were left on Instagram.  

[Verse 4]  
There are things that can’t be captured  
By the camera on the shelf,  
Between you and me,  
And I didn’t realize it.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Even now, I still don’t really understand,  
But all of me in your album  
Must be unnecessary.  

[Chorus]  
Like a shutter falling down,  
I cut you out and fell in love,  
Not wanting to break anything,  
I surely let it pass by.  
So, you see, so, you see,  
I must have been poorly framed,  
I wish I had touched you  
When the shutter clicked.  
I should have spent all my time just on you.  

[Bridge]  
No matter how beautiful and precious  
Those jewel-like memories are,  
If I’m not there, if you’re not there,  
They mean nothing at all.  

[Chorus]  
Like a shutter falling down,  
I cut you out and fell in love,  
Not wanting to break anything,  
I surely let it pass by.  
So, you see, so, you see,  
I must have been poorly framed,  
I wish I had touched you  
When the shutter clicked.  
Like a shutter falling down,  
I cut you out and fell in love,  
Quietly storing everything  
In the album of my heart.  
So, you see, so, you see,  
I remember your gestures and scent,  
I wish I had touched you  
When the shutter clicked.  
I should have spent all my time just on you.
