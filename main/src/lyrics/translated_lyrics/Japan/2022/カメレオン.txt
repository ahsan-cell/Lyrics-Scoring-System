**[Intro]**  
I want to uncover  
What I can't reach  
Your true self is  
A labyrinth,  
A complex mystery.  
Changing hearts, changing colors,  
You transformed so lightly,  
In a sunset that's painfully beautiful—  
Who is this you I don't know?

**[Verse 1]**  
The express train rushed by,  
At the desolate station platform, the cold wind blew through.  
I couldn't find you anywhere,  
And as time passed, the screen showed you,  
But you were already someone I didn't know.  
You smiled so happily,  
And I couldn't help but smile back.

**[Chorus]**  
Again and again,  
Again and again,  
I paint over it,  
With white paint over  
The stained sadness,  
Ruining everything,  
Even the nights I threw away—  
The canvas still gets colored,  
Tears blur like sudden rain.

**[Verse 2]**  
Both the you in my memories  
And the you now are both real,  
The vibrant you,  
Is now a color I don’t recognize.

**[Breakdown]**  
Again and again,  
Again and again,  
I paint over it,  
Any color that suits you now,  
I don’t mind at all.  
This feeling I want to convey,  
Even that seems out of reach,  
If I speak it, it’s just simple bravado,  
Even if I'm not beside you.

**[Chorus]**  
I want to uncover  
What I can't reach,  
Your true self is  
A labyrinth,  
A complex mystery.  
Changing hearts, changing colors,  
You transformed so lightly,  
In a sunset that's painfully beautiful—  
Who is this you I don't know?
