**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I was gazing at something in the sky,  
You told me it was a star.  
Just like us, it’s nestled close,  
We weave our laughter and tears into it.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Countless times, hundreds of clashes,  
Years and years, the light from long ago,  
When even the stars have forgotten,  
It still reaches us.

[Chorus]  
We find each other, pulling together under the same sky,  
Shining brightly, just the two of us, we promised.  
Far away, the endless Betelgeuse,  
A magic that connects to someone.  
Side by side, hand in hand, we move forward,  
Even in tough times, we swore not to cry.  
Far away, the endless Betelgeuse,  
You can see it too, our prayers.

[Verse 2]  
Every time I trace back my memories, you come alive,  
Always being there for me,  
Just like the light of the stars,  
Today, we weave our laughter and tears into it.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Countless times, hundreds of clashes,  
Years and years, the light from long ago,  
When even I have forgotten,  
It still shines upon us.

[Chorus]  
We find each other, pulling together under the same sky,  
Shining brightly, just the two of us, we promised.  
Far away, the endless Betelgeuse,  
A magic that connects to someone.

[Bridge]  
How far, how long can we live?  
Every time you feel anxious, I put on a brave face.  
It’s okay, I’m right here beside you,  
Let’s connect the invisible lines.

[Chorus]  
We find each other, pulling together under the same sky,  
Shining brightly, just the two of us, we promised.  
Far away, the endless Betelgeuse,  
A magic that connects to someone.  
Side by side, hand in hand, we move forward,  
Even in tough times, we swore, just the two of us.  
Far away, the endless Betelgeuse,  
You can see it too, our prayers.

[Outro]  
I was gazing at something in the sky,  
You told me it was a star.
