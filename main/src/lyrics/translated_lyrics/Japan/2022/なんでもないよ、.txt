**Translated Lyrics:**

I feel like I have nothing, it’s really getting to me now  
Not even my best lines or a special appearance  
What you gave me isn’t love or happiness  
But the most ordinary moments and a smile that fits right in  

Was it okay to be with me? Was I good enough for you?  
I won’t ask that, because it was you I wanted  
That’s just my intuition  

A bond of hearts that transcends the body  
A connection so deep that words get in the way  

It’s not about wanting to see you, or wanting to be close, or wanting to protect you  
It’s simply that I don’t want you to die before me  
And it’s not even that, oh, I should have just kept quiet  
“It’s nothing,” it really is nothing  

I feel like I have nothing, but that’s not quite true  
Your genuinely angry face and your carefree sleeping face  
Surely, these eyes will reflect them the most in the future  
And I’ll be the one who hears your big laughter more than anyone else  

A bond of hearts that transcends the body  
A connection so deep that words get in the way  
You might also like wanting to see you, or saying I won’t let go, don’t leave me  
It’s not about that  
It’s not just that, oh, what was I trying to say?  
“It’s nothing,” it really is nothing,  
I like the me that’s with you.
