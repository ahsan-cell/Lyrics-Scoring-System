**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Ah, just like always,  
I yawn at the passing days.  
Through the bustling night once more,  
Morning falls on the streets of Shibuya.  
There’s a feeling that seems empty,  
Such a feeling, it’s so dull.  
But that’s okay, it’s just how it is, this is fine.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Unknowingly, I’ve been hiding  
The true voice within me, let it resonate, look—  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It’s certainly right there.

[Chorus]  
Ah, I draw as I feel,  
In the colors I’ve chosen for myself.  
In the sleepy air of morning,  
A blue world has arrived.  
To say I love what I love,  
It’s terrifying, but I can’t help it.  
I felt like I met my true self.

[Verse 2]  
Ah, the more I reach out,  
The further it goes; today doesn’t go as I wish.  
Once again, I’m struggling in haste,  
That frustrating feeling is just pitiful.  
Tears fall, the more I step in,  
It becomes painful, it hurts.

[Chorus]  
Ah, I move forward as I feel,  
On this path I’ve chosen for myself.  
In the heavy-lidded night,  
I cling to my blue vow.  
Continuing to do what I love,  
It’s not just fun, you know.  
I can really do it, though it makes me anxious.

[Verse 3]  
Ah, no matter how many times, look, no matter how many times,  
I’ve drawn because I lack confidence.  
Ah, no matter how many times, look, no matter how many times,  
What I’ve built up becomes my weapon.  
No matter who I compare myself to,  
What can only I do?  
Even now, I have no confidence, yet still…

[Bridge]  
Feelings I’ve never felt before,  
Thoughts I didn’t know, stepping out that day,  
This pain I felt for the first time, all of it,  
By facing what I love,  
I touched a small light still shining.  
It’s okay, let’s go; now it’s just about enjoying.

[Chorus]  
Ah, I draw with everything I have,  
In colors that only I can produce.  
Running through both morning and night,  
I found a blue light.  
Facing what I love,  
It’s still scary even now,  
But I’m no longer that transparent me from that day.  
Ah, just as I am,  
An irreplaceable me.

[Outro]  
Unknowingly, I’ve been hiding  
The true voice within me, let it resonate, look—  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It’s certainly still there, right there.  
Unknowingly, I’ve been hiding  
The true voice within me, come on,  
Even if I pretend not to see,  
It’s certainly there inside you.
