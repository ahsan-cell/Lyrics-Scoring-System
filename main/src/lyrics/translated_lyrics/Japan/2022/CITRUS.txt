**Translated Lyrics:**

Stealing away the heat,  
The scent of the alleyway  
Made me forget who I was  
Until yesterday.

Throwing away both the sour and sweet,  
Even if buried in the mundane,  
The happiness that exists here  
Is irreplaceable.

Even if I’m pointed at and laughed at,  
I’ll pursue my path without fading.  
If you’re lost between right and left,  
Just fly straight ahead.

I’ve decided not to let go,  
I said I want to protect you.  
Only the true strength  
Is what I want to find,  
And now I have no lingering feelings at all.

Even the weeds growing randomly  
Are grasping freedom.  
Each future blooms proudly,  
When I’m with you, oh.

Caught up in the citrus scent,  
It feels like my heart is tightly gripped.  
I can smile better  
Than we did back then,  
Having even forgotten how to worry,  
With a proud affection.

Sniffing around aimlessly,  
Rather than living in fear of someone,  
In a world where there’s no up or down,  
Let’s embrace it all.

I’ve decided not to let go,  
I said I want to protect you.  
Only the true strength  
Is what I want to find,  
And now I have no lingering feelings at all.

On a runway smoldering with impatience,  
Unable to move,  
If I’m sinking while falling behind,  
Then take to the sky, oh.

So that kindness doesn’t overflow,  
No matter what happens, I’ll stay the same.  
I’ve decided not to let go,  
I said I want to protect you.  
Only the true strength  
Is what I want to find,  
And now I have no lingering feelings at all.

Even the weeds growing randomly  
Are grasping freedom.  
Each future blooms proudly,  
When I’m with you.
