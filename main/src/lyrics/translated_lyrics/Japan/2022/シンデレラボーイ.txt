**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Even if I understand with my head,  
My heart can't keep up.  
My body is so simple,  
Especially for a man, oh.  
Every night I sway and drift,  
Yet you’re still the one I loved most,  
The worst yet my favorite,  
I wonder why, it makes me mad,  
Already.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want to forget,  
But I've been hurt all along,  
Even though it was always like that.

[Chorus]  
Cinderella Boy, as midnight strikes,  
Don’t make me cry in your arms.  
Pretending not to notice, just like that,  
I absolutely hate the cigarettes you light.  
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.

[Verse 2]  
A wet bath towel hanging,  
At eight in the bathroom,  
Alone in this messy room,  
Once again, I let my body give in.  
Even if you’re gone,  
I seem to be okay.  
I’ll contact you sometimes,  
Let me be a little mean, okay?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
At least tell a lie properly,  
Next time, I have to play it better.

[Bridge]  
Show your weakness only in front of me,  
Call me with that innocent face.  
I wanted to monopolize your gaze,  
Just wanted no one else to see.  
(Die)

[Chorus]  
Cinderella Boy, as midnight strikes,  
Don’t make me cry in your arms.  
Pretending not to notice, just like that,  
I absolutely hate the cigarettes you light.  
Don’t say you love me when you don’t,  
Capturing me deep in your eyes,  
Pretending not to notice, just like that,  
I was deceived willingly.  
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.
