**Translated Lyrics:**

Piercing through this heart,  
Even the unreliable me, if someday  
I could become someone,  
Without reason,  
Tears threaten to overflow,  
Filling the night  
With a shining dream.  

♪  
My white breath, so fragile,  
Melted away in the winter's chill.  
The warmth of our hands intertwined  
Feels too weak to rely on.  
Spring always comes,  
As if it’s a given,  
To welcome us back,  
That’s what I believed back then.  
When I close my eyes,  
I always thought dreams  
Were true dreams back then.  
If you desire it,  
I can fly anywhere,  
Even the timid me, if someday  
I find the meaning of life,  
Love and hate,  
Connected together,  
Will become a dream  
So wild it never wakes.  

♪  
We’ll escape the freezing night sky,  
If I gently drape a warm coat over you,  
You were always there,  
As if it was a given,  
That’s what I believed back then.  
No matter how much  
The rain of memories seeps into old wounds,  
If you desire it,  
Piercing through this heart,  
Even the unreliable me, if someday  
I could become someone,  
Without reason,  
Tears threaten to overflow,  
Filling the night  
With a shining dream.  

♪  
Diving through the sea of memories,  
Picking up fragments of love,  
Inside you, always,  
A dazzling world softly, oh, yeah.  
Even if this love, like a curse,  
Gradually, gradually  
Erodes this body,  
From the depths of my heart,  
You overflow out,  
Seeking each other, intertwining,  
Beyond that, we become a dream.  

♪  
If you desire it,  
Piercing through this heart,  
Even the unreliable me, if someday  
I could become someone,  
Without reason,  
Tears threaten to overflow,  
Filling the night  
With a shining dream.  
Whether it’s a true dream or a false one.
