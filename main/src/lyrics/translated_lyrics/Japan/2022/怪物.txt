**Translated Lyrics:**

Ah, to the wonderful power, let’s toast once more today  
Even as bullets fly around the room  
This Dio, who is "immortal" and "invincible," cannot be defeated  
I feel like I'm losing my mind  
The scent of blood, so strong it stings  
Awakens me deep in my nose  
Following my instincts, whose turn is it today?  
What can I do with this power?  
What can Dio do?  
Just that golden bloodline  
To ensure Dio is not destroyed  
Ah, I wish for a future, again and again  
I will cling to this fate of blood  
In courage and pride, JoJo  
I want you to disappear  
I fear nothing anymore  
I want to be strong, strong  
So that Dio can surpass humanity  

The wonderful power is present today as well  
JoJo's ripple won't affect Dio  
It doesn’t work, it doesn’t work, as I grasp his neck  
The rigid carotid artery  
Dyer fought seriously  
Launching roses infused with ripples, piercing the eye  
It won’t disappear, it won’t disappear, the ripples are flowing  
Useless, useless, it doesn’t work  
Useless—  
JoJo lives purely and rightly  
JoJo lives without making anyone sad  
JoJo lives straight without going astray  
The Monkey JoJo for this Dio!  
Is the power of the sun justice?  
Is living by devouring others justice?  
What should Dio truly be?  
What is the real Dio?  
Tell me, please  
Tell me, please  

In this world without answers  
Ah, I’m wishing  
To defeat this DIO, that fate  
JoJo's will shall never fade  
The trembling heart shouts, carving blood into sound  
That faint ripple  

Ah, I will consume your weakness, again and again  
This fate of blood  
In fear and anger, JoJo  
With the parting sky-splitting eyes  
So that I won’t lose to JoJo again  
I want to be strong, strong  
So that Dio can surpass humanity  

Just to defeat JoJo, for that reason  
I live, I live, I live  
To surpass the Dio within DIO
