**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In a world like nuts packed in a bag,  
Everyone is snuggling up with someone they’ve met.  
We, who have slipped in there, are like peanuts,  
Pretending to be nuts, wearing smiles on our faces.

[Pre-Chorus]  
On the template of happiness,  
Behind the literal picture-perfect facade,  
Even when we gather around the table and join our hands,  
We can’t truly be ourselves.

[Chorus]  
Full of secrets, patched together home, you know?  
Even if I chew it down, the truth gets stuck in my teeth.  
Full of anxiety, living life as it comes, and I know,  
Though it’s a day-to-day existence filled with pretense,  
Here I am, and here you are.

[Post-Chorus]  
Just this truth alone  
Makes my stomach feel heavy.

[Verse 2]  
Like a single peanut with its skin peeled away,  
In an instant, I get rejected by the world; it’s in those moments  
If it’s okay to be imperfect, let me stay by your side.  
Roasted together, swayed, even trampled,  
I’ll become like a shell that doesn’t crack.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The only difference is whether we were born in the trees or in the ground.  
May the rain equally dampen this world, so dry it feels unforgiving.

[Chorus]  
Sometimes cold and noisy beyond the window, you know?  
It’s okay to have days filled with thunder where not a single star can be found.  
Full of mistakes, an improvised show, but I know,  
After all, it’s just a piece of everyday life,  
So let’s swallow it down and sleep on it.  
Full of secrets, patched together home, you know?  
Eating everything without leaving behind any favorites or ready-made meals,  
There’s no such thing as normal, no right answers in this life, and I know,  
Though it’s a day-to-day existence filled with pretense,  
Here I am, and here you are.

[Post-Chorus]  
Just this truth alone  
Makes my stomach feel heavy, woah.  
I’ll savor this handful of miracles  
As I chew it down.
