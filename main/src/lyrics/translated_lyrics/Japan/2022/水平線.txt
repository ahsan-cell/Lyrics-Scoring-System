**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
As much as possible, let there be no lies,  
So that I can always be gentle,  
When someone feels pain,  
I want to feel it as if it were my own.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Though I encounter sadness in losing  
One truth to another truth,

[Chorus]  
On a morning where the horizon shines,  
Your hopes crumble and fall,  
In the fragments carried by the wind,  
Someone whispers that they are beautiful.  
Singing with a sorrowful voice,  
Eventually drifting to the sea, shining,  
You will see it.

[Verse 2]  
Since you can't see your own back,  
It's okay to ask others without feeling shy.  
Because the heart is invisible to anyone,  
It's better to cherish what matters more than what is seen.

[Pre-Chorus]  
As days overlap,  
There may be people you can no longer meet,

[Chorus]  
On a night so translucent and pale,  
One of your dreams comes true,  
Amidst cheers and applause,  
Someone's scream is hidden.  
While searching for reasons to endure,  
Carrying many answers and struggling,  
You will come to know yourself.

[Bridge]  
Even on a day when nothing remains in anyone's heart,  
Or nothing is burned into memory,  
In the midst of noise and footsteps,  
I am here, shouting.

[Chorus]  
On a morning where the horizon shines,  
Your hopes crumble and fall,  
In the fragments carried by the wind,  
Someone whispers that they are beautiful.  
Singing with a sorrowful voice,  
Eventually drifting to the sea, shining,  
You will see it.  
You will see it.
