**Translated Lyrics:**

Chains carved by sunlight,  
Only ashes left behind.  
As if to leave hope in the shadows,  
Transcending the reasons of time.  
We weave our will so it won’t break,  
My heart echoed with a burning pulse.  
Embracing all—light, anger, pain,  
If we’re not judged, then let us judge.

Oh stars, resound beyond time’s veil,  
Stained with the blood tide,  
Reaching even distant histories,  
Let your echoes ring.  
Playing the waves, who do you wish to protect?  
In this uncertain fate,  
Know that no matter how dark the feelings,  
No matter how long the lineage,  
It’s all in vain—  
The remnants.

A thousand nights waiting for a white star,  
When the sun sinks, there’s no escape.  
The endless green, defeated by silver,  
It’s the crimson fire that truly stirs.  
Even the purple, the aged fool,  
Will crawl through decay,  
Betting everything on the light of the stars we’ve spun.  
I didn’t come this far just to run away, did I?

Let time go, like a burning nature,  
If it lights up the gaps of darkness,  
Scatter at the end of this overly vague “world.”  
With hearts trembling, igniting pulses,  
A faint bloodline resonates.  
No matter how deep the regret,  
No matter how solid the gold,  
Be ashamed and die.

The remnants.
