**Translated Lyrics:**

One last time,  
Hold me tight,  
After that, I need nothing more.  
If my future,  
My past, everything,  
Is filled with you,  
I’ll have no regrets.

Carving proof of life,  
My trembling heart shakes,  
I don’t need a scale,  
Confusion clouds my mind.

Justice and evil,  
They sway so easily,  
I was rushing through life.  
The end credits,  
Surely it’s God’s  
Selfish prank.  
Even if I play the villain,  
I won’t mind.

Full of contradictions,  
We’re both the same,  
Comparing tales of misfortune,  
Hanging by a thread,  
Struggling at the edge,  
It feels so insincere.

Deliver, deliver, as blood circulates,  
I gaze at you with single-minded devotion,  
No reason is needed.

Unaware of the tears’ reason,  
Love has torn through my body.  
Don’t wield righteousness,  
Facts have devoured reason.

To keep my heartbeat steady,  
I’ll stoke the fire amidst the noise.  
Even setting up a curtain  
Feels like a lack of grace.

Now, let’s look forward to the next life,  
Shine, sparkle, at lightning speed,  
I’ll head straight towards you,  
With no intention of holding back.

Deliver, deliver, as blood circulates,  
I love you with single-minded devotion,  
Eternity isn’t necessary.

One last time,  
Hold me tight,  
After that, I need nothing more.  
If the unseen future,  
And the unerasable past,  
Are filled with you,  
I’ll have no regrets.  
One last time,  
Lend me your strength,  
After that, I need nothing more.  
My future, my heart, my body,  
I’ll give them all to you.  
Everything, everything.
