**Translated Lyrics:**

[Refrain]  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  

[Verse 1]  
The laundry's empty today, what a lucky day  
Goodbye to those greasy stains, they’re on their way  
Who is it, who is it, calling out in my mind?  
Singing about wanting this and that, all intertwined  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want to be happy  
I want to live with ease  
I want to grasp tightly  
In your heart, if you please  

[Chorus]  
Fill me up with happiness  
Let’s go until we rest in peace  
Even the hell I once saw has its charm  
Spread love around  
Tell me you love me, bring me down  
Take it all away, just laugh, my honey  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
I feel like I’m forgetting something  

[Refrain]  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  

[Verse 2]  
Bubbles pop at 4443, it’s a fizzy escape  
Life’s hungry twists make me want to break  
“Every rain must stop,” so hand me that umbrella  
I want this, I want that, I want it all, but it’s all just a fella  

[Bridge]  
I want to be happy  
I want to live with ease  
I want to turn everything upside down  
I want to erase it all, please  
In your heart, if you please  

[Chorus]  
Fill me up with luck  
Let’s go until we rest in peace  
In a heaven that only welcomes the good  
I can’t seem to find my place  
Tell me you love me, bring me down  
Take it all away, just laugh, my honey  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
I feel like I’m forgetting something  

[Post-Chorus]  
Happy, lucky  
Hello, baby  
I want to be good, but that’s so boring  
Happy, lucky  
Hello, baby, so sweet  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
I feel like it’s all going great  

[Refrain]  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
Effort, future, a beautiful star  
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
