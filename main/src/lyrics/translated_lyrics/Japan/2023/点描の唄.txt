**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Your voice melts away my worries,  
My heart says it doesn’t want to forget.  
Memories keep piling up,  
I want to stay by your side forever.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Is it okay to be a crybaby?  
You don’t have to pretend to be strong.  
Even if our love is fleeting,  
I’m happy to have met you.

[Chorus]  
Forever and ever,  
I wish it could last.  
Even if I can’t hold your hand,  
I truly care for you.

[Verse 2]  
In your dreams, my heart finds peace,  
I say I don’t want to wake up.  
Memories keep piling up,  
I want to be by your side tomorrow too.

[Chorus]  
No matter how far,  
No matter how far,  
I want you to scold me for being so oblivious.  
I’m still a child, not realizing  
When the ordinary falls apart,  
But I truly care for you.

[Post-Chorus]  
If only my (your)  
Time could just stop.

[Bridge]  
Look, I find myself hoping again,  
I’ll try to hold back my feelings.  
If they spill over,  
Please look into my eyes, look at me, look.  
Only your shadow stretches out,  
Don’t disappear,  
This feeling will never change.

[Chorus]  
Forever and ever,  
I wish it could last.  
Even if I can’t hold your hand,  
I’m embraced by the passing present.

[Post-Chorus]  
If only my (your)  
Time could just stop.

[Outro]  
Let’s savor today,  
Don’t let it end,  
Oh summer, don’t let it end.
