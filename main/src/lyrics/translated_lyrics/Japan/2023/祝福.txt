**Translated Lyrics:**

Floating far away, a star in the sky  
As you drift into a deep sleep, my dear  
The future you choose, the path you desire  
No matter where it leads,  
We’ll live together.

[Verse 1]  
Always, in memories of the past,  
On this planet, you’ve been brought here,  
Continuing to wish.  
If only I could dive into  
The distant shimmering scenery.

[Pre-Chorus]  
In a lonely world,  
I pray and wish,  
Drawing dreams,  
Seeing the future.  
If you chose to move forward  
Rather than run away.

[Chorus]  
It’s not an image drawn by someone else,  
It’s not a stage chosen by anyone else.  
This is our story that we’re creating,  
I won’t let you be alone.  
Someday, hidden in your heart,  
The blade will break the chains.  
Always, ah,  
I’ll fight alongside you.

[Verse 2]  
Destiny that has been decided,  
Let’s break that apart.  
We are not puppets on strings;  
It’s your world, your future,  
You can create any story.

[Verse 3]  
To hide as if to escape,  
Riding on this rocket ship,  
The crying you is no longer here,  
Before I knew it, I’ve become so strong.

[Bridge]  
This is your life,  
(Not belonging to anyone else.)  
There’s no answer to that,  
(The path you choose yourself.)  
The curse is now lifted,  
From the fixed fiction that was set,  
I’m taking off,  
I’m soaring high, ah.

[Chorus]  
At a speed that no one can catch,  
Kicking off the ground, dancing in the sky.  
The cursed future,  
You will change with your own hands.  
By moving forward without running away,  
There are surely many things to grasp.  
You can become even stronger.

[Outro]  
Being born on this planet,  
Continuing to live in this world,  
So that I can love all of that,  
With all my heart, ah, blessings to you.
