**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
"In a frozen heart, I want the sun,"  
And "I thought I could be that position for you."  
I was tangled in such an arrogant assumption,  
I'm sorry (I'm sorry), just smile (just smile) and carry on.

[Verse 2]  
I realized the coldness and cruelty of positivity,  
So intense it feels like it could burn.  
What I truly want to give you is something cooler yet warm.

[Refrain]  
It’s not just pretty words, but something beautiful and unwavering,  
Something that warms the depths of my heart rather than just the surface.  
I have ideals, but no matter where I search in my heart,  
It feels like I can’t find it at all.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want to convey, but it doesn’t reach you; this absurdity now  
Tightly binds me down,  
Every little move I make, my cowardly self.

[Chorus]  
Words are like snowflakes,  
Even if I want to gift them to you,  
The more I get lost in thought,  
The more they crumble and melt away,  
Disappearing into nothing.  
But the words I choose,  
The feelings entrusted within them,  

[Post-Chorus]  
I can’t give up on making your heart tremble,  
Until love reaches you more than just saying "I love you,"  
Please wait just a little longer.

[Verse 3]  
Even standing beside you in thin clothes,  
I end up sweating unnecessarily,  
No matter what, I’m lukewarm and might hurt you.

[Refrain]  
"If your palms are hot, your heart must be cold, right?"  
Don’t say such cruel things, even as a joke.  
I could say it, but even if I risk my whole life,  
Please let me turn it around properly.

[Pre-Chorus]  
To save you = to be saved,  
This equation now  
Gently peels away  
My rigid theoretical armor,  
The excessive wrapping of pride.

[Chorus]  
I want kindness more than correctness,  
And the one who can receive it  
Shouldn’t be just anyone like an illumination,  
But should be you, just one person.

[Bridge]  
Trying to mend the cracks with the words I’ve spoken,  
With too much heat added,  
The curtains were drawn back.  
I want to stack up these failed attempts,  
Layer upon layer,  
Until I find someday  
The perfect word or phrase.

[Chorus]  
Words are like snowflakes;  
Even if I gift them to you,  
As time passes, most of them  
Will spill from memory and melt away,  
Disappearing. But still,  
Like subtitles accompanying our story,  
When I recall it,  
When I glance unexpectedly.

[Post-Chorus]  
I want to keep searching for what makes your heart tremble,  
Until love reaches you more than just saying "I love you,"  
Please wait just a little longer.

[Outro]  
On nights frozen in sadness,  
When I don’t want anything at all,  
I find myself thinking about you,  
Even as the snow melts, it remains.
