**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Hanni]  
This song is about you, baby  
Only you  
You, you, you  
You, you, you, you  

[Verse 1: Haerin, Minji, Danielle]  
When I'm struggling, feeling like I might cry (Mm-hm)  
When I can't find the strength anymore (Mm-hm)  
It's you, worrying about me, it's you, making me smile  
You don't have to say a word, boy, what do you say?  

[Pre-Chorus: Hyein, Danielle, Minji, Haerin]  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
No matter how far, you'll come running  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
You show up without pretending to be busy  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
Does this even make sense? I ask  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
You know, he's the one that's living in my system, baby  

[Chorus: Hanni, Danielle]  
Oh my, oh my God, I expected this  
I was really hoping that he would come through  
Oh my, oh my God, it's only you  
Asking all the time about what I should do  

[Post-Chorus: Haerin, Hyein, Hanni]  
No, I can never let him go (Ooh)  
You're all I think about, twenty-four (Ooh)  
I'm really lucky, I truly am (Ooh)  
I know, I know (Ooh)  
Before I knew you (Ooh)  
Everything was meaningless (Ooh)  
My heart has no end (Ooh)  
I know, I know, I'm going crazy, right?  

[Verse 2: Minji, Danielle, Hanni]  
Wherever I am, however many times  
Thereâ€™s nothing else I would hold on to  
I hear his voice through all the noise  
Don't let go of my hand, even for a moment, no, no  
There's no worry  
'Cause I got someone  
Even if I'm alone, it's okay  
'Cause I love someone  

[Pre-Chorus: Hyein, Hanni, Danielle, Minji]  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
No matter how far, you'll come running  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
You show up without pretending to be busy  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
Does this even make sense? I ask  
(They keep on asking me, "Who is he?")  
You know, he's the one that's living in my system, baby  

[Chorus: Hanni, Danielle]  
Oh my, oh my God, I expected this  
I was really hoping that he would come through  
Oh my, oh my God, it's only you  
Asking all the time about what I should do  

[Post-Chorus: Haerin, Hyein]  
No, I can never let him go (Ooh)  
He's right there for me, twenty-four (Ooh)  
I'm really lucky, I truly am (Ooh)  
I know, I know (Ooh)  
Before I knew you (Ooh)  
Everything was meaningless (Ooh)  
What should I do?  
My heart is glowing, it's glowing  
My heart is glowing up so I can't sleep at night
