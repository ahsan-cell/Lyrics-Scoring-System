**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Even if I understand with my head,  
My heart can't keep up.  
My body is so simple,  
Especially for a man, oh.  
Every night I sway and drift,  
Yet you’re still the one I loved most,  
The worst yet my favorite,  
I wonder why, it drives me mad,  
Enough already.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I want to forget, but  
I've been hurt all along,  
Even though it was always like that.

[Chorus]  
Cinderella Boy, as midnight strikes,  
Don’t make me cry in your arms.  
Pretending not to notice, just stay like this,  
I absolutely hate the cigarette you light.  
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.

[Verse 2]  
A wet bath towel hanging,  
At eight in the bathroom,  
Alone in this messy room,  
Once again, I let my body give in.  
Even if you’re gone,  
I seem to be okay.  
I’ll reach out sometimes,  
Just let me be a little mean, okay?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
At least tell a lie properly,  
Next time, I have to play it better.

[Bridge]  
Show your weakness only in front of me,  
Call me with that innocent face.  
I wanted to monopolize your gaze,  
Hoping no one else would see.  
(Just die)

[Chorus]  
Cinderella Boy, as midnight strikes,  
Don’t make me cry in your arms.  
Pretending not to notice, just stay like this,  
I absolutely hate the cigarette you light.  
Don’t say you love me when you don’t mean it,  
In the depths of your eyes, capture me.  
Pretending not to notice, just stay like this,  
I was deceived willingly.  
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh.
