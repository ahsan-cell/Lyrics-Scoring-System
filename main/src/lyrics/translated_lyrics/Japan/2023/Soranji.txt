**Translated Lyrics:**

I was born to meet you,  
And now I want to convey,  
I am just,  
I am still.

The morning of beginnings arrives,  
Searching for treasures,  
But before I know it, it’s right beside me,  
I forget and float through today.

Memories are proof of the path I've walked,  
This scar teaches me so,  
As everyone moves forward as if it’s natural,  
I’m trying my best to keep up.

Swimming through life while getting dirty,  
Well, how well you've cherished this far,  
You've carried it all with you.

I’m not gone yet,  
This tiny hope,  
I want to believe somehow,  
I want you to believe too.

Even if betrayal continues,  
Even if what’s “precious” breaks,  
I want to live somehow,  
I want you to live.

Incredibly,  
It’s truly endless,  
So precious that there’s no waste,  
We are invaluable.

The loneliness has no worth,  
Snow will eventually melt away,  
While flocks of birds take flight towards tomorrow,  
I’m still shrinking today.

Swaying gently,  
I hear the sound of a newborn cry,  
Spring repeats itself,  
Did you cherish it and pass it on?

I haven’t conveyed yet,  
Today’s “I love you,”  
May I deliver it unchanged in the future.

On the day this world ends,  
Let’s plan for tomorrow,  
That’s how we’ll live,  
Let’s try living.

Incredibly,  
It’s truly endless,  
So precious that there’s no waste,  
We are invaluable.

On the ground I tread,  
Irony overlaps,  
Incredibly,  
It’s truly endless.

You mustn’t erase yet,  
This tiny hope,  
Believe without hesitation,  
I want you to believe.

Even if darkness continues,  
I want to keep searching for you,  
So please live,  
I want you to live.

Incredibly,  
It’s truly endless,  
In this swirling world,  
I might be curled up.

Just like everyone has some weakness somewhere,  
So precious that there’s no waste,  
We are invaluable.  
Just take it step by step,  
Please love this ordinary day.

Even the core that’s been torn apart,  
Will bloom flowers towards tomorrow,  
I want to be connected.
