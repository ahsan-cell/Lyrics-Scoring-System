**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**  
The new era is this future  
If we could change everything in the world, change it all  

**[Verse 1]**  
Let’s erase the nuisances and distractions  
Let’s metamorphose this world  
Music, the magic you awaken  

**[Verse 2]**  
When I close my eyes, the future unfolds  
So that it never ends, I sing this song  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Do you wanna play?  
A real game, like a tightrope walk of melodies  
Unrecognized, unable to return, wanting to forget, let me stay in this dream  
I wanna be free  
I can see the new era beyond this world  
Come on, let’s go, new world  

**[Chorus]**  
The new era is this future  
If we could change everything in the world, change it all  
So that endless music reaches even more  
I’ll show you my dreams, you spoke to me  
“Believe in me”  

**[Interlude]**  
Ooh  

**[Verse 3]**  
Let’s get rid of unnecessary things  
Let’s color the real world with vibrance  
Music, the live show is about to begin  

**[Verse 4]**  
Let’s all escape with our eyes closed  
I’ll show you something better than now  
If we can sing this song  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Do you wanna play?  
A real game, like a tightrope walk of fate  
Unrecognized, unable to return, wanting to forget, let me stay in this dream  
I wanna be free  
I can see the new era beyond this world  
Come on, let’s go, new world  

**[Chorus]**  
The new era is this future  
If we could change everything in the world, change it all  
So that endless music reaches even more  
I’ll show you my dreams, I’ll show you my dreams  
It’s the new era  

**[Interlude]**  
Ooh  

**[Outro]**  
It’s the new era
