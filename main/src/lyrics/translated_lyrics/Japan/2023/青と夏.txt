**Translated Lyrics:**

A cool breeze blows,  
The scent of blue skies,  
Today, shall we just take it easy?

The wind chimes ring,  
Sunflowers in yellow,  
I thought it didn’t concern me,  
But I was wrong.

Summer has begun,  
The signal is clear,  
“It hurts and tires me,” but that’s alright,  
Where will the next love lead?  
This isn’t a movie,  
Who’s the main character?  
This isn’t a movie,  
It’s our turn now.

A gentle breeze blows,  
The sunset whispers “See you again,”  
I know it’ll end someday,  
But for now, let’s enjoy.

The wind chimes ring,  
Spitting watermelon seeds,  
Maybe it does concern me after all.  
Friends’ lies,  
Love that gets tossed around,  
What can I really trust anymore?  
Even as we grow up,  
Our treasures won’t fade away,  
It’s okay,  
For now,  
Let’s dive into the blue.

Summer has begun,  
I’ve fallen in love,  
I’m tired of waiting, but how about you?  
The more serious I get, the harder it feels,  
It’s not peaceful,  
This is my love.

This is my love.

It’s lonely,  
Yeah, it’s really lonely,  
Will I forget someday?  
Even so,  
I seek “connections,”  
Believing in the beauty of people,  
Fate is moving us along,  
The red thread makes a sound,  
You are the main character.  
Summer has begun,  
How about you?  
Do you have the courage to be honest?  
Where will this love lead?  
This isn’t a movie,  
These are precious days.

Love has begun,  
The signal is clear,  
What a wonderful day I’ve been waiting for!  
This summer can’t end just yet,  
This isn’t a movie,  
It’s your turn now.  
This isn’t a movie,  
It’s our blue.

This isn’t a movie,  
It’s our summer.
