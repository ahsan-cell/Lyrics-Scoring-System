**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
I really understood,  
That it was something wrong, I knew it all along.  
Everything slipping through my hands looked like love,  
The words I confirmed took shape, just swaying.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Strumming, drawing, surely, that’s all it is,  
How boring, matching the right answers.  
I was so close to understanding,  
Drink it down, throw it up, let’s forget it all.  
With my true feelings wrapped in water, reflecting in the mirror,  
If we could gaze and meet.

[Chorus]  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
In these helpless days,  
I want to dream a dream with poor resolution.  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
Sweet deception,  
Don't stop the music, darling.

[Verse 2]  
Do you really understand?  
That it was something wrong, do you know?  
Maybe only time passes, filled with endless questions,  
Without a chance to make excuses, I just end up bare.  
Surely, it keeps piling up, always,  
Wishing it would just end, suddenly,  
Like that sweet fruit rotting away, we’re breaking apart.  
So let’s dance, sleep, and forget it all,  
Next to you, wearing a mask of lies,  
If we could gaze and meet.

[Chorus]  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
I want to understand,  
I hate those awkward, poorly timed lies.  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
I want to understand,  
Two steps from (hell) with me, darling (ah, ah, ah, oh yeah).

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
In these helpless days,  
I want to dream a dream with poor resolution.  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
Sweet deception,  
Don't stop the music, darling.  
Overdose, just the two of us,  
I don’t understand,  
But even if it’s an awkward, poorly timed lie,  
How about it, just the two of us, sweet deception?  
Don't stop the music, darling.

[Outro]  
Don't stop the music, darling.
