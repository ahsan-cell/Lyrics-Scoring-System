**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The fallen leaves in the park are dancing,  
Teaching me how to fly.  
Thank you for your kindness,  
If only I could be  
As light and carefree as that.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Confiding my worries to a cat that crossed my path,  
Ah, I find myself longing to see you.

[Chorus]  
What words, what wishes, what scenery  
Could bring a smile to your face and fill you with happiness?  
There’s no map, but I’ll walk and search,  
Hoping to hand it to you.

[Verse 2]  
The difference between chance and fate  
Is written on your face.  
The meaning of life is wrapped up  
In the candy you once gave me.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Touching the things that float around you,  
Ah, what can I create?

[Chorus]  
All these trivial and uncertain resolutions  
Shape the patterns of my world.  
It may not be stylish, but in its unique clumsiness,  
I hope it makes you smile.

[Bridge]  
You within me,  
Me within you,  
Surely we’re not the same, but…

[Pre-Chorus]  
The sound of the bakery by the station  
And the closing of the crossing gate,  
Ah, I find myself longing to see you.

[Chorus]  
What words, what wishes, what scenery  
Could bring a smile to your face and fill you with happiness?  
There’s no map, but I’ll walk and search,  
Hoping to hand it to you.

[Outro]  
Turning the journey and time into a bouquet,  
Hoping to hand it to you.
