**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Straying from the herd, I clutched a dream  
I felt it would be the last time, it seemed  
The beast scattered (scattered) a handful of sand (sand)  
I felt it would be the last time, it seemed  

[Chorus]  
I’ll make this uncertain dream come true on the promised night (Whoa, whoa)  
I’ll wish on the faint breeze in the quiet morning (Whoa, whoa)  
The boy from a distant star  
Holds the promise in his arms  
Still in the midst of the journey, in the enchanting garden (Whoa, whoa)  

[Verse 2]  
Towards the fading tracks that disappeared  
I felt it would be the last time, it seemed  
If I weave the wounded dream anew  
I felt it would be the last time, it seemed  

[Chorus]  
Kicking up the hot sand, I resist before the promise (Whoa, whoa)  
There’s no lifeline on this circus night (Whoa, whoa)  
Still in the midst of the journey  
Accelerating to that place even more  
The chandelier after the rain, in the enchanting garden (Whoa, whoa)  

[Refrain]  
Swish da ignite you!  
Swish da ignite you!  
Swish da ignite you!  
Swish da ignite you!  

[Verse 3]  
Lost in confusion, smash  
Dribble trapper, are you kidding me now? (Whoa, whoa)  
Lost in confusion, smash  
Dribble trapper, are you kidding me now? (Whoa, it’s all good)  
Coyote steals the sound  
Coyote steals the pass  
Coyote steals the sound and pass  

[Refrain]  
Swish da ignite you  
Swish da ignite you  

[Outro]  
Pass code a "Penetrator"  
Bass! Bebop!  
Get triple! Buzz up the beat! (Whoa, whoa)  
One love and mercy!  
Bebop! Heat check!  
Vasco da Gama beat! (Whoa, whoa)  
Pass code a "Penetrator"  
Bass! Bebop!  
Wanna buzz up the beat!  
Just wanna buzz up the beat!  
In my mind, an empty lot, extra pass  
Kooazadonihabi (Whoa, whoa)  

[Refrain]  
Swish da ignite you  
Swish da ignite you
