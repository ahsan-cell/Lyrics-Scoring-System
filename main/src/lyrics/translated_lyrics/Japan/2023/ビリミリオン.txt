**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
An old man said to you,  
"Let me buy the rest of your life,  
I'll pay 5 billion for 50 years."  
He wants to start life anew.

[Verse 1]  
Just waking up, eating, working,  
Sleeping, waking, working every day.  
Yet I don’t want to let go,  
I thought about why that is.  
My body might start to ache,  
And I’d probably lose all my friends.  
I wouldn’t be able to love,  
At that price, it’s not worth selling.

[Chorus]  
The time I’m living now  
Is worth more than 5 billion, right?  
Just being alive is a huge gain,  
What more could I possibly want?

[Verse 2]  
The old man said to you,  
"Then I’ll offer double, 10 billion,  
I’ll throw in a wife and kids too."  
"I’ll include a mansion and a job as well."  
If 50 years cost 10 billion,  
That makes me a billionaire with an income of 2 billion a year.  
But I want to find someone I love myself,  
So I don’t need that.

[Chorus]  
The time I’m living now  
Is worth more than 10 billion, right?  
Just being alive is a huge gain,  
I like this moment where I can be anything.

[Bridge]  
You can dream any dream you want,  
You can love however you wish.  
The infinite possibilities  
Are something I won’t give up.

[Chorus]  
No matter how many times I stop,  
I still won’t give up on myself.  
The reason I live  
Is something I decide.

[Post-Chorus]  
The time we live  
Is never something cheap,  
So I want you to choose without regrets.

[Outro]  
Let’s do our best, let’s do our best, keep going.  
Let’s do our best, let’s do our best, keep going.  
Let’s do our best, let’s do our best, keep going.  
Let’s do our best, let’s do our best, keep going.
