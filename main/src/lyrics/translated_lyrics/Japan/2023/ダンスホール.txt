**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
It's always okay  
This world is a dance hall  
Because you're here, I can learn about love again  
I can sing "I love you"

[Verse 1]  
Unbeknownst to me, someone is there  
And I'm relying on it too much  
Somewhere, surely there's someone  
Who resents me

[Pre-Chorus]  
Sighing out, breathing in, and exhaling  
I might miss out on happiness  
But it's probably quite common  
To overlook what's right at your feet

[Chorus]  
It's always okay  
This world is a dance hall  
Because you're here, I can learn about love again  
Look, the sun rises today too  
A dance hall where the times turn  
Sadness never runs out, but  
Let's try counting our happiness

[Verse 2]  
You, who chase your dreams  
Sometimes seem to lose confidence  
No matter what anyone says  
Just be yourself, that's enough

[Pre-Chorus]  
Your mental state will have growing pains  
"Be yourself without pushing too hard"  
If you could do that, you wouldn't be troubled  
Well, let's smile tomorrow for sure

[Chorus]  
In the end, it's okay  
This world is a dance hall  
I want to search for love with all my might by your side  
Today, I'll get scolded again  
The holes in my feelings just keep popping up  
Clumsy, but I’ll smile so you can smile too

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]  
It's always okay  
This world is a dance hall  
Those who enjoy win in this dance hall  
The sun rises again  
A dance hall where the times turn  
Even if my legs get tired, I’ll keep dancing

[Outro]  
In the end, it's okay  
This world is a dance hall  
A dance hall where you are the star  
You know? That smile is my only sun  
A dance hall for you to laugh  
I will keep singing this love
