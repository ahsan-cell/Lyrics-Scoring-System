**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Erased by the Boeing,  
Let me hear it clearly,  
The deliberately vast ocean,  
Over a hundred failures,  
Even Darwin would shed a tear,  
A unique foundation of evolution.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I won’t forget that day,  
In the center of a droplet asteroid.

[Chorus]  
If I just flow along, let myself be swept away,  
Should I resist with my beautiful fins?  
There were nights when everything fell apart,  
But I want to be true to myself.

[Verse 2]  
Caught off guard by the surprising turn,  
I brace my wobbly legs,  
Taking a sip of cold water,  
Though my worries have surpassed their limits,  
I’ve learned to live like this,  
Grasping the tricks of survival.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Thank you for keeping my secrets,  
You can let go now, no need to hold back.

[Chorus]  
If I just flow along, let myself be swept away,  
Should I outsmart them with my beautiful fins?  
Even when we’re separated, I won’t lose sight,  
So I can think of you.

[Bridge]  
I know I can’t keep up this tough facade forever,  
But I still want to paint a world that’s kind.

[Chorus]  
If I just flow along, let myself be swept away,  
Should I resist with my beautiful fins?  
There were nights when everything fell apart,  
But I want to be true to myself.
