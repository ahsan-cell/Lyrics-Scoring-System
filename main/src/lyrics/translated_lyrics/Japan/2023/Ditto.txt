**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Hyein]  
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Hoo-ooh, hoo  

[Chorus: Hanni]  
Stay in the middle  
Like you a little, don’t want no riddle  
Tell me, say it back, oh, say it, ditto  
Morning is too far away, so say it, ditto  

[Verse 1: Haerin, Danielle]  
I’ve grown up so fast  
Like the memories we shared  
My heart when I see you  
Has already passed from summer to autumn  
I’ve been waiting all this time  
Do you want somebody?  
Like I want somebody?  
You smiled at me, but  
Do you think about me now, yeah?  
All the time, yeah, all the time  

[Pre-Chorus: Hyein, Hanni]  
I got no time to lose  
After my long day, I miss you  
Ra-ta-ta-ta, my heart beats (Ra-ta-ta-ta)  
I got nothing to lose  
I like you, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh  
Ra-ta-ta-ta, my heart beats (Ra-ta-ta-ta)  
But I don’t want to  

[Chorus: Haerin, Minji]  
Stay in the middle  
Like you a little, don’t want no riddle  
Tell me, say it back, oh, say it, ditto  
Morning is too far away, so say it, ditto  
I don’t want to  
Walk in this maze  
Even if I don’t know everything, just as I hoped  
Tell me, say it back, oh, say it, ditto  
I want you so, want you, so say it, ditto  

[Verse 2: Danielle]  
Not just anybody  
I imagined you  
Always feeling close  
Just like that first feeling, I’m still  
I’ve been waiting all this time  

[Pre-Chorus: Hyein, Haerin]  
I got nothing to lose  
I like you, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh  
Ra-ta-ta-ta, my heart beats (Ra-ta-ta-ta)  
But I don’t want to  

[Chorus: Hanni, Minji]  
Stay in the middle  
Like you a little, don’t want no riddle  
Tell me, say it back, oh, say it, ditto  
Morning is too far away, so say it, ditto  
I don’t want to  
Walk in this maze  
Even if I don’t know everything, just as I hoped  
Tell me, say it back, oh, say it, ditto  
I want you so, want you, so say it, ditto  

[Outro: Hyein]  
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh  
Hoo-ooh, hoo
