**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
What I remember is your song,  
Clearer than our conversations.  
Where have you gone?  
I’m always searching for you.  
What I remember is  
Your song,  
Your face laughing as you sing is vivid.  
It suits you so well,  
I want to keep watching you.

[Pre-Chorus]  
But what I want to see in the end  
Is surely already in your dreams.  
Once more,  
Please let me hear it again,  
I want to listen.

[Chorus]  
More,  
Make noise, the monster's song,  
It still lingers,  
Singing the song of dreams.  
You always  
Sing the monster's song,  
It still lingers,  
I can’t help but hum along.

[Verse 2]  
What I remember is  
You were there,  
Holding a guitar,  
You were there.  
I can’t forget,  
So I’ll sing for you.

[Pre-Chorus]  
But what I want to see in the end  
Is surely already in your dreams.  
Once more,  
Please let me hear it again,  
I want to listen.

[Chorus]  
More,  
Make noise, the monster's song,  
It still lingers,  
Singing the song of dreams.  
You always  
Sing the monster's song,  
It still lingers,  
I can’t help but hum along.

[Bridge]  
The past that falls away is vivid,  
The future I want to show is delicate.  
To you, who’s insensitive to the passing days,  
The past that falls away is vivid,  
The future I want to show is delicate.  
To you, who’s insensitive to the passing days.

[Chorus]  
Hey, more,  
Make noise, the monster's song,  
It still lingers,  
Singing the song of dreams.  
You always  
Sing the monster's song,  
It still lingers,  
I can’t help but hum along.

[Outro]  
Hey, we  
Reach out on sleepless nights,  
Stretching out the nights that won’t sleep again.  
Not sleepy yet,  
I want to stay in such days.  
Unyielding,  
Reaching out on sleepless nights,  
Stretching out the nights that won’t sleep again.  
Not sleepy yet,  
Singing on such nights,  
The monster's song.
