**Translated Lyrics:**

With a voice overflowing from my heart,  
I sing a melody, turning towards the future.  
Your voice, bursting forth,  
Resonates beneath the deep blue sky.

It’s not a dream, it’s not a dream, the footprints of tears,  
It’s not a lie, it’s not a lie, a smile covered in mud.  
It’s not a dream, it’s not a dream, I want to shout while we embrace,  
Let our feelings reach out!

It doesn’t have to be a miracle, it doesn’t have to be beautiful,  
Because that thing called purpose shines bright.  
An unbreakable battery, as long as my soul endures,  
I’ll just burn this fate and let loose.

The silence lingered in my earphones,  
As I drifted away from my own weakness towards the future.  
On nights when I was irritated by lyrics saying,  
“It’s okay” or “Hang in there,” those moments were tough.

It’s not a dream, it’s not a dream, the regret from that day,  
I won’t forget, I won’t forget, the scars on my palms.  
It’s not in vain, it’s not in vain, I want to celebrate it all,  
Just a little more to go.

You might also like, getting sweaty from the heat of wishes,  
Standing under the weight of expectations, feeling timid,  
Our jersey number isn’t on our backs, but the answer deep in our eyes,  
Overlapping, shining together, FOREVER.

From tension, anxiety begins to sprout,  
Like roots taking hold, it tries to control us.  
But I won’t let such things defeat me,  
Now, I’ll burn this fate and let loose.

Reach out!  
It doesn’t have to be a miracle, it doesn’t have to be beautiful,  
Because that thing called purpose shines bright.  
An unbreakable battery, as long as my soul endures,  
I’ll just burn this fate and let loose.

I’ll just hold up this fate and face it head-on.
