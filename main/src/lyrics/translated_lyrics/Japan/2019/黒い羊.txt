**Translated Lyrics:**

I want to clarify the vague things  
It's a hassle to pass through the bustling shopping street at dusk,  
So I take a detour, crossing the railroad tracks on my way home.  

I'm not good with the classroom after school,  
It feels like we understand each other just by being there,  
But there's no real discussion,  
And I, feeling out of place, become silent.  
"Let's say what we want and solve it,"  
Isn't that a bit too optimistic?  

Someone let out a sigh,  
Yes, that's probably the true voice.  

Black sheep, yes, if only I could disappear,  
Then the stopped clock would start ticking again, right?  
Is there really an answer that everyone can agree on?  
If I'm the only one against it, then they might as well ignore me.  
Being persuaded by everyone makes me feel even more uncomfortable,  
To my friends exchanging glances, I'm just a nuisance.  

Standing out in a pure white flock,  
I’m the only black sheep.  
Even if I say that, I don’t want to be dyed the same color.  
When is the right moment to turn on the light in a dim room?  
My phone only holds a past devoid of love,  
I can't figure out the answers to human relationships,  
And I regret not having been there.  

Most of life doesn’t go as I wish,  
There are so many things I can't accept, and I was told to give up,  
But if that's the case, I won't accept it after all,  
Every time, I spit in defiance,  
Is it wrong to bite back?  

No, no, no, no,  
It's all my fault.  

Black sheep, yes, if only I could disappear,  
Then the stopped clock would start ticking again, right?  
Is there really an answer that everyone can agree on?  
If I'm the only one against it, then they might as well ignore me.  
Being persuaded by everyone makes me feel even more uncomfortable,  
To my friends exchanging glances, I'm just a nuisance.  
I know that.  

La la la...  

I absolutely do not want to be a white sheep,  
The moment I become that, I will no longer be myself.  
Have I caused anyone trouble by being different from those around me?  
What do the adults who tell me to dye my hair dislike?  
Do they think it will become a symbol of rebellion?  
Am I a nuisance just for being a different color?  
Oh,  
Those who abandon their own truth and pretend to be white sheep,  
Will you find the black sheep and laugh while pointing?  
If that's the case, I will always,  
Even so, I will always stand out here.
