**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
This bubble, bittersweet in its essence,  
Holds the feelings that burst within.  
My body won’t obey my commands,  
“Don’t go,” it pleads,  
If only I could just run away.

[Verse 2]  
This place feels both vast and confined,  
Words I want to say get stuck in my throat.  
My body laments its desire to return,  
“Don’t go,” it cries,  
If only someone would shout that for me.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I can’t escape,  
I can’t break free,  
This isn’t a story that can just end.  
I have no intention of cooling down easily,  
So for now, just give me that.

[Chorus]  
Unfading feelings  
Lightly ignite and take flight,  
I’m hoping for something that starts from my fingertips,  
I’m swimming, I’m drowning,  
Tonight, just like this,  
If only I could sleep within this bubble.

[Verse 3]  
Gradually, I can hardly breathe,  
The walls of my heart are full of holes,  
Out of control, am I quite unhappy?  
In despair, I am.

[Verse 4]  
I don’t need much,  
Just a single bar of happiness will do,  
I want to be fulfilled, I want to fulfill,  
I want to be disturbed, I want to meet  
Someone from long ago.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I feel helpless,  
I can’t finish this,  
This isn’t a story that can just end.  
I have no intention of giving up easily,  
So for now, just give me that.

[Chorus]  
Unspoken feelings  
I swallow lightly and hide away,  
Caught off guard by the true feelings clinging to my nose,  
I’m embraced, I’m deceived,  
In tonight’s night breeze,  
Swaying as I’m blown away.

[Verse 5]  
Hey, let’s go home, let’s go home,  
Even the shadows are fading now,  
In the end, it’s a tasteless, flavorless  
Night that falls asleep.

[Verse 6]  
Unhealed feelings  
Only accelerate more and more,  
I can’t stop,  
As night falls, I’m released,  
I remain just like this.

[Chorus]  
Unfading feelings  
Lightly ignite and take flight,  
I’m hoping for something that starts from my fingertips,  
I’m swimming, I’m drowning,  
Tonight, just like this,  
If only I could sleep within this bubble.

[Outro]  
In someone’s arms,  
While dreaming sweet dreams,  
If only I could sleep like that.
