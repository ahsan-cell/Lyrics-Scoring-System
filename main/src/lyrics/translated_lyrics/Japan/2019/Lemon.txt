**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
How wonderful it would have been if it were just a dream  
I still see you in my dreams  
Like going back to retrieve something forgotten  
I brush off the dust of old memories  

[Verse 2]  
You were the one who taught me  
That there are happinesses that won’t return  
The dark past I couldn’t speak of, hidden away  
Without you, it remains eternally dark  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know for sure that there’s no more  
Pain that I could endure beyond this  

[Chorus]  
Even the sadness of that day, even the suffering of that day  
I loved it all, together with you  
The bitter scent of lemons lingers in my heart,  
I can’t go home until the rain stops  
Even now, you are my light  

[Verse 3]  
In the darkness, I traced your silhouette  
I remember that outline vividly  
Every time I encounter something I can’t bear  
Only tears overflow endlessly  

[Pre-Chorus]  
What were you doing? What were you seeing?  
With a profile I don’t know  

[Chorus]  
If somewhere you’re now  
In tears, feeling the same loneliness as I do,  
Please forget about me  
I wish for that from the bottom of my heart  
Even now, you are my light  

[Bridge]  
More than I thought,  
I was in love with you  
Since then, I can’t breathe as I wish  
Even though you were so close  
It feels like a lie  
I can’t forget you at all  
That much is certain  

[Chorus]  
Even the sadness of that day, even the suffering of that day  
I loved it all, together with you  
The bitter scent of lemons lingers in my heart,  
I can’t go home until the rain stops  
Like one half of a divided fruit,  
Even now, you are my light
