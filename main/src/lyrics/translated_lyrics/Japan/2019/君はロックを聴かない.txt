**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
You seem a little lonely,  
So I’ll play you this song.  
A signal with a clap,  
A casual surprise,  
My own heartfelt effort.

[Verse 2]  
On the donut-shaped stage covered in dust,  
The dreams of that day dance.  
Seriously, I drop the needle,  
Holding my breath too long,  
Now let’s lower our hips.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The sound of youth starts to flow,  
Let’s dance to this dry melody.

[Chorus]  
Though you think you don’t listen to rock,  
I want you to come a little closer to me.  
Even if you think you don’t listen to rock,  
With this kind of song, with that kind of song,  
I’ve crossed over into love.

[Verse 3]  
The BPM of my heart  
Has hit one hundred and ninety-two.  
Do you notice it?  
Why are you laughing now?  
Your eyes swim like it’s a lie.

[Pre-Chorus]  
The sound of youth drifts lazily,  
This dry melody won’t stop.

[Chorus]  
Though you think you don’t listen to rock,  
I want you to come a little closer to me.  
Even if you think you don’t listen to rock,  
With this kind of song, with that kind of song,  
I’ve been yearning for love.

[Bridge]  
I know you don’t listen to rock,  
But I want you to lean in like a lover.  
Even if you think you don’t listen to rock,  
With this kind of song, with that kind of song,  
My heart aches again.

[Chorus]  
Though you think you don’t listen to rock,  
I want you to come a little closer to me.  
Even if you think you don’t listen to rock,  
With this kind of song, with that kind of song,  
I’ve crossed over into love.

[Post-Chorus]  
I’ve crossed over into love.
