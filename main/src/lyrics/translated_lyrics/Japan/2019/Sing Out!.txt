**Translated Lyrics:**

Happy! Happy! If you wanna bring big smiles, sing out!

The world is too vast  
To see it all at once.  
How far does the blue sky stretch?  
Beyond the horizon,  
Is it clear and bright?  
Or is it pouring rain?

For someone who isn’t here,  
What can I do right now?  
It would be nice if everyone could feel  
Their own happiness,  
And if we share it little by little,  
Smiles will spread.

Let this feeling reach you, clap your hands,  
Ride the wind and let love's song fly.  
You’re not alone,  
Say hello! Say hello! Say hello!

LA LA LA LA LA LA…  
Happy! Happy! Everybody be happy!  
LA LA LA LA LA LA…  
Happy! Happy! If you wanna bring big smiles, sing out!

Even if there’s someone crying  
Somewhere out there,  
It doesn’t make sense to ask why.  
Living is complicated,  
And it’s not so easy  
To truly understand each other.

Just quietly let the wind blow,  
Like looking up at the same sky.  
It’s enough to just be there together.  
That exposed heart  
Longs for warmth;  
Loneliness is tough.

We are here, stomp your feet,  
Make some noise to be noticed!  
Can you hear the voices of friends?  
Bring peace! Bring peace! Bring peace!

One day, someone who isn’t here  
Will sing out loud too.  
For someone unknown…  
Everyone is weak,  
Let’s support each other  
And move forward together.

Let this feeling reach you, clap your hands,  
Ride the wind and let love's song fly.  
You’re not alone,  
Say hello! Say hello! Say hello!

We are here, stomp your feet,  
Make some noise to be noticed!  
Can you hear the voices of friends?  
Bring peace! Bring peace! Bring peace!

LA LA LA LA LA LA…  
Happy! Happy! Everybody be happy!  
LA LA LA LA LA LA…  
Happy! Happy! If you wanna bring big smiles, sing out!  
LA LA LA LA LA LA…  
Happy! Happy! Everybody be happy!  
LA LA LA LA LA LA…  
Happy! Happy! If you wanna bring big smiles, sing out!
