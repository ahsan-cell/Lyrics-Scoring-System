**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: DAOKO]  
The shore I gazed upon that day  
I still remember it now  
Words etched upon the sand  
Your silhouette behind me  

[Pre-Chorus: DAOKO]  
The waves returning  
Brush past my feet, sweeping something away  
In the evening calm  
Only the sunset drifts by  

[Chorus: DAOKO & Kenshi Yonezu]  
Watching fireworks burst brightly  
Surely, summer isn’t over yet  
Untangling my vague heart, we held on tight  
I wished this night would last forever  

[Verse 2: Kenshi Yonezu]  
“How many more times can I watch fireworks with you?”  
What can I do for that smiling face?  
The cycle of joy and pain, like waves and emotions  
Impatience, the sound of the last train  
I’ll call out your name in words, again and again  
Choosing through the waves, once more  
So that I won’t have to feel sadness again  

[Chorus: DAOKO & Kenshi Yonezu]  
Gasping, the light seems like it might fade away  
Surely, it still lives in my heart  
If I reach out, I can touch a warm future  
Secretly watching us both  

[Bridge: DAOKO, Kenshi Yonezu, DAOKO & Kenshi Yonezu]  
Fireworks burst (fireworks burst)  
Blooming in the night (blooming in the night)  
Blooming in the night (blooming in the night)  
Quietly fading away (quietly fading away)  
Don’t let go (don’t let go)  
Just a little longer (just a little longer)  
Just a little longer, let’s stay like this  

[Verse 3: DAOKO]  
The shore I gazed upon that day  
I still remember it now  
Words etched upon the sand  
Your silhouette behind me  

[Chorus: DAOKO & Kenshi Yonezu]  
Watching fireworks burst brightly  
Surely, summer isn’t over yet  
Untangling my vague heart, we held on tight  
I wished this night would last forever  

[Outro: DAOKO & Kenshi Yonezu]  
La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la  
La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la-la  
La, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la-la  
La-la-la, la-la-la
