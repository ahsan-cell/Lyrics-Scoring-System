**[Intro]**  
Ooh, uh-uh  

**[Verse 1]**  
In the twilight, plucking strings, exposed to sorrow, under cloudy blooms (Grra)  
In this withered town, there's no solace (Ha-ha)  
With a forlorn nose dripping, I laugh foolishly (Uh-huh)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I can't laugh at this petty mud fight  
With a crimson hair ornament, a rival in love (Grra)  
I want to touch the velvet corners of your eyes (Ha-ha)  
With a chilly smile (Uh-huh)  

**[Chorus]**  
You are a flamingo, a vibrant flamingo  
Even if you dance and laugh carelessly, nothing changes  
Only loneliness and jealousy remain  
Thanks for the memories, next time cherish it more  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Ooh, uh-uh (Ahem)  
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah (Yes)  
See Kenshi Yonezu Live  
Get tickets as low as $198  

**[Verse 2]**  
Grateful for your gaze  
Soaring aimlessly, slipping away (Brra)  
Mocking bravado, humming along (Cha-cha-cha)  
In confusion, foolishness is laid bare (Uh-huh)  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I just want to hear that beloved voice  
Gathering around the half-hearted earnings of those daydreams (Grra)  
Shining on this trivial stage  
Even if it's just you (Uh-huh)  

**[Chorus]**  
That’s a flamingo, oh how terrifying, a flamingo  
Blushing, floating aimlessly, saying goodbye  
That’s not right, let’s talk more properly  
Damn it, I won’t swallow the spit I spat out  

**[Bridge]**  
(Heh-ye) Beaten by the light rain, with a dripping nose  
I hold a cat toy in my right hand  
(Heh-ye) You can’t fool me with this level anymore  
Wandering in the abyss of eternity  
(Heh-ye) To the hellish judge, I must say  
Please take care of that girl  
(Heh-ye) A drunken tale of paper-mâché  
Let’s keep playing this farce until we die  

**[Chorus]**  
You are a flamingo, a vibrant flamingo  
Even if you dance and laugh carelessly, nothing changes  
Only jealousy remains (La-la-la, la-la-la-la)  
Thanks for the memories, next time cherish it more  

**[Outro]**  
In the twilight, plucking strings, under cloudy blooms  
In this withered town, there's no solace  
Laughing foolishly (Mmm)
