**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
The strength of the wind shakes my heart a little too much,  
I miss you, looking at me so seriously.  

[Verse 2]  
Pretending to be pitiful in these tumbling days,  
I tried to slack off, but the light of hope is still shining.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Right in front of me, it keeps on shining,  
I am happy.  

[Chorus]  
You in the straw hat,  
Resemble the swaying marigolds.  
That was back in summer when the sky was still blue,  
A love from those days that made me smile with nostalgia.  
"Please don’t leave me,"  
As you gaze at me with tearful eyes,  
I gently hold you tight with a cloud-like tenderness,  
Embracing you, embracing you, never letting go.  

[Verse 3]  
I’m not strong enough to spill all my true feelings,  
But strangely enough,  
I can’t see despair.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The silhouette reflected deep in my eyes,  
I love you so much.  

[Chorus]  
With our soft skin pressed together,  
We walk through the slightly cold air today,  
Talking about what name we should give this day.  
Ah, the words "I love you" aren’t enough, so I kiss you,  
Because the clouds still cast our shadows,  
Forever and ever, just like this.  

[Bridge]  
Even if we’re far away,  
I want to stay connected.  
May our feelings for each other  
Always be the same.  

[Chorus]  
You in the straw hat,  
Resemble the swaying marigolds.  
That was back in summer when the sky was still blue,  
A love from those days that made me smile with nostalgia.  
"Please don’t leave me,"  
As you gaze at me with tearful eyes,  
I gently hold you tight with a cloud-like tenderness,  
Embracing you, never letting go.  
Ah, the words "I love you" aren’t enough, so I kiss you,  
Because the clouds still cast our shadows,  
Forever and ever, just like this.  

[Outro]  
Never letting go,  
Forever and ever, never letting go.
