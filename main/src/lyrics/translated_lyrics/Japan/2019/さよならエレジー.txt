**Translated Lyrics:**

Right now, in the silent sky,  
I breathe out a cloud named loneliness.  
That cloud brings the rain,  
A rainbow appears, though I know I can't grasp it.

I want to repeat my first kiss.

Love bites me and says it won't let go,  
But it seems the shape of loneliness never changes.  
Soar away, beyond the night someday,  
Shine so bright, your song, until I'm fed up.

The kindness in these murky days  
Feels like a crowded train.

I carelessly tossed aside the warmth that had grown cold.

Even if I believe in love, it will surely disappear, right?  
If that's the case, I don't need it; it's too sad.  
I might not even be able to say goodbye properly,  
So instead of waving, I tried to hold you tight.  
I saw a shooting star, I saw a shooting star,  
My wish is in this song.

Just being by your side made me truly happy,  
Just being by your side, that was all I needed.

Love bites me and says it won't let go,  
But it seems the shape of loneliness never changes.  
Soar away, beyond the night someday,  
Shine so bright, your song, until I'm fed up.

No more pain, no more hurting,  
Shine bright, your song.
