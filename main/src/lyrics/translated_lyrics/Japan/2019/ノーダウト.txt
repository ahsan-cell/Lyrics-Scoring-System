**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Ooh

[Refrain]  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]  
Like magic,  
Rumors spread so easily,  
In the face of prejudice,  
Neither purity nor justice really matter.

[Pre-Chorus]  
It can't be helped, there's nothing to be done,  
So say the selfish adults, doing as they please.  
Feel free,  
I don’t mind if you hate me.

[Chorus]  
Let me show you a big lie,  
One that even God would fall for, woah.  
No one knows  
That it’s all just a facade, perfect and flawless.

[Post-Chorus]  
Lie and lie, lie and lie,  
And with just a little love,  
Let me show you the greed,  
Beyond that, hey, hey, yo.

[Refrain]  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]  
Stop, you false warriors,  
Spreading chaos and running wild.  
Using it beautifully,  
I’m drenched in a shower of skyscrapers.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Suspicious, strange,  
I can’t feel anything else.  
I have no obligation  
To be blamed by the voice of the times.

[Chorus]  
Let me show you a big lie,  
One that even God would fall for, woah.  
Let me show you that beautiful  
Fragment of wildness deep within.

[Bridge]  
Yeah, woah  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3]  
Wake up quickly to the nonsense (wake up),  
Realize you’ve been deceived (realize).  
No matter how many times you’re betrayed,  
Open your eyes and laugh, one more time.

[Chorus]  
Let me show you a big lie,  
One that even God would fall for, woah.  
No one knows  
That it’s all just a facade, perfect and flawless.

[Post-Chorus]  
Lie and lie, lie and lie,  
And with just a little love,  
Let me show you the greed,  
Beyond that, hey, hey, yo.

[Refrain]  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
One more time  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah  
Yeah-eah-eah-eah (Oh-oh-oh)  
Woah-oh-oh
