**Translated Lyrics:**

It felt like I was born  
On the side of mistakes in this search for errors,  
But on the side of finding the right answers,  
I think I surely wouldn’t have met you.

Why is it that we can laugh together so fittingly,  
Yet tears come to my eyes?

Your gaze pierced straight through my heart,  
And since that day, everything felt transformed.  
In a deep corner of spring, ready to be swept away by the wind,  
I find myself casually by your side, almost bored.

In the trivial gaps filled with countless mistakes,  
We shared silly stories until we were exhausted.  
What has this loneliness of wanting to be right, yet not being,  
Nurtured within us?

Let’s discover each one,  
Like children waking up from sleep.

Your hand touched mine, our fingers intertwined,  
Whether it’s a mistake or the right choice didn’t matter at all.  
In the blink of an eye, we fell into a soft haze,  
And I just feel strongly that it has to be you.

Your gaze pierced straight through my heart,  
And since that day, everything felt transformed.  
In a deep corner of spring, ready to be swept away by the wind,  
Show me the face you don’t show anyone else.

Your hand touched mine, our fingers intertwined,  
Whether it’s a mistake or the right choice didn’t matter at all.  
In the blink of an eye, we fell into a soft haze,  
And I just feel strongly that it has to be you.
