**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
It's a refreshing morning,  
At times like this, I want to hear your "I love you" (Ah, ah)  
The swaying curtains,  
Even my slightly messy bangs,  
Everything feels just right (Ah)  

[Verse 2]  
Then there's the broken sunny-side-up egg,  
It’s not quite right,  
Even if I try to balance it, it overflows (Ah, ah)  
A little salty,  
A little bland,  
Maybe it's just too much,  
For now, today is fine.  

[Chorus]  
With a wish in a rose,  
Let’s dance in a foolish dream (Ah)  
I want to convey my love,  
Even if I’m stuck thinking about silly things,  
Little by little, I sink into the sofa,  
It’s not like I’ll become a good man by tomorrow,  
So I’ll take it easy,  
Will we meet when the sun sets today?  

[Verse 3]  
You laughed and said,  
"You can’t shine as a perfect man," which stings (Ah, ah)  
There are so many things I want to talk about,  
It’s lonely (Ah)  

[Verse 4]  
In the end, what do you want,  
Really, do you want to love me? (Oh, oh)  
Raindrops are falling,  
The flower I like by the window,  
For now, today is fine.  

[Chorus]  
Turning off the lights in the room,  
Let’s dream of anything (Ah)  
Even if I think about wanting to spend tomorrow together,  
The door won’t open,  
Little by little, I’m just becoming a mess,  
It’s not that I’m saying love is everything,  
But if I had to say, it’s just painfully endless,  
I can’t take it anymore.  

[Bridge]  
With the candlelight,  
Even if there’s a ridiculously big cake,  
It’s not like you’ll come to eat it,  
Today, I keep thinking about all these pathetic, unfair things.  

[Chorus]  
There aren’t even any roses,  
In a dirty shirt, I’m wearing a worn-out bread,  
I want to convey my love,  
Even if I’m stuck thinking about silly things,  
Little by little, I sink into the sofa,  
It’s not like I’ll become a good man by tomorrow,  
So I’ll take it easy,  
Will we meet when the sun sets today?
