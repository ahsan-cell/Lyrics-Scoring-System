**Translated Lyrics:**

Sometimes, without realizing it,  
I find myself imitating the stand.  
Time stops, or is it stopped?  
I come to know the fear of the thread.

[Verse]  
It’s all pointless, that’s what they say,  
Avduru, Iggy, Kakyoin, Joseph.  
Polnareff will show up later,  
But for now, let’s take down what’s left.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What can DIO do right now?  
Even if time is stopped,  
If Star Platinum can still move,  
It’s just a lot of pointless chatter, isn’t it?  
If it’s Jotaro, he might just make it,  
Can he really stop time with his stand?  
By then, surely,  
This DIO will be dead.

[Chorus]  
Do you remember how many loaves of bread you’ve eaten until now?  
Before you say something like that,  
Jotaro is stopping time.  
The World and Star Platinum,  
Ora ora and pointless chatter,  
I threw out the Road Roller to finish it off.  
Foolishness,  
Stand power!

[Outro]  
Wha...what’s happening to my body!?  
DIO!
