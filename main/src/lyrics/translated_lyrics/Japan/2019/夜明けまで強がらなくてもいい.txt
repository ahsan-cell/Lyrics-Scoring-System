**Translated Lyrics:**

Regret drips from the faucet

Looking back on the day that’s gone,
I become so anxious I can’t sleep.

No matter who I consult, they say I’m overthinking,
How can I learn to accept myself?

Where is the light? Please shine on me,
The darkness, the darkness is where tears are shed.
Where is hope? The moment of rebirth,
Until dawn, I don’t have to pretend to be strong anymore.

Things that used to come easily,
Now I lack confidence and don’t want to leave my room.

I feel frustrated with this pathetic self,
Wasting life—who do I apologize to?

Where is the light? Please guide me,
The sun, the sun pushes dreams forward.
Where is tomorrow? Stand up unsteadily,
Until dawn, it’s okay to look foolish.

I see the morning sun rising; I won’t complain anymore,
Today, today I will live as my true self.

Where is the light? Please shine on me,
Anxiety, anxiety is just the flip side of expectation.
Where is hope? The moment of rebirth,
Oh sun, oh sun, will you take me out?
Dawn will come soon.
