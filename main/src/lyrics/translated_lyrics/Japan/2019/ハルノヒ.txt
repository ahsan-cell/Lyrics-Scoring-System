**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
On the platform of Kitasenju station,  
A silver ticket booth,  
Sharing memories and diving deep into thoughts,  
On a bench that’s worn,  
We can’t see anything,  
Swearing to each other about the future.

[Verse 2]  
The trees braving the cold and a cat,  
As if they’re talking about us,  
Shaking gently as if to bloom,  
Smiling beautifully,  
No need to rush,  
One day, let it become a bouquet for us.

[Pre-Chorus]  
So please wait until then,  
We’ll explore what’s next together,  
Let’s spend time until we get bored,  
While conveying our limited love.

[Chorus]  
What kind of future  
Is peeking in from over here?  
If we share your strength and my weakness,  
What amazing things might happen?  
Look,  
I’m so happy like this,  
Sometimes alone, sometimes together,  
Let’s keep cherishing what’s important.

[Verse 2]  
Walking lightly through Kitasenju station,  
In a sky-blue skirt,  
Always far away,  
The sound of footsteps quickening,  
I felt like I couldn’t be honest.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Indulging too much in kindness,  
With the back of a man who’s too wrapped up,  
It’s only you who can hold my palm,  
So you must walk ahead.

[Chorus]  
I wish the future  
Would wave its hand over here,  
Searching for a place to return  
That doesn’t feel awkward with the daily struggles.  
Look,  
It’s already such a beautiful sunset,  
When I recall the light from that day,  
I’ll surely notice what’s precious.

[Bridge]  
No need to rush,  
One day, let it become a bouquet for us,  
We can’t see anything,  
Swearing to each other about the future.

[Chorus]  
What kind of future  
Is peeking in from over here?  
If we share your strength and my weakness,  
What amazing things might happen?  
Look, I’m so happy like this,  
Sometimes alone, sometimes together,  
No, even more,  
Shall we keep cherishing what’s important?

[Outro]  
On the familiar platform of the station,  
A watery greeting,  
“Welcome back,”  
Stepping on the small swaying shadows, feeling happiness.
