**Translated Lyrics:**

I loved this place  
As I close the manga I can't stop in the middle, I lift my face and realize  
That the cozy sunlight has turned into shadows, fading into twilight  
When I met you, I talked so passionately that I forgot the passing time  
My dream is not here, but somewhere else  

The way back, the way back, makes me want to take a detour  
Where should I go, where will I end up?  
On the path of the past, there's no chance of getting lost  
Coward, to a new world  
Now, I want to go, I want to go, I want to go, I want to be strong  
Oh, I loved this place  
Oh, let’s take the first step  

The city lights feel lonely, suddenly because they’re different from the familiar scenery  
The usual elevated train line has disappeared from view  
I don’t know where I am  

People aren’t used to changing, wanting to stay here today just like yesterday and tomorrow  

On unknown paths, on unknown paths, how many more times can I walk?  
Towards dreams, towards love, the wind doesn’t choose the road  

I’ll keep going, even if it’s a signpost of fate, I’ll keep going, I’ll keep going, I’ll keep going, even if I can’t go back  
It’s sad to part from you, but it’s an important farewell  
I need to know a much wider world  
Someday, surely we’ll understand the meaning of choosing a different path, for a shining future  

Like the wind, like the wind, let’s try living as we think  
No matter how dazzling the past was, the future might be even brighter  

The way back, the way back, makes me want to take a detour  
Where should I go, where will I end up?  
On the path of the past, there's no chance of getting lost  
Coward, to a new world  
Now, I want to go, I want to go, I want to go, I want to be strong  
Oh, I loved this place  
Oh, precious memories  
Oh, I loved this place
