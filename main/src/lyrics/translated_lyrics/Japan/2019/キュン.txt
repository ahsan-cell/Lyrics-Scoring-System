**Translated Lyrics:**

Thump, thump, thump, why do I feel this way?  
I just fall in love with you.  
Thump, thump, thump, it’s bittersweet,  
Thump, thump, thump, it’s bittersweet,  
You know, I can't stop loving you.

Sunday, don’t ask me why,  
Monday, please don’t question it.  
Tuesday, surely, you wouldn’t understand,  
Wednesday, I see you every day,  
Thursday, I’ve been thinking of you,  
Friday, it’s been on my mind since Saturday.

It’s strange how much I want to see you more,  
I’m sure I can’t find the courage to speak.  
When our eyes meet, my heart tightens.

Using the train window as a mirror,  
I quietly check my spring uniform.  
With a jet-black hair tie wrapped around my arm,  
I gather my hair into a ponytail.

“Cute.”

Your little gestures make me swoon,  
In an instant, I became captivated.  
Like static electricity, just for a moment,  
I felt a jolt.  
As if nothing happened, I’ll watch from afar,  
Unaware of such feelings,  
It only makes me want to hold you tighter.

Thump, thump, thump, I’m falling for you,  
Thump, thump, thump, I’m falling for you.  
I just fall in love with you.  
Thump, thump, thump, so dear,  
Thump, thump, thump, so dear,  
You know, I can't stop loving you.

Yes, since that day, I’ve been thinking of you,  
My mind is filled with thoughts of you.  
Even when night falls, I can’t seem to sleep.

When a cabbage white butterfly  
Landed on my shoulder in the train,  
You gently caught it with both hands  
And let it go through the open window.

“I like you.”

I’ll do anything I can for you,  
For your sake, I’d do anything.  
I want to protect my pure heart,  
So it won’t get stained.  
I’ll try to manage what I can’t do,  
If you just told me, I could help…  
It’s a wish that can’t come true, just a monologue.  
Liking someone is like reflexes,  
Is that really what makes me thump?  
You’d probably laugh at me.  
At an unexpected moment,  
Yes, I felt a flutter,  
This feeling,  
Takes my breath away.

Surely, even if I said it, you wouldn’t get it,  
I just thumped on my own.  
Is this how people fall in love?  
The moment it begins.

Your little gestures make me swoon,  
In an instant, I became captivated.  
Like static electricity, just for a moment,  
I felt a jolt.  
As if nothing happened, I’ll watch from afar,  
Unaware of such feelings,  
It only makes me want to hold you tighter.

Thump, thump, thump, why do I feel this way?  
Thump, thump, thump, why do I feel this way?  
I just fall in love with you.  
Thump, thump, thump, it’s bittersweet,  
Thump, thump, thump, it’s bittersweet,  
You know, I can't stop loving you.
