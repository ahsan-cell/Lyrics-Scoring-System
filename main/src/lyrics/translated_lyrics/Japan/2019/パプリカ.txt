**Translated Lyrics:**

Perhaps I’ll wander down the path,  
Circling through the Aoba forest,  
Playing around in the sunlit town,  
Someone is calling out to me.  

As summer comes, shadows rise, I want to see you,  
What I found was the evening star,  
Will tomorrow be clear too?  

When the paprika flowers bloom,  
Let’s sow seeds in the bright sky,  
If I can paint a dream of sunshine,  
Let my heart play and reach you.  

In the rain, the moon is dimmed,  
Who was crying in the shade?  
To comfort each and every one,  
Someone is calling out to me.  
If I count the joys, they’re all you,  
The light that illuminated my way home  
Was the shadow of memories.  

When the paprika flowers bloom,  
Let’s sow seeds in the bright sky,  
If I can paint a dream of sunshine,  
Let my heart play and reach you.  

I’m heading towards love, breaking through the branches,  
Singing a song,  
Holding a handful of flowers,  
La ru ra ri ra.  

I’m heading towards love, breaking through the branches,  
Singing a song,  
Holding a handful of flowers,  
La ru ra ri ra.  

When the paprika flowers bloom,  
Let’s sow seeds in the bright sky,  
If I can paint a dream of sunshine,  
Let my heart play and reach you.  

Let your toes dance, stop this finger.
