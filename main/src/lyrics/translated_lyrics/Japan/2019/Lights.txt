**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1: Jung Kook, V]  
On a Sunday when I can't reply to calls or messages,  
I can't focus on anything at all.  
Sometimes it gets overwhelming,  
And the present feels a little scary.

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]  
But I feel like I can save someone,  
I can hear your voice.  
In the midst of the noise, time stands still,  
Connected to you through sound, woah.

[Chorus: Jung Kook, V]  
If I close my eyes,  
In the darkness, your light, woah,  
Shines down on me,  
So I can walk without fear, you & I, woah.

[Post-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]  
You're my light, you're my light,  
Always,  
Shining into my heart.  
You're my light, you're my light,  
No matter how far apart,  
You still reach me.

[Verse 2: j-hope]  
Angels who know pain,  
Flying through the night with battered wings.  
Every time I'm thinking about love,  
Every time I'm thinking about love.  
I don't want to hear just bright songs,  
I want to face loneliness and color the now.  
Losing something, gaining something, still seeking something today.

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook, V]  
Yes, I believe in change,  
No one is perfect.  
Even this moment has its meaning,  
And we connect through sound, woah.

[Chorus: Jin, Jimin]  
If I close my eyes,  
In the darkness, my light, woah,  
I’ll shine for you,  
So let’s walk without fear, you & I, woah.

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, V]  
I'm your light, I'm your light,  
Always,  
Shining into your heart.  
I'm your light, I'm your light,  
No matter how far apart,  
I’ll reach you.

[Verse 3: SUGA, RM]  
I thought sleepless nights were impossible,  
But it seems that's not the case.  
And once again, I get stronger.  
What is love?  
If the answer is there,  
I want to know right away.  
I'm breaking down, yet I see a light.  
No matter how painful the night, morning will come.  
I’ll overcome, even the future,  
I won’t stop anymore.  
The value of happiness is something I should decide for myself,  
And once again, I’ll grow up today.

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jung Kook]  
But there are times I show my weakness,  
It’s okay to be just as I am.  
Don’t lie to yourself anymore,  
Everything connects through sound, woah.

[Chorus: Jin, V]  
If I close my eyes,  
In the darkness, your light, woah,  
Shines down on me,  
So I can walk without fear, you & I, woah.

[Post-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin]  
You're my light, you're my light,  
Always,  
Shining into my heart.  
You're my light, you're my light,  
No matter how far apart,  
You still reach me.

[Outro: Jimin, V]  
Even if we’re apart, you still reach me.  
Even if we’re apart, you still reach me.
