**Translated Lyrics:**

Caught in the magic of snow,  
I fell in love with you.  
Could it be that you are a snow fairy?  

On the snowy mountain where stars fall,  
Until I saw you, I didn’t truly believe in anything at all.  
The mountain you live in is “Snowland.”  
You told me I was born in this land where snow falls all year round.  

Hey, I’ve never seen summer,  
That burning summer, seeing it is my dream.  
But in this world of good, there must be many romantic things unknown to those who don’t know?  

**Snow Magic Fantasy**  
Caught in the magic of snow,  
I fell in love with you.  
Could it be that you are a snow spirit?  

I’ve lived my life until now without anyone loving me, all alone.  
Until the moment I met you,  
Suddenly,  
I asked, “Since you’re a fairy, are you really two hundred years old?”  
And that felt somewhat ignored.  

Hey, life eventually comes to an end,  
You and I will face that end.  
But why did we meet?  
You brought both “happiness” and “sorrow” along with you,  
Such a cruel thing.  

**Snow Magic Fantasy**  
Caught in the magic of snow,  
I fell in love with you.  
Could it be that you are a snow spirit?  
A fantasy with a snow fairy.  

Soon, I began to feel sleepy,  
Being with you must have been like this all along.  
But it’s okay, for the first time, I could love someone.  
This is my happy ending.  

**Snow Magic Fantasy**  
Caught in the magic of snow,  
I fell in love with you.  
Could it be that you are a snow spirit?  
A fantasy with a snow fairy.
