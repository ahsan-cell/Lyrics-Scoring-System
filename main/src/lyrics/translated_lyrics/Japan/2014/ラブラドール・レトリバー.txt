**Translated Lyrics:**

A pure white parasol  
Is your reserved spot for the summer  
Beachside  
That 70's bikini  
Is this year's favorite, right?  

Did you come on vacation  
Before your mom and dad? (Oh yeah!)  
Last year was a time over  
The continuation of love (of love)  
The sun is waiting for us  

Labrador, run  
To the shoreline  
Splashing water,  
Inviting us to play  
Chasing on the sand  
Just like that day  
Kicking off our sandals  
(Laughing)  
Shall we share  
Our first kiss?  

Oh Ma Cherie  
Just one bottle of mineral water  
Passing it back and forth  
Pure heart  
My heart races  
Because I truly love you  
You might also like  
When the seasons pass  
No one will be around (Oh yeah!)  
But until I can say I love you  
My (my) summer (summer)  
Is far from over  

Labrador, come here  
Finally warmed up  
I’ll hold you tight  
In these arms  
Memories always  
Leave some regrets  
This time, I won’t let go  
(Yes, with you)  
Shall we share  
The kiss we’ve been longing for?  

Our love  
Has been patiently watched  
For many years  
Friends who grew up together  
Since we were little  
Always on our side  
Labrador  

Labrador, run  
To the shoreline  
Splashing water,  
Inviting us to play  
Chasing on the sand  
Just like that day  
Kicking off our sandals  
(Laughing)  
Shall we share  
Our first kiss?
