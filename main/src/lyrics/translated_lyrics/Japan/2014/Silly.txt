**Translated Lyrics:**

Today, the rain continues to fall just the same  
In the gaps of my breath, I hear your name called  
The loneliness of days apart is drowned out  
Rainy day, oh rainy day  
Caught in the creaking waves

Oh, it's so silly  
Living today, wanting something, needing to be sure  
Oh, it's so silly  
If I can deceive, then reality isn’t needed  
Inescapable sorrow, oh, it’s so silly

Hiding the traces of tears behind a brave face  
Pretending not to notice, our skin touches in the night  
While repeating shallow sleep  
I’m confirming your presence beside me  
Rainy day, oh rainy day  
Unable to fully become an adult

Oh, it's so silly  
Seeking salvation, wanting to feel fulfilled, living today  
Oh, it's so silly  
If I could be forgiven, I’d just want to hold this love  
Even if it’s an inescapable pain, oh, it’s so silly

Meaningless, there’s nothing in tomorrow  
Pretending not to see, pretending not to understand  
I’m running away, so silly  
If I lose that innocent trembling, it would be fine  
Twisted feelings, I want you

Oh, it's so silly  
Living today, wanting something, needing to be sure  
Oh, it's so silly  
If I can deceive, then reality isn’t needed  
Inescapable sorrow,  
Even the scars now feel dear  
Oh, it's so silly
