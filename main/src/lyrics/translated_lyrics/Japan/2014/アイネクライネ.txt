**Translated Lyrics:**

I'm truly happy to have met you,  
Yet everything feels sad as if it's just the norm.  
Now, the memories that are painfully joyful  
Walk alongside the farewell that will someday come.

If living means taking someone else's place,  
I’d rather turn into a mere stone.  
If that were the case, there'd be no misunderstandings or confusion,  
And I could remain unaware of you too.

I want all my feelings to reach you,  
But I have secrets I can't share, and I end up lying.  
Though you think of me more than I realize,  
Why am I so cowardly?

Even the lingering sadness and frays, when I'm with you,  
How wonderful it is to laugh and say, "That’s enough."  
Everything in front of me blurs and seems to melt away,  
Overflowing with miracles, yet still not enough—  
You called my name.

If you were to lose your place and wander,  
I wish someone could take your place instead.  
Now, pretending not to see the delicate and certain,  
We’ll surely keep laughing together, over and over again.

No matter how many times I swear or pray, I see dreadful dreams,  
A small distortion that might one day swallow you whole.  
Though you think of me more than I realize,  
Why am I so inadequate?

Please, may these nights that I can never overcome  
Continue as we hold hands trying to get through.  
Even to color my closed eyelids vividly,  
What can I do for that?  
Can I call your name?

The moment I was born,  
I cried out, "I want to disappear."  
Since then, I've been searching,  
For the day I can meet you.

Even the lingering sadness and frays, when I'm with you,  
How wonderful it is to laugh and say, "That’s enough."  
Everything in front of me blurs and seems to melt away,  
Overflowing with miracles, yet still not enough—  
You called my name.

Can I call your name?
