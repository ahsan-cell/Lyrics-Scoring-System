**Translated Lyrics:**

At the entrance of this party,  
When I open the door, there lies  

A giant tree reigning over, the venue called “Creepy Land.”  
You’re the star of the show here,  
Look, the bell has rung, the party begins.  

Flames and the forest's carnival,  
Even the mummy man is dancing,  
Tonight, I’ve been invited to the carnival.  

The magician told me,  
“This love must remain a secret; if not, this girl’s life is at stake.”  

“Take me to the party,”  
You say it like that,  
Shall we go see the devil DJ?  
I’ll bring back the moon’s hidden light.  

I was captivated by the robot at the bar,  
You get upset just like that,  
I kissed you without a second thought,  
Look, it’s your turn now, right?  

Flames and the forest's carnival,  
Even Cinderella is singing,  
Tonight, I’ve been invited to the carnival.  

In the crowd, I won’t let go,  
I’ve decided I won’t release your hand,  
This hand of yours, I’ll hold on tight.  

Flames and the forest's carnival,  
Even the mummy man is dancing,  
Tonight, I’ve been invited to the carnival.  

The magician told me,  
“This love must remain a secret; if not, this girl’s life is at stake.”
