**Translated Lyrics:**

Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Oh bye ya, ya, ya, ya  

[Verse 1: Miyu & Yuki & Rino]  
Look this way,  
Just for a moment,  
Notice my presence,  
Please see me.  

[Verse 2: Haruka & Jurina & Rena & Sayaka]  
Look this way,  
Just five seconds,  
I’m right here,  
See me now.  

[Pre-Chorus: Haruna & Minami & Akari & Sakura, Rina (AKB48) & Yui & Sae & Aya & Rina (Nogizaka46)]  
But really,  
Even when our eyes meet,  
I just get flustered,  
Can’t say a thing.  

[Chorus: All, Miyu & Yuki & Rino, Haruka & Jurina & Rena & Sayaka]  
A sign from my heart,  
If only you could see it,  
You’d understand my feelings…  
If I could just write, “I like you,”  
Even if my heart races,  
Even if I sweat,  
I could confess.  

[Post-Chorus: All]  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Oh bye ya, ya, ya, ya  

[Verse 3: Haruka & Jurina & Rena & Sayaka]  
Give me a chance,  
Just once,  
I’m praying alone,  
Waiting for you.  

[Verse 4: Haruna & Minami & Akari & Sakura]  
Give me a chance,  
Just by coincidence,  
Turn to me,  
Please look my way.  

[Pre-Chorus: Rina (AKB48) & Yui & Sae & Aya & Rina (Nogizaka46), Miyu & Yuki & Rino]  
Gathering my courage,  
I’ll call out to you,  
Everyone says to do it,  
But I can’t find the strength.  

[Chorus: All, Haruna & Minami & Akari & Sakura, Haruka & Jurina & Rena & Sayaka]  
A sign from my heart,  
Let me reach in with my words,  
And pull out what’s stuck in my chest.  
If I could just say, “I like you,”  
Even without a reply,  
Even if you look confused,  
I’d still feel happy.  

[Instrumental Bridge]  

[Pre-Chorus: Miyu & Yuki & Rino, Haruka & Jurina & Rena & Sayaka]  
Everyone has,  
Somewhere in their heart,  
Important words,  
That they keep hidden.  

[Chorus: All, Miyu & Yuki & Rino, Haruka & Jurina & Rena & Sayaka]  
A sign from my heart,  
If only you could see it,  
You’d understand my feelings…  
If I could just write, “I like you,”  
Even if my heart races,  
Even if I sweat,  
I could confess.  

[Chorus: All]  
A sign from my heart,  
Hey, let’s bring it out,  
What I’m thinking,  
Honestly…  
If I can’t say it out loud,  
I can just write it down,  
What I want to convey,  
What I want to talk about,  
Notice my sign.  

[Outro: All]  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Bye ya, ya, ya, ya  
Oh bye ya, ya, ya, ya
