**Translated Lyrics:**

Cheers! Cheers! Iza, we are the pioneers of this era

With a single goal in sight, we’ve come this far
On this Earth, the one and only
A vivid blue, free from any mix
A flame that burns quietly, hotter than anything else

I can hear the voice of time calling
It’s blessing us with its gentle touch
Until today, we’ve gathered our treasures
Now it’s time to put them to use

In this exhilarating mood, no one can take it away
We’re connected through the vast universe
Defeat is probably waiting over there
In a place where life becomes bare

The thoughts I had just a moment ago feel outdated
I don’t need to hold back even a little
Let my body take over, chasing time
Faster than anything, let’s carve out the present

Ah, once again, I’m drawn in by the faint scent of death
This moment is blooming ever so vividly
I’m engraving it, taking it to that world
The ultimate life, the ultimate view

The refreshing breeze is blowing, let’s embrace it, I’m back now
On this Earth, the one and only
Our flame, pure and bright
Burning more intensely than anything else
