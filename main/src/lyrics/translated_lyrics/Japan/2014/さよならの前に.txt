**Translated Lyrics:**

As if the ending lies on the last page,  
Will there come a time when our days together must end?  
With my trembling feelings hidden deep inside,  
We embraced and kissed, trying to mask the truth.

The future we swore with trembling fingertips,  
And that warmth we once felt,  
The day of parting turns it all into lies.

Goodbye to you,  
Is what we need to say,  
Did we love each other so deeply?  
Even knowing this is our conclusion,  
Could I tell you that I still love you?

Is it too late now?  
My words and hands couldn’t reach you.  
The laughter and the thorns in my heart,  
Memories seem ready to spill from my eyes.  
Maybe it’s just a bit too late,  
Because this mouth can’t be honest,  
I can’t connect my words well,  
I just want to convey, “I love you.”

Like watching the same movie over and over,  
I think of the moments we spent together until today.  
If I had understood the meaning of your lines and tears,  
Could I have traced a different scenery?

If the end is frightening, then we shouldn’t begin,  
Before we met, we believed that way,  
Without a doubt.

Goodbye to you,  
Is what we need to say,  
I want you by my side more than anyone else.  
Even knowing this is our conclusion,  
I want to feel grateful for having met you.

Goodbye to you,  
Is what we need to say,  
Did we love each other so deeply?  
Even knowing this is our conclusion,  
I want to tell you that I love you.

Goodbye to you,  
Is what we need to say,  
I want you by my side more than anyone else.  
Even knowing this is our conclusion,  
I want to feel grateful for having met you.  
I love you,  
Though it’s too late now,  
Let me say it,  
Before the goodbye.
