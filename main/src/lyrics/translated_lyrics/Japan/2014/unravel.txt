**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Tell me, tell me,  
Who is it inside me?  
I’m broken, I’m broken,  
In this world, you laugh without seeing anything.

[Verse 1]  
A broken version of me, holding my breath,  
I can’t unravel, no, I can’t unravel anymore.  
Even the truth is frozen.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Can break, can’t break, can go mad, can’t go mad,  
Finding you made me tremble.

[Chorus]  
In this distorted world, I’m gradually becoming transparent,  
Don’t find me, don’t stare at me.  
In a world drawn by someone else,  
I don’t want to hurt you.  
Remember me, keep me vivid.

[Verse 2]  
Endless loneliness entangles,  
Innocent laughter from memories pierces me.  
I can’t move, can’t move, can’t move,  
Can’t move, can’t move, can’t move.  
Unraveling the world.

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]  
Things have changed, things couldn’t be changed,  
Two intertwine, two perish.  
Can break, can’t break, can go mad, can’t go mad,  
I can’t taint you, I trembled.

[Chorus]  
In this distorted world, I’m gradually becoming transparent,  
Don’t find me, don’t stare at me.  
In a lonely trap set by someone,  
Before the future unravels,  
Remember me, keep me vivid.

[Post-Chorus]  
Don’t forget, don’t forget,  
Don’t forget, don’t forget.  
Paralyzed by what has changed,  
Full of things that can’t be changed, paradise.  
Remember me.

[Outro]  
Tell me, tell me,  
Who is it inside me?
