**Translated Lyrics:**

The road stretches on endlessly,  
As the rainbow-colored rain pours down,  
The sky begins to resonate.

Behind that dazzling smile,  
A sad sound can be heard.  
Together, we exist in this moment,  
So deeply cherished.

When we hold hands, it feels warm,  
If I turn away, Iâ€™ll be left alone.  
Each little thing becomes a part of you,  
The road continues on.

The wind carries seeds of hope,  
Light transforms into buds of dreams.

Rather than counting what I've lost,  
It's better to count what I have,  
For that makes my eyes shine bright.

When you smile, someone else smiles too,  
Overcoming brings strength anew.  
Each little thing becomes a part of you,  
The road continues on.

From now on, your story begins,  
The road stretches on endlessly,  
As the rainbow-colored rain pours down,  
The sky begins to resonate.
