**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro, Chorus]  
One, two, one two three

[Verse 1: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro]  
To the me who flatters the strong,  
A cold gaze pierces through.  
Sweat trickles down my back,  
Someone said I hate you.  
I try to praise that girl’s sweet voice,  
But I can’t stand her laugh, it drives me mad.  
Someone said I hate you.

[Pre-Chorus: Chorus]  
To live honestly is beautiful,  
But I can’t survive without painting it black.

[Chorus: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro, Chorus]  
Can you rejoice in their happiness?  
Don’t you want what she has?  
Am I really special after all?  
It's me, why don't you kill me?  
Can you love this grotesque me?  
Aren't you really wanting to cry?  
Do you have a pass to live in the now?  
It's me, why don't you kill me?  
(It's me, why don't you kill me?)

[Post-Chorus: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro, Chorus]  
One, two, one two three

[Verse 2: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro]  
Just typing the character "su"  
Predicts "I'm sorry" on the screen.  
A heartless apology from my fingertips,  
Someone said I hate you.  
The sky is so clear and blue,  
The wind flows gently,  
Yet my sighs are laid bare,  
Someone said I hate you.

[Pre-Chorus: Chorus]  
You, who live so honestly, say,  
There’s no light in the depths of your eyes.

[Chorus: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro, Chorus]  
Do you enjoy their misfortune?  
Can you speak your true feelings with that girl?  
Aren't you secretly laughing in your heart?  
It's me, why don't you kill me?  
Can you love this grotesque me?  
Aren't you really happy inside?  
Do you have a pass to live for tomorrow?  
It's me, why don't you kill me?

[Post-Chorus]  
(It's me, why don't you kill me?)  
(Yeah)  
(It's me, why don't you kill me?)  
(Why don't you kill me?)  
(It's me, why don't you kill me?)  
(It's me, why don't you kill me?)

[Bridge: Chorus]  
Expose it all, oh  
Lay it bare.

[Chorus: Ken Hirai, Namie Amuro, Chorus]  
Can you rejoice in their happiness?  
Don’t you want what she has?  
Are you really special after all?  
It's me, why don't you kill me?  
Can you love this grotesque self?  
Aren't you really wanting to cry?  
Do you have a pass to live in the now?  
It's me, why don't you kill me?  
(Why don't you kill me?)  
Why don't you kill me?
