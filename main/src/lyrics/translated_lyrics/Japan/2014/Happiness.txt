**Translated Lyrics:**

I want to tell you first,  
But I keep going in circles, oh.  

When I'm happy, when I'm frustrated,  
Even when I search, I can't find it.  
Are you feeling the same way?  

When you're sad in the dark,  
I can tell right away.  
I'm not gonna give up tonight,  
Though I'm clumsy, I'll be by your side, always.  

I'm always gonna be with you, I want to protect you.  
In this whole world, you're the most important to me.  
I love you so much, it's hard to say it right,  
Just having you here is enough for me.  
'Cause whenever, you are my happiness,  
You are my happiness.  

On a snowy night, as stars fall,  
I think of you,  
So please don’t pretend to be strong.  

The sparkles of this town,  
What kind of future are they leading to?  
Together, towards the light.  

Make a wish for you and I,  
Under the silent night.  
If your happiness can come true,  
I’ll pray for it over and over again.  

I want to protect you more than anyone else,  
Today, tomorrow, forever, it won’t change,  
It's never gonna change.  
I love you so much, it's hard to say it right,  
But with you, I can be strong.  
'Cause whenever, you are my happiness.  

I was too close to notice,  
But every day, you saved me.  
Thank you, forever the love of my life.  

I want to protect you more than anyone else,  
You're my happiness.  

I'm always gonna be with you, I want to protect you.  
In this whole world, you're the most important to me.  
I love you so much, it's hard to say it right,  
Just having you here is enough for me.  
'Cause whenever, you're my...  
You are my happiness.  

I love you, you are my happiness.
