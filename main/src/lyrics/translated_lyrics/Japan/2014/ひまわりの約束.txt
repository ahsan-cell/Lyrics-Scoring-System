**Translated Lyrics:**

Even though I'm not crying,
I feel sadder than myself,
Not knowing which pain is worse.

Today, which should have been a mess,
Becomes a treasure when we're together.

I want to be by your side,
Wondering what I can do for you,
Is there something within me?
Always, I just want you,
To keep smiling.

Like a sunflower,
Your straightforward kindness,
Embraces all warmth.

From now on, I too,
Want to reach out,
Because I've realized
The happiness that’s here.

In the distant future,
Even if we’re apart,
We’ll walk our own paths,
Believing we’ll meet again ahead.

It should have been a tangled path,
Now it overlaps as one.

Being by your side,
Even these ordinary moments,
I won’t forget.
On the day of departure,
When I wave goodbye,
I want to be able to smile.

Like a sunflower,
Your straightforward kindness,
Embraces all warmth.

Though it’s turned around,
Because it’s about you,
I think it’s already enough.

I want to be by your side,
Wondering what I can do for you,
Is there something within me?
Always, I just want you,
To keep smiling.

Like a sunflower,
Your straightforward kindness,
Embraces all warmth.
From now on, I too,
Want to reach out,
Because I’ve found
The true meaning of happiness.
