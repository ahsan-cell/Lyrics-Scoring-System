**Translated Lyrics:**

Someone left the faucet running,  
It feels like something precious is  
Continuously flowing away,  
I covered my ears against the wind.  

In a corner of my heart,  
There’s something left out in the open,  
I knew I shouldn’t let it stay this way,  
Yet I turned a blind eye to it.  

An immense amount of time,  
With endless possibilities,  
Freedom lies right there.  

How many blue skies have I seen?  
I haven’t been counting,  
The sun sets and rises again,  
An ordinary day by day,  
But I feel like I’m forgetting something.  
How many blue skies have I seen?  
Don’t miss out on your youth,  
Even if you’re living passionately,  
Sometimes look up at the sky.  
(Don’t waste your current self.)  

When I touched the water from the faucet,  
I woke up to its coldness,  
The splashing water, this life given to me,  
Felt heavy in my hands.  

Even if I think I’ll do it someday,  
In my mind,  
Eternity is short.  

How many blue skies have I seen?  
I haven’t been counting,  
The sun sets and rises again,  
An ordinary day by day,  
But I feel like I’m forgetting something.  
How many blue skies have I seen?  
Don’t miss out on your youth,  
Even if you’re living passionately,  
Sometimes look up at the sky.  
(Don’t waste your current self.)  

If you close your eyes, you might hear  
The sound you’ve left out in the open,  
We’re not just clear skies.  

I don’t know when the next blue sky will be,  
So now, I’ll look up at the sky and start something,  
Something I can do today…  
I don’t know when the next blue sky will be,  
But I’ll notice it myself,  
Even if tears overflow,  
The sun won’t blur.  
(If you look closely,)  
You can become even stronger,  
Live in the now.  
(Even as time flows,)  
I won’t be swept away.
