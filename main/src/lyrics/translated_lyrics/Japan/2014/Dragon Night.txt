**Translated Lyrics:**

As if the battle will never end, tonight we’ll raise the flames of salvation.

Each person has their own sense of “justice,” and perhaps it’s inevitable that we clash.
But I think even my despised “him” has his reasons for being.

Dragon Night, tonight, we’ll sing like friends, won’t we?
Moonlight, starlight, firebird,
Tonight, we’ll dance like friends, won’t we?

Tonight, the sun will visit the night once in a hundred thousand years,
Even the battles that seem endless will ignite the flames of proof tonight.

Each person has their own sense of “justice,” and perhaps it’s inevitable that we clash.
But surely my “justice” has been hurting him.

Dragon Night, tonight, we’ll sing like friends, won’t we?
Congratulation, graduation, celebration,
Tonight, our battle will come to an “end.”

Dragon Night, tonight, we’ll sing like friends, won’t we?
Moonlight, starlight, firebird,
Tonight, we’ll dance like friends, won’t we?

Dragon Night, tonight, we’ll sing like friends, won’t we?
Moonlight, starlight, firebird,
Tonight, we’ll dance like friends, won’t we?
