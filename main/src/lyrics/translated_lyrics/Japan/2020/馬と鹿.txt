**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In the spring, covered in mud,  
I walked without singing a tune.  
Deep within my body, it resonates,  
Feeling that I’m not enough, so strong.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Still tasting the flavor of the chewed gum,  
With a heart that can’t shake off the chill,  
One by one, I lost them all,  
Yet somehow, what remains is precious.

[Chorus]  
If this isn’t love, then what should I call it?  
I didn’t know.  
Call out just one name of a flower,  
So much that it bursts forth.  
The breath that touches the bloom stops,  
And it’s okay if the pain doesn’t fade, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

[Verse 2]  
With those tired eyes, what do you say?  
I walked, hiding my scars.  
That habit wrapped around shadows,  
I wanted you to notice.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Can I still walk? The taste of the sand lingers,  
On the wet grass from the morning dew.  
Words that visit my restless heart,  
It’s still too early for it to end, right?

[Chorus]  
So that no one feels sad, smiling is  
Something I couldn’t do well.  
Just one, only one, if I could protect it,  
That would have been enough.  
An overly trivial wish won’t disappear,  
A soul that can’t be taken by anyone.

[Bridge]  
What can I compare it to? The scars left on you and me,  
Let’s continue on, even if the flowers haven’t bloomed yet, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

[Chorus]  
If this isn’t love, then what should I call it?  
I didn’t know.  
Call out the name of a flower, trembling with fear,  
If it’s not you, then it won’t do.  
The breath that touches the bloom stops,  
And it’s okay if the pain doesn’t fade.

[Outro]  
An overly trivial wish won’t disappear,  
It won’t stop.
