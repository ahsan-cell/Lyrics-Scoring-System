**Translated Lyrics:**

Crying, being born, a life that resonates,  
Surely filled with joy, it’s smiling within.  
We will surely meet again,  
Hand in hand, pushing each other forward, we’ll meet again.

Surely someday, even today will hold meaning, just listen closely,  
If you lend an ear.

With each day that passes without seeing the stars,  
We’ll come to know the meaning of lighting each other’s way.  
Oh beloved, dear friend,  
Your cheers echo far and wide.

Tomorrow will surely bring good weather,  
May the blue spring be just the same.

In this blank story, what will we draw?  
With whom will we create it?

In these starless days, whenever I feel lost,  
I’ll come to understand the meaning of someone shining a light.  
Oh beloved, dear friend,  
You are the cheer itself.

Long ago, look, even a thousand years before,  
We named the stars so we wouldn’t lose our way.  
To me, more than anyone, there’s a star that shines, look,  
In the sky before dawn.

Sometimes behind me, a shining star,  
Walking alongside my stretched shadow.  
Forever, a cheer.

Morning, noon, and night, always there,  
In the darkness, hear it resonate, the brightest star.  
To those I love, to friends I can call dear,  
Let’s meet with cheers.  
Oh beloved, dear friend,  
In the starlight, echoes the cheer.
