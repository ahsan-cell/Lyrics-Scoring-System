**[Intro]**  
I found the reason to grow strong,  
Take me with you and move on.  

**[Verse 1]**  
Dizzy from the muddy carousel, my heart is tense,  
My trembling hands want to grasp something, that’s all there is.  
Even if I stare at the night’s scent (I'll spend all thirty nights),  
Only I can change myself, that’s all there is.  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
I found the reason to grow strong,  
Take me with you and move on.  

**[Chorus]**  
No matter what,  
The dreams I can't erase, the present I can't stop,  
If I can grow strong for someone else,  
Thank you, sorrow,  
I learned the meaning of losing to a world that beats me down.  
Oh, crimson flower, bloom proudly! Illuminate my fate.  

**[Verse 2]**  
The noise of thunder pierces my ears, my heart is confused,  
Is there something that can’t be protected just by being kind? I know it well,  
Good and evil intertwine beneath the surface,  
Transparent hypocrisy brings divine punishment.  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, tell me, I don't need you!  
A single flower that blooms from continuous challenges is more beautiful than a gifted one.  

**[Chorus]**  
Even on a path strewn with thorns,  
Only the serious me will see it through, I’ll overcome it.  
The dreams I couldn’t protect, easily dismissed,  
Take root in this crimson heart, dwelling in this blood.  

**[Bridge]**  
Unseen and fleeting, the ending fades away,  
The wind carries the screams that have been cruelly torn apart.  
Shadows of someone laughing, the cries of another,  
Everyone wishes for happiness.  

**[Chorus]**  
No matter what,  
The dreams I can't erase, the present I can't stop,  
If I can grow strong for someone else,  
Thank you, sorrow,  
I learned the meaning of losing to a world that beats me down.  
Oh, crimson flower, bloom proudly! Illuminate my fate.
