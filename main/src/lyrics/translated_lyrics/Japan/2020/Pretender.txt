**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
A love story with you,  
Just as I expected.  
Once it begins, it’s a one-man show,  
Even when you’re right beside me,  
In the end, I’m just an audience member.

[Verse 2]  
Emotionless "I’m sorry,"  
That’s how it always goes.  
Once I get used to it, it’s not so bad,  
But our romance is like life itself,  
I’ve come to know it won’t continue.

[Pre-Chorus]  
If only we could meet in a different setting,  
In a different kind of relationship,  
It would have been nice to choose a world line.  
If only I had a different personality,  
With a different perspective on love,  
It would be great to express it,  
But wishing for that is pointless.

[Chorus]  
Goodbye,  
You’re not the one destined for me.  
It’s painful but undeniable, yet hard to let go.  
Just touching your hair brings pain, oh no,  
But it’s sweet, oh no.  
Goodbye,  
So what do you mean to me?  
I don’t know the answer, nor do I want to.  
If there’s just one thing I can be sure of,  
It’s that “You are beautiful.”

[Verse 3]  
Someone speaks arrogantly about the logic of love,  
But nothing resonates with me.  
Looking down from an airplane window,  
It feels like the night view of an unfamiliar city.

[Pre-Chorus]  
If only we could meet in a different setting,  
In a different kind of relationship,  
Holding onto a love that came true with a pure heart,  
It would be nice to say “I love you” irresponsibly,  
But wishing for that is empty.

[Chorus]  
Goodbye,  
Beyond the hands we held is the end line.  
Every time I stretch it out, the future aches,  
And you’re not in that reality, Cry…  
It’s surely painful.

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]  
Goodbye,  
You’re not the one destined for me.  
It’s painful but undeniable, yet hard to let go.  
Just touching your hair brings pain, oh no,  
But it’s sweet, oh no.  
Goodbye,  
So what do you mean to me?  
I don’t know the answer, nor do I want to.  
If there’s just one thing I can be sure of,  
It’s that “You are beautiful.”

[Outro]  
If all of this is the fate of romance,  
It’s not so bad.  
There are no promises of eternity,  
But “You are very beautiful.”
