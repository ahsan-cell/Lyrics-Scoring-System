**Translated Lyrics:**

I can’t tell my boyfriend or my family  
All the various things,  
But because you listened to me,  
I could endure any loneliness or fate.

Who else but you could make me laugh  
As I cry, beaten by the never-ending rain?

Always,  
So close that I couldn’t say, “I love you.”  
With a spell to turn back time in my heart, I go on today.

We’ve kissed and gone just a little further,  
But we’re not a couple that fits into the frame of romance.  
(That’s how it is, that’s how it is, that’s how it is.)

Seeing you cry after being rejected by the one you love,  
It’s a happiness to be the only one who can comfort you.

But still,  
I wanted to hold you tight and say, “I love you.”  
With a spell to turn back time in my heart, I go on today.

I’ve always wanted to ask, but couldn’t, about your feelings—  
Whose lies was I telling to protect?

The chances I missed have given me  
Surprisingly much.  
Spilled water cannot return to the glass, it cannot return.  
I want to tell the two of us from when we first met  
That we are more charming now than we were back then, more charming.

My friend,  
Let’s stop realizing things only after we’ve lost them.  
I’ll give you a spell to turn back time.

If I turn back time,  
Will you be mine?  
If I turn back time…
