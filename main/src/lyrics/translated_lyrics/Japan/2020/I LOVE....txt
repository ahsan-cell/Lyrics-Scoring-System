**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In the scenery that I gaze upon,  
Since you entered, the world has transformed,  
In the midst of days I handled with ease,  
I crumble, unable to resist this strange gravity.

[Refrain]  
I love, I almost say,  
But then I stop,  
I love, I love, again and again.

[Pre-Chorus]  
In the rising tide of love, amidst changing feelings,  
Your radiant form shines brightly,  
Like diving into an aquarium,  
Like melted paint, so irregular.

[Chorus]  
I wouldn’t have noticed anything alone,  
In such vivid colors,  
I was about to tell you,  
Who plays it off as normal,  
I love, let me send you the rest.

[Verse 2]  
You laugh at things unseen,  
And here I am, unable to part,  
So beautiful it blinds my eyes,  
Even now, I live bound by inferiority.

[Refrain]  
I love, I love, this awkward knot,  
I love, I love, finding it by touch,  
I love, your love, untangling and intertwining,  
I keep repeating it, over and over.

[Chorus]  
A galaxy adorned only with replicas,  
In the darkness made by curtains, no one laments,  
In this mouse-gray city,  
I love, holding onto that proof.  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)

[Verse 3]  
Joy and sorrow,  
Thoughts without punctuation,  
Rather than sharing completely,  
If we can acknowledge each other, even in ambiguity.

[Bridge]  
In overlapping love, amidst murky emotions,  
In the brief moments between blinks,  
The gift you gave me is this,  
An oddly gentle world, so irregular.

[Chorus]  
I wouldn’t have noticed anything alone,  
In such precious light,  
I was about to tell you,  
Who plays it off as normal,  
I love, let me send you the rest.

[Outro]  
We receive each other,  
As the nameless night deepens.
