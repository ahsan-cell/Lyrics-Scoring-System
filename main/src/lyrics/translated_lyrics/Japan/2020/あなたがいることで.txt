**Translated Lyrics:**

What words can I use  
To convey my feelings to you now?  
Though I'm clumsy,  
I hope they reach you somehow.  

When tomorrow fades from sight,  
And believing feels so frightful,  
I’ve regretted the past and blamed myself,  
But you’ve loved me all this while.  

Even if tomorrow the world should end,  
And days apart stretch on without end,  
I will always think of you, my friend.  

The smile you gave me that day  
Gave me strength and courage to stay.  
Even on lonely nights when stars are out of sight,  
Just having you here makes everything right,  
And I feel I can be strong.  

When our eyes meet, we share a smile,  
Being together makes life worthwhile.  
The days we spent side by side  
Are treasures I hold deep inside.  

Though the cold headwinds may blow,  
And I might forget, feeling low,  
In the ordinary days we've passed through,  
Our happiness was surely there too.  

If in the endless night you cry alone,  
Remember how you believed in me,  
Next, I’ll hold your hand tightly,  
Just like you did for me.  

I used to run from pain and fear,  
But it’s your tears that moved my heart near.  
You showed me your weakness for the first time,  
And it opened my eyes to love's climb.  

One day you spoke of a future bright,  
Where we could be together in the light.  
With you by my side, any tomorrow can shine,  
Even on lonely nights when stars don’t align,  
I believe we’ll laugh again,  
Right here, in this moment, my friend.
