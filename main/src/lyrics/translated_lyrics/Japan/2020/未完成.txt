**Translated Lyrics:**

I want you to break it all, everything  
Throw away the past and laugh it off  
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay  

You call me a "liar"  
Of course, you push me away  
So I won't dream anymore  

If emotions go too far  
And start to rampage,  
Then it would be better to erase me from this world  

How incomplete I am  
I don’t know what to do  
If I can’t be saved, then don’t let me be born  

Stop the love, run away from me  
You can deny it all, everything  
If this continues, I’ll break you  
Is that okay? Is that okay? Is that okay?  
Don’t ever look back  
I hope you find happiness  
I’m sorry for loving you, someone like me.  
Now, I’m free  

While saying “show me the truth”  
We hide from each other, deceiving two  

Unnecessarily, you hurt me  
But only with my love can I fill your loneliness  

How incomplete you are  
I don’t know what to do  
We’re so alike, aren’t we?  

Hold your breath, run away from me  
I want you to forget it all, everything  
No matter where you live  
I love you, I love you, I love you  
Even though you’re crying  
Hey, why can’t I cry?  
I’m sorry for loving you irresponsibly.  

Everything is  
Rushing in, pulling back  
Uncertain  

Please return my normal days  
I want it to end, but I can’t  
It’s okay, you decide  
Stop the love, run away from me  
I want you to break it all, everything  
Throw away the past and laugh it off  
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay  
Don’t ever look back  
I hope you find happiness  
I’m sorry for loving you, someone like me.  

Hold your breath, run away from me  
I want you to forget it all, everything  
No matter where you live  
I love you, I love you, I love you  
The world that only we can see  
Seems too fragile  
When you smile and say, “I’m glad we met”  
Now, I’m free  

Now, I’m free.
