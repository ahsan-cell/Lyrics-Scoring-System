**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
In the middle of the night, suddenly, why is it raining?  
It’s been about three years since I last saw you, what happened?  
Back then, we felt like we could do anything together.  
We took so many pictures when we went to the beach.

[Pre-Chorus]  
But look at me now,  
I’ve become a wreck,  
Even if I hurt others and make them cry again,  
I can’t feel anything at all.

[Chorus]  
I’m not really looking for you,  
But when you’re nearby, I remember.  
Your Dolce & Gabbana,  
It’s all because of that fragrance.

[Post-Chorus]  
(Du-du-du-du, du-du-du  
Du-du-du-du-du)

[Verse 2]  
Now that I see you again,  
What should I say?  
You’ve become so cute,  
But I can only say it with my lips.  
What’s wrong? It’s so sudden.  
I’ve started smoking and such,  
I’m not sad, I’m not sad,  
It’s just that you’ve changed.

[Pre-Chorus]  
But look at me now,  
I’m empty inside,  
Lying to people, being looked down upon,  
Not even a single tear comes out.

[Chorus]  
I’m not really looking for you,  
But when you’re nearby, I remember.  
Your Dolce & Gabbana,  
It’s all because of that fragrance.  
I shouldn’t fall in love with you again,  
That’s impossible,  
But your Dolce & Gabbana,  
That scent brings back memories.

[Bridge]  
Even if there’s nothing left,  
I don’t think about wanting to go back to those fun times,  
But when I see your eyes, I think.

[Chorus]  
I’m not really looking for you,  
But when you’re nearby, I remember.  
Your Dolce & Gabbana,  
It’s all because of that fragrance.  
I shouldn’t fall in love with you again,  
You’re such a wonderful person,  
But repeating the same thing again,  
I get pushed away.

[Post-Chorus]  
(Du-du-du-du, du-du-du  
Du-du-du-du-du  
Du-du-du-du, du-du-du  
Du-du-du-du-du)
