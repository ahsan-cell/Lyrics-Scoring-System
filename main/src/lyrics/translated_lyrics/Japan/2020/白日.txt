**Translated Lyrics:**

Sometimes, without realizing it,  
I find myself imitating,  
Time stops, or is stopped,  
Knowing the fear of the thread.

[Verse]  
It’s all pointless, that’s what they say,  
Avduru, igii, Kakyouin, Joseph,  
Polnareff will come later, no worries,  
I’ll take care of the leftover Jotaro.

[Pre-Chorus]  
What can DIO do right now?  
Even if time is stopped,  
If Star Platinum can still move,  
It’s just a lot of pointless chatter,  
If it’s Jotaro, he can keep going like this,  
Can he really stop time with his stand?  
By then, surely,  
This DIO will be dead.

[Chorus]  
Do you remember how many loaves of bread you’ve eaten until now?  
Before you say such lines,  
Jotaro is stopping time,  
The world and Star Platinum,  
Ora ora and pointless chatter,  
I threw out the road roller to deliver the final blow,  
Furou fushi,  
Stand power!

[Outro]  
Wha...what's happening to my body!?  
DIO!
