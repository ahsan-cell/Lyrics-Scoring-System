**Translated Lyrics:**

The days that began amidst a pile of cardboard  
Are passing by, just a little busier than I imagined.  

This room, which knows nothing of tidiness,  
Feels like it’s borrowed from someone else’s life.  

On a blank notebook,  
I start to write the first letter,  
With a heart soaked in ink mixed with anticipation and anxiety.  

As my two feet step out in alternating rhythm,  
What kind of future asphalt will I tread upon?  

Worn down soles, beyond the door,  
The ideal image still feels distant, uncertain, and blurred,  
But I’ll show you a path that overtakes it someday,  
Surely, someday.  
Surely, someday.  

Every time I look back at my chaotic past full of misunderstandings,  
I feel a bit itchy about my immaturity.  

Yet, in the strength of not knowing the template for a future drawn with a ruler,  
For some reason, we find ourselves mysteriously saved.  
I recognized your voice right away,  
Someone’s humming echoed in the dark room,  
You must have always been here.  

The lullaby you passed down to me from long ago,  
If it’s a dream secretly breathing in my chest pocket,  
I’ll make sure to fulfill it properly,  
Let’s make a firm vow,  
Right now.  

As my two feet step out in alternating rhythm,  
What kind of future asphalt will I tread upon?  

Worn down soles, beyond the door,  
The ideal image still feels distant, uncertain, and blurred,  
But I can draw a path that overtakes it.  

And far ahead,  
Somewhere, I’ll shine bright,  
So that I won’t lose my way,  
Surely, someday.  
Surely, someday.
