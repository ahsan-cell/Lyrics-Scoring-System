**Translated Lyrics:**

No matter how many times I lose, I’ll show you I can get it back  
Like the smile on your face after the rain, with a rainbow in the sky  
Even if it means clouding someone else's expression as a price to pay, that’s fine  
I’ll be the only villain here  

Truthfully, I always want to care for everyone  
But I have to throw away such leisurely ideals right here and now  

How much of the fear aimed at you, far ahead, can I shake off?  
With doubts lingering, caught up in appearances, yesterday feels so heavy  
This hand trembling in my pocket still can’t forget  

Saying, “No matter how many times I get hurt, it can’t be helped,”  
You looked down, shedding fleeting, lukewarm tears  
Just a single drop was enough to drown me in my inadequacy, stealing my reason  

The city’s horns and sirens don’t reach me at all  

Move forward, even if the world points fingers at this selfish love  
I’ll push on without looking back, rushing desperately to you  
Pretending not to hear the SOS that echoed along the way  

Goodbye, yesterday, I’m sorry, but I must go,  
Even if I’m not the same as the dream I once had  
For just one person, you alone, I longed for the strength to protect above all else, and now it’s in my hands  

Move forward, even if the world points fingers at this childish love  
Without hesitation, let’s advance into our own universe  
With this hand that trembled in my pocket, I’ll take you out now  
The future me doesn’t know, so my gaze won’t stop  
Your mysterious expressions, your profound temperament  
Even when “I love you” feels like it might be swept away by the wind  
This hand, clumsily intertwined, will never let go  
Towards the end of the rainbow.
