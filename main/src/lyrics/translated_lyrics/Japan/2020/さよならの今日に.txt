**Translated Lyrics:**

A past covered in mud  
Clings to my everyday life  
With feet grown dull,  
I climb a mountain with no end in sight.  

The longing I felt for love,  
Waking from dreams only to dream again,  
As if to cut out the past,  
Thoughts swirl around in my mind.  

I know tomorrow will come,  
And I understand yesterday won’t return.  
If possible, I’d like to start over, but…  

If what I’ve cast aside has led me to now,  
I won’t say something selfish like “once more,”  
Yet still, somewhere deep down, I seek something.  
An immortal rock star,  
An eternal king—  
How would he have lived tomorrow?  

The scarred sky  
Stains today in a peculiar way.  
With feet grown dull,  
I trace the riverbank as I walk.  

I understand that tears can flow,  
And I know feelings won’t come back.  
If that’s the case, I want to give up, but…  

If what remains could change the now,  
I won’t utter such pity as “once more,”  
Yet still, somewhere deep down, I wish for something.  
A legendary boxer,  
That mysterious one—  
How did he overcome tomorrow?  

Let the blowing wind take me,  
Close your eyes and dance.  
Gaze at the sky tinted with sweet cocktail colors;  
I can hear such voices.  

Even if I gather what I’ve cast aside,  
I know it will never return again,  
Yet I still understand that…  

If what I’ve cast aside has led me to now,  
I won’t say something selfish like “once more,”  
Yet still, somewhere deep down, I seek something.  
An immortal rock star,  
An eternal king—  
How would he have lived tomorrow?  
A legendary boxer,  
That mysterious one—  
How did he overcome tomorrow?
