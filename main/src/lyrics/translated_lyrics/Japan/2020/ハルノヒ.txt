**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
At the platform of Kitasenju station,  
A silver ticket gate,  
Sharing memories and diving deep into thoughts,  
On a bench we leaned,  
We couldn’t see anything,  
Swearing to each other about the future.

[Verse 2]  
The trees braving the cold and a cat,  
Seem to sway as if for us,  
Trying to bloom like buds,  
Smiling beautifully,  
No need to rush,  
One day, let it become a bouquet for us.

[Pre-Chorus]  
So please wait until then,  
We’ll explore what’s next together,  
Let’s spend time until we’re bored,  
While conveying our limited love.

[Chorus]  
What kind of future  
Is peeking in from here?  
If we share your strength and my weakness,  
What amazing things might happen?  
Look,  
I’m so happy now,  
Sometimes alone, sometimes together,  
Let’s keep cherishing what’s important.

[Verse 2]  
Walking lightly through Kitasenju station,  
In a sky-blue skirt,  
Always far away,  
The sound of footsteps quickens,  
I felt like I shouldn’t be too honest.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Indulging too much in kindness,  
With the back of a man who’s too obedient,  
It’s only you who can hold my palm,  
So you must walk ahead.

[Chorus]  
I wish the future  
Would wave its hand to us,  
As I continue searching for a place  
To return to without feeling awkward,  
Look,  
The sunset is so beautiful now,  
When I recall the light from the past,  
I’ll surely notice what’s important.

[Bridge]  
No need to rush,  
One day, let it become a bouquet for us,  
We couldn’t see anything,  
Swearing to each other about the future.

[Chorus]  
What kind of future  
Is peeking in from here?  
If we share your strength and my weakness,  
What amazing things might happen?  
Look, I’m so happy now,  
Sometimes alone, sometimes together,  
No, even more,  
Shall we keep cherishing what’s important?

[Outro]  
At the familiar station platform,  
A watery greeting,  
“Welcome back,”  
Stepping on the small swaying shadows of happiness.
