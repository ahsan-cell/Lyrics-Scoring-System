**Translated Lyrics:**

I can’t become someone else,  
I know that much is true.  
I want to believe in tomorrow,  
Even if I couldn’t love the faint version of me.

Tee-Tee-Tee-Tee-Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever.

Tee-Tee-Tee-Tee-Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever.

Not everything we wish for will come true,  
I understand that too.  
Deep wounds will eventually turn to scabs,  
Will they peel away in time?

Still, I find myself telling the same boring stories,  
Searching for happiness within the mundane.

Though my feelings overflow,  
I don’t know how to express them, still searching for words.  
If only I could notice the scattered pieces of dreams,  
And your dazzling sparkle that captivates me.

Tee-Tee-Tee-Tee-Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever.

Tee-Tee-Tee-Tee-Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever.

In the end, no one teaches us,  
Which path we should take.  
Let’s live just as we are,  
Even as we grow older.

Still, I find myself telling the same boring stories,  
Searching for happiness within the mundane.  
Look for the sparkle.

Being tossed around and tossed about,  
Without realizing that what matters is you.  
Rather than worrying about what the future holds,  
If only I could notice the dazzling present.

Tee-Tee-Tee-Tee-Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever.  
Tee-Tee-Tee-Tee-Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever,  
Teenager forever.

I can’t become someone else,  
I know that much is true.  
I want to believe in tomorrow,  
Even if I couldn’t love the faint version of me.
