**Translated Lyrics:**

Perhaps I’ll wander down the path,  
Circling through the Aoba forest,  
Playing around in the sunlit town,  
Someone is calling out to me.

As summer comes, shadows rise, I want to see you,  
What I found was the first star,  
I wonder if tomorrow will be clear.

When the paprika flowers bloom,  
Let’s sow seeds in the bright sky,  
If I can paint a dream of sunshine,  
Let my heart play and reach out to you.

In the rain, the moonlight dims,  
Who was crying in the shade?  
To comfort each and every one,  
Someone is calling out to me.  
If I count the joys, they’re all you,  
The light that illuminated my way home  
Was the shadow of memories.

When the paprika flowers bloom,  
Let’s sow seeds in the bright sky,  
If I can paint a dream of sunshine,  
Let my heart play and reach out to you.

I’m heading towards love, breaking through the branches,  
Singing a song,  
Holding a bunch of flowers in my hands,  
La ru ra ri ra.

I’m heading towards love, breaking through the branches,  
Singing a song,  
Holding a bunch of flowers in my hands,  
La ru ra ri ra.

When the paprika flowers bloom,  
Let’s sow seeds in the bright sky,  
If I can paint a dream of sunshine,  
Let my heart play and reach out to you.

Let your toes dance, stop this finger.
