### Translated Lyrics

**Part I: Miley Cyrus - Bangerz**

[Intro: Miley Cyrus]  
Bangerz (Bangerz)  
(Mike WiLL Made-It)  
Freakin' bangerz (Bangerz)  
(Ear Drummers)  
Bangerz (Bangerz)  
Freak-freak-freakin' bangerz (Bangerz)  

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]  
All the way in the back with a tree on my lap  
All the boys like to ask me, "What you doing with that?"  
Yeah, yeah  
You say you love me, I ain't falling for that  
They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack  
One day he wants me  
One day he wants me not  
I don't take chances, 'cause time just ain't what I got  
If he's like that, I got a world tour that they need me at  
I can't be sittin' 'round here waitin' on a man  
To tell me where the hell my seat be at  
Where Mike WiLL at?  

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Freakin' bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Freakin' bangerz)  

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & (Miley Cyrus)]  
I'm flying high up on the bird; acrophobiac  
I slick, caught her eyeing down my purse  
Where the dollars at?  
I let her know the rent's due on the first  
They can call the hearse  
'Cause if there's any violation, I go off with that  
Catwalk, slick talk, flirting with a big dog  
(Why I need his millions when I got Billy on speed dial?)  
You know I'm on that "meow," quick to scratch your eyes out  
Strutting on the court, make them nervous, call a timeout  

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Freakin' bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (I be struttin' my stuff)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Bangerz)  
We be struttin' that stuff, that stuff, that stuff (Freakin' bangerz)  

[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]  
The plane, boss, the plane  
â€˜Bout to get that big rock  
Slip that on my hand  
Make that media big talk  
The plane, boss, the plane  
Psych, that must be the purple  
Got up in my brain  
Had me a little bit dismal  

[Outro: Miley Cyrus]  
I, I, I (Bangerz)  
I, I, I (Freakin' bangerz)  
I, I, I (Bangerz)  
I, I, I (Freakin' bangerz)  
I, I, I  
I, I, I  
I, I, I  
I, I, I

**Part II: Silversun Pickups - Lazy Eye**

[Verse 1: Silversun Pickups, Miley Cyrus]  
I've been waiting  
I've been waiting for this moment all my life  
But it's not quite right  
And this "real"  
It's impossible, if possible, at whose blind word?  
So clear, but so unheard  
Bangerz, Bangerz  

[Verse 2]  
I've been waiting  
I've been waiting for this silence all night long  
It's just a matter of time  
To appear sad  
With the same ol' decent lazy eye fixed to rest on you  
Aim free, but so untrue
