**Translated Lyrics:**

Just give a little space in your heart,  
Take me in just a little,  
Adorn your dreams with me,  
Nestle me in your memories.

I want you, my love, endlessly,  
I’m devoted to you, my love, endlessly.

[Instrumental-break]

[Chorus]  
Just give a little space in your heart,  
Take me in just a little,  
Adorn your dreams with me,  
Nestle me in your memories.

[Instrumental-break]

[Verse 1]  
I would place this world at your feet,  
My love is madness,  
There’s no lover like me for you,  
You are my devotion.

[Chorus]  
I want you, my love, endlessly,  
I’m devoted to you, my love, endlessly.

[Instrumental-break]

[Verse 2]  
Just say it, just say what’s hidden in your heart,  
What you desire,  
Don’t keep any veil from me, oh dear,  
Let my faith be yours.

[Chorus]  
I want you, my love, endlessly,  
I’m devoted to you, my love, endlessly.
