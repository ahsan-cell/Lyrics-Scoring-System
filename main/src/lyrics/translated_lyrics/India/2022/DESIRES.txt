**Translated Lyrics:**

Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  

[Verse 1: AP Dhillon]  
Why did the thorns prick my heart?  
Tell me something about it.  
I want to see you happy,  
So tell me how to make it happen.  
In the afternoon sun, my heart is exposed,  
Like clouds that are ready to burst.  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  

[Chorus]  
Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  
Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  

[Verse 2: Gurinder Gill]  
Eyes like a doe,  
They have my name written in them.  
My heart feels something,  
As if the gentle winds have paused.  
Carefree faces,  
Why do they remain so indifferent?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  

[Chorus]  
Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  
Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  

[Verse 3: AP Dhillon]  
Why is the evening sky red?  
It’s because of your colors.  
I still want to tell you,  
If there’s a story caught in a net.  
Truly, the redness of your words,  
Is reflected in my blush.  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  

Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?  
Let go of your anger now,  
Why do your eyes fill with tears?  
Why does it wander in conversation,  
Like an elephant that has lost its way?
