♪
Brother  
Brother  
♪  
Hey, the jasmine flower is wilting away,  
That silver moon keeps coming and searching.  
Brother, when will you come?  
Brother, when will you come?  
The ten-headed serpent is about to give a kiss,  
I’ve been lost in thoughts of you.  
Every day, it’s only in dreams that I meet you.  
Hey, when will you come?  
Brother, when will you come?  
The ten-headed serpent is about to fall down.  
♪  
I can’t see the beauty at the doorway,  
I’m longing for water but can’t find any.  
I searched far and wide for the Chola (a historical dynasty),  
A burden in my heart that won’t ease.  
Waiting and waiting, my eyes will bloom,  
With tears, my heart sails like a ship.  
(Sing, sing, sing, sing)  
(Sing, sing, sing, sing)  
Hey, the jasmine flower is wilting away,  
That silver moon keeps coming and searching.  
Brother, when will you come?  
Brother, when will you come?  
Brother, when will you come?  
The ten-headed serpent, serpent, serpent,  
Is about to give a kiss, kiss, kiss.  
The ten-headed serpent is going to give a kiss, brother.  
Hey, brother-brother-brother-brother, brother, brother,  
When will brother leave?  
When will brother leave?  
When will brother, when will brother  
Leave?  
Is the distance turning into sorrow?  
Living nearby feels like enough,  
Time passes with desires,  
A rooster crows, and sleep escapes.  
You’re there, and I’m here—what kind of life is this?  
It’s enough, enough; we’ll meet without saying a word.  
Hey, the jasmine flower is wilting away,  
That silver moon keeps coming and searching.  
Brother, when will you come?  
Brother, when will you come?  
Looking towards the north, I too will be lost,  
Oh, how many days has this longing been?  
In a deep breath, the cloth dances, the fabric burns,  
Like a secret love,  
I must speak softly,  
If I hear noise, I must pretend to sleep.  
Brother, when will you come?  
Brother, when will you come?  
Without saying anything, what will you let me fall into?
