**The sky is now swirling,  
Lightning flashes in my home,  
The moon spills over us,  
In that moment I saw you.  
The city has lost its charm,  
No food can satisfy me,  
I’m just a wanderer.  
Oh, the breeze from your place,  
Is walking alongside me,  
The sound of my rooster crowing,  
Is calling out to you.**

**Oh, my heart is trembling,  
The sky is now swirling,  
Lightning flashes in my home,  
The moon spills over us.**

**Your touch is like a breeze,  
It doesn’t fade away,  
My heart is restless,  
Like a festival's tales,  
I am the one who brings joy.  
When you come into my life,  
What will happen to me?  
You are the flame that ignites,  
And I am the wax that melts.**

**Oh, my heart is trembling,  
The sky is now swirling,  
Lightning flashes in my home,  
The moon spills over us.  
In that moment I saw you,  
The city has lost its charm,  
No food can satisfy me,  
I’m just a wanderer.  
Oh, the breeze from your place,  
Is walking alongside me,  
The sound of my rooster crowing,  
Is calling out to you.**
