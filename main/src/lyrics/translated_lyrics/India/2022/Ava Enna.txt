---

**What is she searching for?**
She watches closely, waiting, waiting for her chance.
She speaks beautifully, but her words fall flat.
Oh, right now, I need her so much.
Without her, it’s just a burning fire.

**What is she searching for?**
She watches closely, waiting, waiting for her chance.
She speaks beautifully, but her words fall flat.
Oh, right now, I need her so much.
Without her, it’s just a burning fire.

**In one heart, there’s another; standing in my heart.**
**Little by little, it grows, my life is scattered.**
When she says a single word, it shines like a spark.
What can I say? She’s like a thorn in my side.

**In one heart, there’s another; standing in my heart.**
What can I say? She’s like a thorn in my side.
Like a flower that blooms, oh, I’m lost in its beauty.
No peace in my dreams, just a longing to hold on.

**Somewhere, we’re connected, caught in this web.**
Oh, my beloved, we’ve danced together.
With my eyes closed, I reach out, pulling you close.
Still searching for her.

**Where is she, my golden girl?**
**Where is she, my golden girl?**
**Where is she, my golden girl?**

**What is she searching for?**
She watches closely, waiting, waiting for her chance.
She speaks beautifully, but her words fall flat.
Oh, right now, I need her so much.
Without her, it’s just a burning fire.

**Life gives us a ring, spinning day by day.**
It goes up and down, tied to this fate.
From the heights of joy, I fell down low,
Like a fish out of water, struggling to breathe.

Who will come to join me? Who will walk with me?
No one knows who they are, it’s all in our hands.
A light was given by someone,
But she stopped in the darkness.

**Where is she going alone?**
**Where is she going alone?**
**Where is she going alone?**

**What is she searching for?**
She watches closely, waiting, waiting for her chance.
She speaks beautifully, but her words fall flat.
Oh, right now, I need her so much.
Without her, it’s just a burning fire.

**In one heart, there’s another; standing in my heart.**
**Little by little, it grows, my life is scattered.**
When she says a single word, it shines like a spark.
What can I say? She’s like a thorn in my side.
