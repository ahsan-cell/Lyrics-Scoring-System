**Translated Lyrics:**

(Eh boys, boys–)  
(At a slow pace of life–)

**[Chorus: AP Dhillon]**  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.

**[Verse 1: AP Dhillon]**  
They'll make you go wild,  
And leave you feeling alone among the crowd.  
Where's the truth in all this?  
They'll get you high without a drink.

**[Pre-Chorus: AP Dhillon]**  
Your beauty has them defeated,  
The dark ones are wandering around.  
In conversations, don’t just clap; listen and don’t speak.

**[Chorus: AP Dhillon]**  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.

**[Verse 2: Shinda Kahlon]**  
Don’t be afraid to flirt from your balcony,  
Look, look, my heart is melting for you.  
Electricity strikes the hearts of these boys,  
Even the moonlight bows down before you.

**[Pre-Chorus: Shinda Kahlon]**  
Stars have fallen from above,  
Your charm is hard to resist.  
May the world not cast an evil eye, just sit with me.

**[Chorus: Shinda Kahlon]**  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe (stay safe).  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.

**[Verse 3: Gurinder Gill]**  
Just listen to what I say,  
I’ll keep you safe from the fire.  
I’ll protect you,  
So that no delays come your way.

**[Pre-Chorus: Gurinder Gill]**  
They’re wandering around looking for you,  
High on their own desires.  
What’s in a name when they’re all out there chasing you?

**[Chorus: Gurinder Gill, Shinda Kahlon & AP Dhillon]**  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.  
These boys are all crazy,  
With big talks and grand gestures.  
At this slow pace of life, you better stay safe.
