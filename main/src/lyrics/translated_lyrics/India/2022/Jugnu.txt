**Translated Lyrics:**

When you're not near, I can't breathe right  
I feel irritable, nothing seems special in sight  
Since I've started to love you, there's no hope left for me, oh-oh-oh  
Since you came into my life, the vibe has completely changed  
I used to wander aimlessly, now my life is arranged  
In my dark world, your light has ignited a flame, yeah, hey, ayy, yeah  

**[Pre-Chorus: Badshah]**  
In your words, my heart has lost its way  
In my nights, day has found its play  
What we call love has finally come to stay  
Finally, finally, finally  

**[Chorus: Badshah]**  
I'm no longer shy like before, now I don't understand anything anymore  
Tell me, what should I do now?  
Sleep has vanished from my eyes  
Why am I so happy?  
Why should I give you my attention?  
I don’t know what’s happened to me  
In your love, I shine like a firefly  

**[Verse 2: Nikhita Gandhi]**  
Even the clouds take shapes of my heart  
Happiness has settled in my pocket, playing its part  
There's joy in losing; it's a game we play  
Your situation and mine are the same today  

**[Pre-Chorus: Nikhita Gandhi]**  
In your words, my heart has lost its way  
In my nights, day has found its play  
What we call love has finally come to stay  
Finally, finally, finally  

**[Chorus: Nikhita Gandhi, Badshah, Both]**  
I'm no longer shy like before, now I don't understand anything anymore  
Tell me, what should I do now?  
Sleep has vanished from my eyes  
Why am I so happy?  
Why should I give you my attention?  
I don’t know what’s happened to me  
In your love, I shine like a firefly  

**[Refrain: Nikhita Gandhi, Badshah, Both]**  
Now you're far from me (Nothing was there before you)  
No one can take your place (Nothing will be after you)  
Why think about what’s to come? (This hand in your hand)  
Whatever happens, we’ll see (Let the world go to hell)  

Now you're far from me (Nothing was there before you)  
No one can take your place (Nothing will be after you)  
Why think about what’s to come? (This hand in your hand)  
Whatever happens, we’ll see...  

**[Chorus: Badshah]**  
I'm no longer shy like before, now I don't understand anything anymore  
Tell me, what should I do now?  
Sleep has vanished from my eyes  
Why am I so happy?  
Why should I give you my attention?  
I don’t know what’s happened to me  
In your love, I shine like a firefly  

**[Outro]**  
It's your boy Badshah!
