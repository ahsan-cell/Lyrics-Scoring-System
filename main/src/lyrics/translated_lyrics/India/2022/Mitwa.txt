**Translated Lyrics:**

Know this, my dear  
Love will find a way  
Know this, my dear  

Tell me, my heart, where are you headed?  
What haven’t you found?  
What are you searching for?  

What’s left unspoken, what’s unheard,  
What is that truth, tell me?  
Beloved, what do your heartbeats say to you?  
Beloved, don’t hide it from yourself.  

Love will find a way  
Know this, my dear  

Oh, my heart, tell me where you’re going?  
What haven’t you found?  
What are you searching for?  

What’s left unspoken, what’s unheard,  
What is that truth, tell me?  
Beloved, what do your heartbeats say to you?  
Beloved, don’t hide it from yourself.  
Beloved.  

In the journey of life, in the city of love,  
Since someone appeared in sight,  
You wonder, you ask,  
“Is this the one I’ve been missing?”  

Yes, this is the one, yes, this is the one,  
You are thirsty, and this is the river,  
Why not openly express it?  

What’s left unspoken, what’s unheard,  
What is that truth, tell me?  
Beloved, what do your heartbeats say to you?  
Beloved, don’t hide it from yourself.  

Oh, your eyes have found their path,  
But you ponder, should I go or stay?  
This life that dances,  
Why are your feet bound in chains?  

Dance to the tune of love, oh mad one,  
If it flies, let it soar freely,  
Why should anyone deprive themselves like this?  

What’s left unspoken, what’s unheard,  
What is that truth, tell me?  
Beloved, what do your heartbeats say to you?  
Beloved, don’t hide it from yourself.  
My heart, tell me where you’re going?  
What haven’t you found?  
What are you searching for?  

Love will find a way  
Know this, my dear  
Everywhere, every day  
Love will find a way  
Know this, my dear  
Love will find a way  
Know this, my dear  
Love will find a way  
Love will find a way.
