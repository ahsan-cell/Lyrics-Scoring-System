**Translated Lyrics:**

Right now, somewhere within me  
There’s still a little life left  
A new heartbeat has awakened  
Knowing that I’m alive, even now  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
There’s a certain passion in this moment  
Where has this moment been for me?  

**[Chorus]**  
Now it’s right in front of me, let me touch it a bit  
Should I die or live just a little?  
Should I kiss happiness or cry just a little?  
Should I die or live just a little?  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
Oh, right now, somewhere within me  
There’s still a little life left  

**[Instrumental-break]**  

**[Verse 2]**  
Oh, in the scorching sun, my body  
Found shade beneath a tree  
Like the laughter of a sulking child  
It bloomed again with a coaxing smile  
You might also like  
Something similar  
Is what my heart is feeling now  
It’s like a balm on old wounds  
From years gone by  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
There’s a certain grace in this moment  
Where has this moment been for me?  

**[Chorus]**  
Now it’s right in front of me, let me touch it a bit  
Should I die or live just a little?  
Should I kiss happiness or cry just a little?  
Should I die or live just a little?  

**[Instrumental-break]**  

**[Verse 3]**  
Like a kite broken from its string  
That was my life  
Whether today or tomorrow, it may not be mine  
Every day told my story  

A new bond  
Now calls me from behind  
Why does the worry of tomorrow  
Haunt me so?  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
There’s a certain sting in this moment  
Where has this moment been for me?  

**[Chorus]**  
Now it’s right in front of me, let me touch it a bit  
Should I die or live just a little?  
Should I kiss happiness or cry just a little?  
Should I die or live just a little?
