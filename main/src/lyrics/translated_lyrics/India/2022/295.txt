**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**  
Tell me, son, why do you keep your head down?  
You used to smile so brightly, now you're silent somehow.  
Those doors where the boards are stacked,  
I walk through them well, who’s keeping track?  
Some here want silver to shine,  
While others want to pull you down, it’s a sign.  
Some have come here hungry for fame,  
They come forward, taking your name.  
Trouble keeps coming, it never dies,  
Don’t let the world take away your highs.  
And on the paths that you tread,  
Here, infamy is what you'll be fed.

**[Chorus]**  
Daily, controversy will arise,  
Debates in the name of religion, no surprise.  
Speak the truth, and you’ll face 295,  
If you make progress, son, hate will thrive.  
Daily, controversy will arise,  
Debates in the name of religion, no surprise.  
Speak the truth, and you’ll face 295,  
If you make progress, son, hate will thrive.

**[Verse 2]**  
Today, many gather, all thoughts combined,  
He gives voice to ideas that are hard to find.  
It feels like God has raised his hand,  
When I read the news, it’s all so bland.  
Stay quiet, oh sons, don’t reveal the rift,  
The leader here has a right to shift.  
Those who come with their own agenda,  
Keep walking, they’re just a pretender.  
Oh, the lies here are facts, it seems,  
Thieves masquerade as social dreams.  
Dress in truth, while people loot,  
Even the righteous will face the brute.

**[Chorus]**  
Daily, controversy will arise,  
Debates in the name of religion, no surprise.  
Speak the truth, and you’ll face 295,  
If you make progress, son, hate will thrive.  
Daily, controversy will arise,  
Debates in the name of religion, no surprise.  
Speak the truth, and you’ll face 295,  
If you make progress, son, hate will thrive.

**[Verse 3]**  
People hit hard, under the trees they stand,  
In a minute, they reach the wombs of the land.  
Who’s a dog, who’s a fool, who’s a scoundrel here?  
Certificates handed out on Facebook, oh dear!  
Leaders brown, they’ve taken the dough,  
With votes in hand, they put on a show.  
Not sure if they even have a soul,  
They speak without shame, losing control.  
They fall, but keep their heads high,  
What’s the difference, when you look in their eye?  
Your mother’s pride, it’s all in the game,  
Wisdom comes slowly, but it’s never the same.

**[Chorus]**  
Daily, controversy will arise,  
Debates in the name of religion, no surprise.  
Speak the truth, and you’ll face 295,  
If you make progress, son, hate will thrive.

**[Verse 4]**  
Now you’re ahead, but don’t get too bold,  
No one’s taking photos, just stories told.  
Who truly believes in God’s grace?  
People judge based on actions they trace.  
You may have bowed, but don’t lose your way,  
You’re not a fool, don’t let them sway.  
One thing to ask these contractors,  
Our path is ours, not just for actors.  
Remove the dirty politics from your heart,  
Leave behind those who tear us apart.  
For any child, don’t let them stray,  
Or soon enough, they’ll meet a fateful day.

**[Chorus]**  
Daily, controversy will arise,  
Debates in the name of religion, no surprise.  
Speak the truth, and you’ll face 295,  
If you make progress, son, hate will thrive.

**[Verse 5]**  
Media sits, today’s fools at play,  
Spitting the same lies, day after day.  
Sitting with women, gossiping away,  
While judges’ names are thrown into dismay.  
In the evening and morning, disputes arise,  
They create chaos, wearing their disguise.  
24 hours, no sleep in sight,  
And those lonely songs echo through the night.  
Though it’s tough, the crowd’s on your side,  
They shout loud, but don’t let it slide.  
But remember this, my dear son,  
Your father’s proud, you’re second to none.  
You’ve been crushed, but the world will see,  
Rise up, son, be the best
