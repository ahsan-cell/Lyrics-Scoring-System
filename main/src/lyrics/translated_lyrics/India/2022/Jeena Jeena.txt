**Translated Lyrics:**

Where you have placed your steps,  
In your name, my life is written, my companion.  

Yes, I’ve learned how to live, truly live,  
Yes, I’ve learned to live, my companion.  
But I never learned how to live, truly live,  
I never learned to live without you, my companion.  

At the threshold of my heart,  
Where you have placed your steps,  
In your name, my life is written, my companion.  

Yes, I’ve learned how to live, truly live,  
Yes, I’ve learned to live, my companion.  
But I never learned how to live, truly live,  
I never learned to live without you, my companion.  

These praises are sincere,  
From the heart, I have spoken them.  

These praises are sincere,  
From the heart, I have spoken them.  
When you came into my life,  
My world became beautiful, my companion.  

In your name, my life is written, my companion.  
Yes, I’ve learned how to live, truly live,  
Yes, I’ve learned to live, my companion.  
But I never learned how to live, truly live,  
I never learned to live without you, my companion.
