**Translated Lyrics:**

A drenched tale, I tell you now...

When the sky didn’t rain,
Love was pouring down.
The monsoon played a tune,
For which life
Had long yearned for centuries!!

Hey, listen, listen??
A wonderful relationship has come up,
Take a look at this photo.

I really like the girl!!

Mom! I’ll check later,
I’m running very late.

I see you in the evening!!

Like a poet’s heart,
Raindrops fall on you.

What a sight it is,
When your hair dances in the breeze.

Don’t go far away now…

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

In my heart, there’s just one sorrow,
You’re rarely with me.

Yes…

In my heart, there’s just one sorrow,
You’re rarely with me.

Don’t leave right now,
Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

…. Music …..

Huu..

Slowly, gently,
These rains will soak us.

Slowly, gently,
These rains will soak us.

Who knows where
We’ll meet again
For such encounters?

How do I hold my heart together?
It only wants you.
I’m burning in dreams,
Here I am…
Come back as that first rain,
And pour down on us.
Let the winds change direction,
Love me like this.

Don’t break my dream…

Ho Ho
Come on… 
Come on… Come on…

The rain falling on our bodies
Has awakened our souls.
This season’s conspiracy
Has stolen our sleep.

Well, to drown, just
One drop is enough.
Think about it, what will happen?
The night is still young.

Stay with me,
Don’t go…

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

Lightning flashed, we embraced…

The clouds thundered, we gathered…

Lightning flashed, we embraced,
The clouds thundered, we gathered.

Let the senses be,
Forget the worries!

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!

Listen, listen, listen,
To the tune of the rain,
Listen!!
