**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  
Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  

Like a scorching afternoon, a girl like a squirrel  
I’m the one they want, just like you  
I’m a branch full of flowers, a kiss, and a curse too  
Tell me, what do you want, just like you?  

The bed broke on the first night  
The whole neighborhood was talking about it  
It rained in the courtyard  
Who was there? With whom?  

Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  
Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh dear, sparkling, I am so bright  

I adore your little whims and fancies, oh so sweet  
You love my sways and moves, my dear, my dear  
I’m dying, I’m dying now from this fever of love for you  

Keep me, keep me, keep me  
Hold me close, hold me in your heart  
Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  
You’re mine, you’re mine, you’re mine  
I’m yours, I’m yours, I’m yours  

Wild and fierce, like a courtroom drama  
I’m the one they want, just like you  
I’m a shy flower, good and bad too  
Tell me, what do you want, just like you?  

I’m the chaat from Patna, with sixteen flavors  
In my soil lies the fertilizer of love  
Even the neighbors remember  
The fireworks after the evening  

Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  
Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  

Like a scorching afternoon, a girl like a squirrel  
I’m the one they want, just like you  
I’m a branch full of flowers, a kiss, and a curse too  
Tell me, what do you want, just like you?  

The bed broke on the first night  
The whole neighborhood was talking about it  
It rained in the courtyard  
Who was there? With whom?  

Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  
You’re mine, you’re mine, you’re mine  
Oh, I’m yours, I’m yours, I’m yours  

Oh, sparkling, you shine so bright  
Oh, sparkling, I am so bright  
You’re mine, you’re mine, you’re mine  
Oh, I’m yours, I’m yours, I’m yours
