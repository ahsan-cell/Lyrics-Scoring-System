**Translated Lyrics:**

Gone into hiding, my beloved, changing the land  
So far away from me, it feels like a crime  
I keep asking myself,  
"What wrong have I done to you?"

Come back again, just like before  
Make me cry again, just like you did before  
Come back again, just like before  
Come, oh come, my love, come

Come, my eyes are waiting for you  
Beloved, my eyes are waiting for you  
Darling, my eyes are waiting for you  
My dear, my eyes are waiting for you

Oh, my eyes are waiting, my heart beats loudly  
My eyes are waiting, my heart beats loudly  
Come back, my traveler, come back, my traveler  
Come back, my traveler, for the sake of love

Come, my eyes are waiting for you  
My dear, my eyes are waiting for you  
Come

I’ve grown weary on these paths  
I’ve grown weary on these paths  
Counting each moment, my heart endures  
Counting each moment, my heart endures

Come back, my traveler, come back, my traveler  
Come back, my traveler, for the sake of love

Come, my eyes are waiting for you  
Beloved, my eyes are waiting for you  
Darling, my eyes are waiting for you  
My dear, my eyes are waiting for you

I can’t see  
I can’t see God anymore  
Since you’ve been so far away

Beloved, oh come, my heart cries out  
How helpless my heart has become  
You don’t agree, but you are my God  
Oh, God, come home

Without you, yes, without you  
My love, without you, without you  
Without you, my heart, my dear  
Without you, my heart, my dear  
What’s the point of living?  
Without you, my heart, my dear  
What’s the point of living?  
What’s the point of living?

In my veins, oh, in every vein of mine  
In my veins, in every vein of mine  
The drum of your memory beats, saying...

My eyes are waiting, my heart beats loudly  
My eyes are waiting, my heart beats loudly  
Come back, my traveler, come back, my traveler  
Come back, my traveler, for the sake of love
