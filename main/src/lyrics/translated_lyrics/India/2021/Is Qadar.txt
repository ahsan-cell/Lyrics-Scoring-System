**Translated Lyrics:**

I've fallen so deeply in love with you,  
Beyond all limits, I've crossed every line.  
Days now pass in your affection,  
My heart says to meet you every moment.

Let’s sit together forever,  
Drowning in your eyes.  
I've fallen so deeply in love with you,  
Beyond all limits, I've crossed every line.

I’m in love with your memories,  
I’m in love with your words.  
With the dreams that come in your sleep,  
And the meetings we've shared together.

Ooo Ho Ho Oo..  
Ooo Oo Oo Oo..

I’m in love with your touch,  
I’m in love with being yours.  
With my hands in yours,  
Spending days and nights by your side.

Let me gaze upon your face,  
Holding you in my arms.

I've fallen so deeply in love with you,  
Beyond all limits, I've crossed every line.

These eyes tell me,  
To keep watching only you.  
You alone reside in my heart, endlessly boundless.

My heart wishes to give itself to you,  
On paths filled with flowers.  
With every gesture of yours, with every glance,  
I’ve begun to lose myself in you,  
I’ve begun to lose myself in you…

I've fallen so deeply in love with you,  
So much that my heart has surrendered.  
So much that I’ve become restless,  
So much that I’m now intoxicated.

I've fallen so deeply in love with you,  
So much that my heart has surrendered.  
So much that I’ve become restless,  
So much that I’m now intoxicated.
