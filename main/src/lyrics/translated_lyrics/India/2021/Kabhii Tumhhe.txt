**Translated Lyrics:**

I will return  
At your call...

In every journey, I will  
Always be by your side.

If you ever remember me,  
Just brush your hair aside with your lashes,  
I will be clear to you there,  
If I'm not, just let me know.

If I happen to be late,  
Save a little time for me,  
I will meet you again there,  
If I don't, then give me a punishment...!!

My land has been waiting  
For your footsteps for so long.

One day, you must come,  
This is the faith of my heart.

I will ask for nothing else  
From God but you.  
You might also like  
If you ever remember me,  
Just understand this simple thing.

I will meet you again there,  
Just pass through my path.

Ha ha haan  
Ha ha haan  
Ha ha haan

La La La  
La La La  
La La La  
La Lala...!!
