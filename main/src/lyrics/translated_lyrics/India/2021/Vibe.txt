**Translated Lyrics:**

Your vibe and mine connect,  
Your vibe and mine connect,  
People hear my laughter,  
And you listen to the heart's call.  
Your vibe and mine connect,  
Your vibe and mine connect.  

[Verse 1]  
You hold my waist, oh darling,  
We meet in dreams every day, oh darling.  
You hold my waist, oh darling,  
We meet in dreams every day, oh darling.  
You look good in Moncler,  
You look good in Moncler.  
Oh, those who tell me,  
You reside deep in my heart.  

[Chorus]  
You look good in Moncler,  
You look good in Moncler.  

[Verse 2]  
So much love, so much love, don’t be possessive,  
It’ll become overwhelming, oh dear.  
Just a minute, just a minute, don’t go far,  
When it ignites, I can’t breathe, oh dear.  
Love is a big secret,  
Love is a big secret.  
I’ll make you mine forever,  
But don’t let go of my hand.  

[Chorus]  
Love is a big secret,  
Love is a big secret.  

[Verse 3]  
Linking with you feels like magic,  
Pulling off your kurta and pajamas.  
Behind me, they’re whispering,  
About the deeds I’ve done.  
Oh, I’ve broken all barriers,  
Oh, I’ve broken all barriers.  
You’ve become just mine,  
It’s just a small thing.  

[Chorus]  
Oh, I’ve broken all barriers,  
Oh, I’ve broken all barriers.  
Oh, I’ve broken all barriers.
