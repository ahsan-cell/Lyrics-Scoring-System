**Translated Lyrics:**

We won’t fall in love,  
We won’t give our hearts away,  
We won’t be infatuated with anyone.  

This is what we had decided,  
We won’t fall in love,  
We won’t give our hearts away,  
We won’t be infatuated with anyone.  

Your playful eyes,  
Have put me in this state,  
What is this heart of mine?  
If you ask for it, I’d give my life.  

Turning back from the streets of love,  
It’s hard to leave.  

The heart has made a mistake,  
The heart has made a mistake.  

The heart has made a mistake,  
Now tell me, what will happen to us?  

Tell me, what will happen to us?  
Tell me, what will happen to us?  

Tell me, oh beloved,  
What will happen to us?  

Listening to the silence,  
How long will we stay?  
Today is the chance,  
Say something with your lips.  

Life is quite brief,  
Come a little closer,  
Don’t just keep thinking.  

You can accept me or reject me,  
You have the right to decide,  
Why do you ask us?  
What do we have in our hands?  

For we have already decided to go,  
You are in every breath of mine.  

The heart has made a mistake,  
The heart has made a mistake.  

The heart has made a mistake,  
Now tell me, what will happen to us?  

Tell me, what will happen to us?  
Tell me, what will happen to us?  

Tell me, oh beloved,  
What will happen to us?  

The heart has made a mistake,  
The heart has made a mistake.  

Ah, ah...  

For it happened for the first time,  
I made the mistake of seeing you,  
We fell again,  
Made the mistake of wanting love.  

We were stubborn in your love,  
If I were to be killed,  
Then this heart would die for you,  
The last mistake.  
Where is a lover like me?  
Where is anyone as charming as you?  

The heart has made a mistake,  
The heart has made a mistake.  

The heart has made a mistake,  
Now tell me, what will happen to us?  

Tell me, what will happen to us?  
Tell me, what will happen to us?  

Tell me, oh beloved,  
What will happen to us?  

The heart has made a mistake,  
The heart has made a mistake.  

The heart has made a mistake...
