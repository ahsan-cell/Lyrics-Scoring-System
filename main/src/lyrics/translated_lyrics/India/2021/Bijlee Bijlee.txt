**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, moonlit girl,  
Oh, sister of the changing moon,  
Everyone calls you electric, electric,  
Under whom even the falling stars have no escape,  
The stars are scared to stay near.  

Oh, Cinderella!  
Oh, Cinderella, my heart has come for you,  
Dancing with my anklets on,  
With that dark kohl you wear,  
Ludhiana is left behind completely,  
Ludhiana is left behind completely.  

Your enchanting eyes, oh fair one,  
Oh, moonlit girl, sister of the changing moon,  
Everyone calls you electric, electric,  
Under whom even the falling stars have no escape,  
The stars are scared to stay near.  

Oh, Cinderella,  
You’ve caught the Jatt’s eye,  
In the heat, you’ve become cool,  
I’m your chocolate,  
You’ve become my sugar,  
I’ve become a wanderer,  
You’ve become a wanderer too,  
Your slanted gaze,  
Has made lovers intoxicated.  

Oh, for the weight of three flowers,  
I’ll wait for you,  
Even if you’re late,  
Your eyes make me feel enchanted,  
With that green attire you wear,  
With that green attire you wear,  
People want to take photos with you.  

Oh, moonlit girl, sister of the changing moon,  
Everyone calls you electric, electric,  
Under whom even the falling stars have no escape,  
The stars are scared to stay near.  

Oh, Cinderella, my heart has come for you,  
Dancing with my anklets on,  
With that dark kohl you wear,  
Ludhiana is left behind completely.  

What a wonder, what a marvel,  
What a commotion, what a stir,  
Kashmiri apples,  
Too much red!  
Oh, with the fairies,  
In the dance of the serpent,  
What else do you seek?  
If you know, it’s with you.  

Oh, someone writes about your tresses,  
Someone writes about your curls,  
Now everyone writes about you,  
They say flowers write about you,  
Great poets like Jaani,  
Are all around you,  
Oh, moonlit girl, sister of the changing moon,  
Everyone calls you electric, electric,  
Under whom even the falling stars have no escape,  
The stars are scared to stay near.  

Oh, Cinderella, my heart has come for you,  
Dancing with my anklets on,  
With that dark kohl you wear,  
Ludhiana is left behind completely.  
Oh, moonlit girl,  
Oh, moonlit girl.
