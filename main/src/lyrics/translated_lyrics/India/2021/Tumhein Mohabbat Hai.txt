**Translated Lyrics:**

On your lips, trembling softly,  
In your words, speaking gently,  
Unraveling in the night so deep.  

In warm breaths, blending slowly,  
Meeting you when we’re all alone.  

In dreams, he comes to love you,  
Every day, a hundred times, he dies for you.  
In dreams, he comes to love you,  
Every day, a hundred times, he dies for you.  

Pulling you close in his embrace,  
Playing with your earrings, a sweet chase.  

He claims his right over you,  
I want to ask you, it’s true.  
He claims his right over you,  
I want to ask you, it’s true.  

Who is he? What’s he like?  
Who is he? What’s he like, what does he look like?  
Who is he? What’s he like, what does he look like?  

I know that I’m not him,  
I’m not him, the one you love,  
The one you love.
