Eh eh  
Your eyes are in my eyes, what should I say?  
For the first time, this happens to me  
I think of you all the time  
Your love is deep in my heart  
And your words are like a blessing  
Your love is something I accept  
Come walk with me  

[Chorus: F1rstman]  
You are my, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
You are my, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  

[Verse 1: F1rstman]  
Shawty, can you give me some time?  
I keep you on my mind  
You tell me to slow it down, just watch me now  
You’ll give me love that feels so nice  
I can’t live without you, baby  
I’m not satisfied without you, baby  
Make me your husband, give me your babies  
Make me your husband, give me your babies  

[Bridge: F1rstman]  
You call to my heart, make it smile  
Your memories, they call to my heart  
You call to my heart, make it smile  
Your memories, they call to my heart  

[Pre-chorus: F1rstman & Dystinct]  
Your eyes are in my eyes, what should I say?  
For the first time, this happens to me  
I think of you all the time  
Your love is deep in my heart  
And your words are like a blessing  
Your love is something I accept  
Come walk with me  

[Chorus: F1rstman]  
You are my, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
You are my, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  

[Verse 2: Dystinct]  
Where were you, how long has it been?  
With you, my state has changed  
I felt a great love  
More and more, more and more  
No one but you  
I’d be sick without you  
No one but you  
I have no one else  

[Bridge: F1rstman]  
You call to my heart, make it smile  
Your memories, they call to my heart  
You call to my heart, make it smile  
Your memories, they call to my heart  

[Pre-chorus: F1rstman & Dystinct]  
Your eyes are in my eyes, what should I say?  
For the first time, this happens to me  
I think of you all the time  
Your love is deep in my heart  
And your words are like a blessing  
Your love is something I accept  
Come walk with me  

[Chorus: F1rstman]  
You are my, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
You are my, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved  
My, my, my beloved
