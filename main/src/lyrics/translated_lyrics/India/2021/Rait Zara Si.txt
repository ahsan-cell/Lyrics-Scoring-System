**Translated Lyrics:**

Finding you, to find you  
This is how I want to live  
In a moment, there are centuries  
In centuries...  
This is how I want to live  

In my hand is your fragrance, my heart is soothed by the scent  
It slips through my fingers, like a little bit of sand  
Every day, love reads, my heart connects with you  
It flies in the air, like a little bit of sand  

**Vācam, adu vācam vīzudadi**  
**Vācam, adu vācam vīzudadi**  

This commotion, this commotion of the heart  
Says today, you’re near me  
I’m scattered for a moment in the air  
Holding onto your trust  

I need to walk, I need to change  
In you, I need to blend  

The heart is a bit emotional, it fills up with words  
And then it overflows from my eyes, like a little bit of sand  
In my hand is your fragrance, if you ask me, it’s like this now  
You linger on my face, like a little bit of sand  

**Vācam, adu vācam vīzudadi**  
**Vācam, adu vācam vīzudadi**  

**Vācam vīzudadi**  
Oh, na-na-na  
(**Vācam vīzudadi**)  
(**Vācam vīzudadi**)
