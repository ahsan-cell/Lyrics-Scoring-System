**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Hey, are you there?  
Hold my heart, please  
Tell me why this distance?  
Stay in front of my eyes  
Without you,  
The world feels like poison  
How do I take someone else?  
Many have become enemies  

[Pre-Chorus]  
When I look into your eyes, everything ignites, you’re the fire  
Oh, just be mine, that’s all I desire  
When I look into your eyes, everything ignites, you’re the fire  
Oh, just be mine  

[Chorus]  
Baby, baby  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover  
The spark in your eyes  
I can’t, I can’t recover  
When I see you,  
I can’t, I can’t stay sober  
You have an effect on my heart and soul  

[Verse 2]  
When you’re near me,  
You don’t stay quiet at all  
Stars fall when your hair flows  
Where do you walk, girl, like water you flow  
If you’re not in my arms, it feels like a dream  

[Pre-Chorus]  
You walk like you’re under a spell, day and night  
Just a little trippy, but you know it’s alright  

[Chorus]  
Baby, baby  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover  
The spark in your eyes  
I can’t, I can’t recover  
When I see you,  
I can’t, I can’t stay sober  
You have an effect on my heart and soul  
Baby, baby  

[Verse 3]  
Let’s go, girl, where are we in this two-seater, just you and me?  
I’ll spend money like water  
What do you want, just say your name  
I’ll make the world yours  
Just stay mine  
We won’t sleep all night, truly  
Girl, just sit beside me  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Keep your secrets close, don’t let them show  
How many smiles can you hide, oh no  
Keep your secrets close, don’t let them show  
How many smiles can you hide, oh no  

[Chorus]  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover  
The spark in your eyes  
I can’t, I can’t recover  
When I see you,  
I can’t, I can’t stay sober  
You have an effect on my heart and soul  
Baby, baby  

[Outro]  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover  
Baby, baby  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover  
Baby, baby  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover  
Baby, baby  
You’re mine, I’m yours, my lover
