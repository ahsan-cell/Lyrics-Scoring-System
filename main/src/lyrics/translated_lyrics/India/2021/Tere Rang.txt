**Translated Lyrics:**

Gone, caught in a bind, not yielding,  
Tangled up, oh how did someone slip away?  
Embraced by the heart, an unknown feeling.  

That form and hue like the blue sky,  
Seemed like a complete meditation, love shattered,  
Every part of me awakened, my heart a drum,  
And my body a kite, together we soar,  
And oh, Krishna.  

Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha.  

This melody woven into every breath,  
This melody woven into every breath,  
Brings forth the signs of love, of song,  
Of enchantment's blessing.  

Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha.  

Oh, if you come by someday,  
Then don’t leave, don’t go away.  
If you must depart,  
Then come back, don’t stay away.  

Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze,  
Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze.  

Yes, if you come by someday,  
Then don’t leave, don’t go away.  
If you must depart,  
Then come back, don’t stay away.  

Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze,  
Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze.  

To find you within yourself,  
Body and soul, you (my heart),  
To know the heart through you,  
Entangled in confusion (lost in thought).  

To find you within yourself,  
Body and soul, you (my heart),  
Eyes secretly surrender,  
The heart is silent (lost in thought).  
May the thread not break, no, no, no,  
Bound by the gaze that ties us together,  
When I see you, I see all your colors (all your hues),  
May these colors not fade, may they never part.  

Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze,  
Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze.  

Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze,  
Your colors paint me, your colors paint me,  
My heart will bloom, my body will blaze.  

Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha.  

This melody woven into every breath,  
This melody woven into every breath,  
Brings forth the signs of love, of song,  
Of enchantment's blessing.  

Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha,  
Listen to this tune of the flute, Radha.
