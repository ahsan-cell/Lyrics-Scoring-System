**Translated Lyrics:**

Ho-e-ho-e, ho-e-ho-e  
My friend is my wealth, my friend is my ruin  
My love bears witness for both of us  
My friend is my fame, my friend is my disgrace  
My love bears witness for both of us  

Oh, in this one lifetime  
In this one lifetime, I've been given all seven joys  
Oh God, I would die after tasting the sweetness  

Oh, my diamond, may you live for ages  
With my beloved, take the rounds of love  
Oh, my diamond, may you live for ages  
With my beloved, take the rounds of love  

Ho-e-ho-e, ho-e-ho-e  
Ho-e-ho-e, ho-e-ho-e  

Your light is my pride  
I've become like you, oh-oh  
The neighborhood that belongs to you is now mine  
I've become part of your home  

Oh, in this one lifetime, both worlds have been given to me  
Oh God, I would die after tasting the sweetness  

Oh, my diamond, may you live for ages  
With my beloved, take the rounds of love  
Oh, my diamond, may you live for ages  
With my beloved, take the rounds of love  

Oh, may blessings rain upon you and light shine on your face  
May your bangles sparkle, and may misfortunes stay away from you  
Oh, may misfortunes stay away from you, oh, may misfortunes stay away from you
