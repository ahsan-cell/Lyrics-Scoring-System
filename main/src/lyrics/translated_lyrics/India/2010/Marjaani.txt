**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Ugo Borghetti]**  
I drink a nice cold one, swallow four Xanax  
Time stands still, a hit that guts you (Oh, what time is it?)  
Stuffed with drinks, dry (Come on, hey)  
Grab that bottle of prosecco, we’ll break the scale  
Add some baking soda to the spoon (Take two hits, oh)  
I died the day I was born (Yesterday), wrong dosage ([?])  
Throw in the pasta, dry, we’re not shooting (Bang)  
We eat, we drink, and we’ll serenade you (Then we’ll come back, hey)  

**[Verse 2: Franco126]**  
True rascals, Peroni squad (Squah)  
Food galore, wine non-stop, and I’m on top (Eh, eh, eh)  
Basically, I only care  
About eating, drinking, and filling my belly  
Who cares about the ordinance?  
I’ll binge until I drop, end up in an ambulance (Nino)  
Rolling with cash counted, I’m throwing up four times  
Changing all my traits  
I come home so wasted I can’t even remember my name  
I sleep dressed on the couch, beer still tight in hand  
Ah, yeah, I’m with the rascals and shouting in public  
We want Giovanni Peroni, saint right now (Ah-ah)  

**[Verse 3: Seany126]**  
If I piss, I paint (Eh), I disgust myself (Yeah)  
Pay me, artist (Yah), bring out the brew, friend (Oh)  
Forget Dom Pérignon, if I toast, I crush you  
You tie your ice to your dick  
On the street in January, it always gets warmer  
Forgive the curtain, I bow and the deck chair (Oh)  
Tables set up (Ah, ah, ah, ah), these tracks (Eh, yeah) recorded (Ah, ah, ah, ah)  
If I kept going, I’d send you to shreds (Yeah)  
One-two-six  

**[Chorus: Franco126]**  
(Ah-ah)  
I like blondes like Peroni (Ah-ah)  
I make a lot of bombs and drink Peroni (Ah-ah)  
Ordinance and you drink for a Peroni  
Screw craft beers, we drink Peroni (Ah-ah)  

**[Verse 4: Il Tre]**  
Rascal  
I drink like Paul Gascoigne  
Peroni for hours, you find me annoying  
At the club, they either throw me out or I don’t go out  
Mixing drinks with stimulants or narcotics  
Either you find us at the bar, or in stalls half a meter apart  
Heart racing, liquor, tequila  
Even the ugliest looks like Lila Tequila  
I avoid water, windshield wipers  
To me, you don’t dip crystals  
Posse track, sending down like it’s crack  
I pass the joint to your buddy, hear how he coughs (Ah-ah)  

**[Verse 5: ASP126]**  
1-2-6, picnic on Persian carpets  
Every night we spot the Martians (Uh, uh)  
You bet before checking the scores  
Every night we toast to Pantani (Pirate)  
I eat fried chicken and pastrami  
Your crew looks like castrated  
Buffet raided  
We’re at the bar like the elderly  
We smell like spices  
With stationary lifestyles  
The funding allocated  
Peroni until we’re full  
Peroni in the heads of jokers  
Thin eyes, Miyazaki  
Our thoughts are spaced out  
126, above all the parking lots (Yah) (Ah-ah)  

**[Verse 6: Ketama126]**  
I’ve been doing this shit since I was a kid (Kid)  
UBC, 126, Peroni P squad (P squad)  
I’ve never paid to make records  
Pay for drinks or you’ll get the whistles  
I told myself, it’s like saying ISIS (Uh)  
Tonight I’m dropping a Kandinsky  
Bang bang, sending these rappers to bed  
Looks like you have your little things (Go, go)  
I put this ball under the seven  
Sending this crap straight to SerT (Out)  
I like blondes like Peroni  
I make bombs and drink Peroni  
The only blonde I trust is Peroni  
No baby bottles, just Peroni  

**[Chorus: Franco126]**  
(Ah-ah)  
I like blondes like Peroni (Ah-ah)  
I make a lot of bombs and drink Peroni (Ah-ah)  
Ordinance and you drink for a Per
