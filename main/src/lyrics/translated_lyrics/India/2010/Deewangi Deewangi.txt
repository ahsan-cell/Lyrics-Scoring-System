**Translated Lyrics:**

Slowly, slowly, let a story unfold  
Look, look, the evening is quite enchanting  
Slowly, slowly, let a story unfold  

Beloved, captivating, charming sights abound  
Today, how many stars have come down to the ground  

Mind and senses are lost in this bliss  
We are here, with heart and soul, in this  
Just madness, madness, pure madness  

No thief, no guide,  
Who bears this blame?  
Oh, just madness, madness, pure madness  

All hot girls, put your hands up and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  
All cool boys, come on, make some noise and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  

The evening is a marvelous uproar  
Its intoxication is deep and intense  
The evening is a marvelous uproar  
Its intoxication is deep and intense  

Hair flowing like silk,  
Breath mingling softly,  
These are just signs  

Mind and senses are lost in this bliss  
We are here, with heart and soul, in this  
Just madness, madness, pure madness  

No thief, no guide,  
Who bears this blame?  
Oh, just madness, madness, pure madness  

All hot girls, put your hands up and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  
All cool boys, come on, make some noise and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  

All hot girls, put your hands up and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  
All cool boys, come on, make some noise and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  

Though everything seems peaceful to say,  
This heart still craves its wild way.  
Though everything seems peaceful to say,  
This heart still craves its wild way.  
For a moment or two, let dreams take flight,  
Let it reveal to all, the secrets of the night.  

Mind and senses are lost in this bliss  
We are here, with heart and soul, in this  
Just madness, madness, pure madness  

No thief, no guide,  
Who bears this blame?  
Oh, just madness, madness, pure madness  

All hot girls, put your hands up and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  
All cool boys, come on, make some noise and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  

All hot girls, put your hands up and say  
"Om Shanti Om"  
All cool boys, come on, make some noise and say  
"Om Shanti Om"
