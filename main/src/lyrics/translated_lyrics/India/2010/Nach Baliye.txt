**Translated Lyrics:**

Amrayal!  
(Ayooo)  
Hangover, hangover  

Girl, I can’t get enough of you, your eyes are a killer, my dear  
You shine like the light of the heavens, your fair skin steals my heart, darling  
I’m far away, you’re like a kite, always together in this life, oh please come back to me  
Going all out in Calgary, keeping my heart safe, I’ve got a villa on the hills for you, darling  

In your eyes, I’ve lost myself, your intoxication has taken over me  
I can’t sleep, I can’t find peace, it feels like a hangover  

Your beauty is stunning, your body’s so lean, a little cute and a little mean  
I’m a gym lover, and you’re my purple dream  

Your beauty is stunning, your body’s so lean, a little cute and a little mean  
I’m a gym lover, and you’re my purple dream  

With just a glance, we exchange signals  
Sofi makes the boys go wild  
There’s magic in those eyes  
Under the influence of your name  
How many have been enchanted?  
Girl, what’s your plan?  
Just tell me, do you have a man?  
Just tell me, do you have a man?  
Just tell me, do you have a man?  
They say, when will we meet?  
I’ll say it as fast as I can  
Amrayal!  

In your eyes, I’ve lost myself, your intoxication has taken over me  
I can’t sleep, I can’t find peace, it feels like a hangover  

My heart is hungover  
I haven’t slept for many nights  
Sleep doesn’t come, the moon keeps shining  
Your beauty has me spellbound!  

Oh darling, my heart is hungover  
I haven’t slept for many nights  
Sleep doesn’t come, the moon keeps shining  
Your beauty has me spellbound!  

Girl, I can’t get enough of you, your eyes are a killer, my dear  
You shine like the light of the heavens, your fair skin steals my heart, darling  
I’m far away, you’re like a kite, always together in this life, oh please come back to me  
Going all out in Calgary, keeping my heart safe, I’ve got a villa on the hills for you, darling  

In your eyes, I’ve lost myself, your intoxication has taken over me  
I can’t sleep, I can’t find peace, it feels like a hangover  
In your eyes, I’ve lost myself,  
Your intoxication has taken over me  
I can’t sleep, I can’t find peace, it feels like a hangover.
