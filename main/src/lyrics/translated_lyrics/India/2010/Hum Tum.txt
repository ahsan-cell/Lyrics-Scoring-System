**Translated Lyrics:**

Heeeeeee  
Haaaaaaaa  

*Piano instrumental (10 sec)*  

**Intro (Babul)**  
Let your breath blend with mine for a while  

**Intro (Alika)**  
Hmmm hmmm hmmm la la la la  

**Chorus (Babul)**  
Let your breath blend with mine for a while  
Let the soft heartbeat rise a little  
It's a request of the moments, come close to me  
We, we are you  
You, we are you  

**Verse (Alka)**  
Let me sink into your eyes for a moment  
Let me melt in your arms for a while  

**Chorus (Alka)**  
It's a request of the moments, come close to me  
We, we are you  
You, we are you  
**(Babul)**  
Let your breath blend with mine for a while?  

**Verse (Babul)**  
Somewhere there are greetings, somewhere there are turns  
Even the kohl might spread out  

**Verse (Alka)**  
In the gaze, passing by  
A caravan of dreams  

**Verse (Babul)**  
Let the bodies and souls burn for a while  
Let shyness and modesty stir for a moment  

**Verse (Alka)**  
Oh, it's a request of the moments, come close to me  

**Chorus (Both)**  
We, we are you  
You, we are you  

**Chorus (Babul)**  
Let your breath blend with mine for a while  

**Verse (Alka)**  
Touch my body, but in this way  
Like a melodious instrument?  

**Verse (Babul)**  
In the darkness hidden in your hair  
Open up, let the night be free  

**Verse (Alka)**  
Let the veil flow from your chest for a while  
Let the dewdrops trickle down for a moment  

**Chorus (Babul)**  
It's a request of the moments, come close to me  
**Chorus (Both)**  
We, we are you  
You, we are you  

**Chorus (Babul)**  
Let your breath blend with mine for a while  
**Chorus (Alka)**  
Let me melt in your arms for a while  
**Chorus (Babul)**  
It's a request of the moments, come close to me  
**Chorus (Together)**  
We, we are you  
You, we are you  

*Violin instrumental (12 secs)*  

**Chorus (Alka)**  
We, we are you  
You, we are you
