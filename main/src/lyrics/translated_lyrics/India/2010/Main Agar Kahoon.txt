**Translated Lyrics:**

I have found you, yet it feels like I've lost myself,  
Even if I want to say something, what can I tell you?

**[Pre-Chorus: Sonu Nigam]**  
I have found you, yet it feels like I've lost myself,  
Even if I want to say something, what can I tell you?  
There aren't even words in any language  
To express what you are, to let you know.

**[Chorus: Sonu Nigam]**  
If I say, "There’s no beauty like you  
Anywhere in the universe,"  
This praise is also true, yet it means nothing,  
I have found you, yet it feels like I've lost myself.

**[Instrumental-break]**

**[Verse 1: Sonu Nigam]**  
These playful gestures, drenched in charm,  
Glimmering from your face, they shine.  
The thick clouds of your hair cascade with grace,  
Your flowing veil sways like a cloud,  
Filled in my arms like moonlight, the radiance of beauty.

**[Chorus: Sonu Nigam]**  
If I say, "This allure  
Is nowhere else, nor will it ever be,"  
This praise is also true, yet it means nothing,  
I have found you, yet it feels like I've lost myself.

**[Instrumental-break]**

**[Verse 2: Shreya Ghoshal]**  
When you are kind, this is our tale,  
Oh, when you are kind, this is our tale.  
Now, you and I are one caravan,  
Where you are, I am there.

**[Chorus: Sonu Nigam]**  
If I say, "My companion,  
You are either a celestial nymph or a fairy,"  
This praise is also true, yet it means nothing.

**[Pre-Chorus: Sonu Nigam]**  
I have found you, yet it feels like I've lost myself,  
Even if I want to say something, what can I tell you?  
There aren't even words in any language  
To express what you are, to let you know.

**[Chorus: Sonu Nigam]**  
If I say, "There’s no beauty like you  
Anywhere in the universe,"  
This praise is also true, yet it means nothing.
