**Translated Lyrics:**

Talk flashy, your name's Kodak  
I want to lose, whoa, didn't know that  
If rap were a cake, I’d be so fat  

Sometimes Jet Li, sometimes Brett Lee  
Moving so fast, they’ll never catch fire  
Your bad dream you’ve never seen  
Just like that, you could never forget me  

The paths were close, special for you, but they were sad  
And when life started bringing me accidents  
Love began to slip from my hands  
Taking me through winter fell, the last wish, a coin in the well  

I died before they knew  
I’ll be back from the dead just like Jon Snow  

Who is Void?  
Is he the king of rapping? (No)  
Is he a pawn in chess? (No)  
Are secrets hidden in the Pentagon? (Right)  

Who is Void, an icon, when the mic’s on it’s a cyclone  
By God, you’re a python, right or wrong, what’s the fight on?  
You burn like nylon, get out  

I have to lose you with such intensity, how can I?  
How can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?  

Gotta battle, come on, the game’s on  
Mission 007, James Bond  
Who’s the chief of this game, what should I say?  
I have beef with myself (Beef)  

My songs aren’t viral, theirs are vinyl  
It’s getting spinal, now it plays violin in the finals  
What about the rest?  
On silent  

It’s hard for you, easy for me  
Not love, yet it feels like a mark  
The shop of hip-hop, the voice of truth  
In the rap game, it’s cold, rappers catch a cold  

Hey dancer, don’t go rapping  
DIVINE, you danced for Raftaar  
But you don’t know we’re the Khwaja of words  
Rap is morphine for me, I feel pain way too often  
Going shopping alone  
I put rappers into their coffin  

My flow is the best, they copy and paste  
Still, their taste is bland, don’t waste a moment  
Now hurry up and get out  
Get out  

I said, I said, I said get out  
Leave at the first chance  

Don’t worry about pride  
Void is mentioned  
Now liquor isn’t filling my nose  
Skin’s getting thicker, not bulletproof  

Betray me but don’t be foolish  
Let me show you the truth here  
This isn’t a real blueprint, no photo taken  
Hearts aren’t toys, there was a begum nearby  

Didn’t rob a bank, yet there’s a storm  
I’m kryptonite to rappers  
Fist tight, still how to fight this?  
You’ll do it, quickly move aside  
He won’t diss you, he’s too polite  
Aiming for the target, yes, you’re clever  
Change your side, Shakuni Mama  
Yesterday I was calm like a llama  

Today in the crowd, like Bhishma Pitamah  

With such intensity, how can I lose you?  
How can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?  

How can I lose you, how can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?  

With such intensity, how can I lose you?  
How can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?  

How can I lose you, how can I?  
How can I lose you, how can I?
