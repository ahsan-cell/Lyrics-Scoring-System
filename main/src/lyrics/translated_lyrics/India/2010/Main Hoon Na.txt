**Translated Lyrics:**

Whose wait is this for you? I'm here, right?
Just take a look over here once, I'm here, right?
Whose wait is this for you? I'm here, right?
Just take a look over here once, I'm here, right?

Why are you silent? Whatever you want to say, say it
As much as your heart desires, ask for that much love
Oh, you will receive as much love, I'm here, right?

[Chorus]
Whose wait is this for you? I'm here, right?
Just take a look over here once, I'm here, right?

[Verse 1]
Sometimes when you think, that you see this
Oh, how much I love you
So donâ€™t stay quiet, tell me this
Oh, is there really such a friend?

[Verse 2]
If someone gives not just their heart, but their life to you
If someone gives not just their heart, but their life to you
Oh, then I would say, my dear, I'm here, right?

Whose wait is this for you? I'm here, right?
Just take a look over here once, I'm here, right?

Whose wait is this for you? I'm here, right?
Just take a look over here once, I'm here, right?

If there's a desire or a wish
If there's a desire or a wish
Oh, never be restless, I'm here, right?
