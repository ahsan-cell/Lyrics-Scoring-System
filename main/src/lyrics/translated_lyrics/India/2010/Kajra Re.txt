**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
With such a gaze, that cruel one looked at me in the square,  
I placed my heart on the edge of a knife.  
A commotion broke out!  
The chaos spread!

[Verse 1]  
My peace and comfort are all shattered,  
Oh cruel one, look away!  
My peace and comfort are all shattered,  
Oh cruel one, look away!  

We are being ruined, oh dear,  
We are being ruined, oh dear, your own townsfolk.  
My peace and comfort are all shattered,  
Oh cruel one, look away!  
We are being ruined, oh dear, your own townsfolk.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, may my stretch not break, come to me,  
May my stretch not break, come to me.

[Chorus]  
Kajal, oh!  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh my eyes, my eyes, my twin eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes.

[Verse 2]  
Your promises are written in kohl,  
They come alive through the language of your eyes.  
Your lips leave marks on my handkerchiefs,  
Tying them as a sign, they depart.

Oh, your words carry the fragrance of perfume,  
Oh, your arrival feels like the summer breeze.  
Oh, your words carry the fragrance of perfume,  
Oh, your arrival feels like the summer breeze.  
Come, let not the stretch break.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, may my stretch not break, come to me,  
May my stretch not break, come to me.

[Chorus]  
Kajal, oh!  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh my eyes, my eyes, my eyes are entranced by you,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes.

[Verse 3]  
Eyes work wonders,  
They ask personal questions.  
I don’t even lift my eyelids,  
But I keep the curtain in mind.  
Oh, my sorrow doesn’t hide from anyone,  
It hurts when it doesn’t prick.  
Oh, my sorrow doesn’t hide from anyone,  
It hurts when it doesn’t prick.  
Come, let not the stretch break.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, may my stretch not break, come to me,  
May my stretch not break, come to me.

[Chorus]  
Kajal, oh!  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh my eyes, my eyes, they are captivated by you,  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes.

[Verse 4]  
Oh, meeting you in Old Delhi,  
We left behind a mark in Delhi.  
Moments spent without purpose,  
Your and my story in Delhi.

Those with the beautiful buds remember,  
Swearing by your dark, dark eyes.  
Your dark, dark eyes have created my soul,  
Your dark eyes have blessed my soul.  
Sad are the lips, there is thirst,  
Come, oh come, oh come.  
Oh, your words carry the fragrance of perfume,  
Oh, your arrival feels like the summer breeze.  
Oh, your words carry the fragrance of perfume,  
Oh, your arrival feels like the summer breeze.

[Pre-Chorus]  
Oh, may my stretch not break, come to me,  
May my stretch not break, come to me.

[Chorus]  
Kajal, oh!  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Oh, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes are twins,  
Oh, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes are twin eyes.

Oh, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes stay quiet,  
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes stay quiet.  
Oh kajal, oh, kajal, your dark, dark eyes,  
Kajal, oh
