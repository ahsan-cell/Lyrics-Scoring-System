**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Elvana Gjata]  
Uh-uh, baby  
Uh-uh, baby  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  
Uh-uh, baby  
Uh-uh, baby  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  

[Verse 1: MC Kresha]  
She said she loves it  
She told me before, when I saw her outside the club  
Waiting for me, they wouldn’t let me in out of spite  
Telling herself: "Damn it!"  
My heart aches when I see you drinking high  
If you were mine, we’d go twice a month to the honey  
Far away from noise, dust, and asphalt  
Far away from work, numbers, and contacts  
But the word, I’ll give you my imagination  

[Chorus: Elvana Gjata]  
I want to go out with you, but you’re not here  
I can’t forgive you because you just leave me  
Baby, it’s not fair  
Baby, it’s not fair  
I’m missing you and I can’t hide it  
I don’t have any words that I can express to you  
Baby, it’s not fair  
Baby, it’s not fair  

[Post-Chorus: Elvana Gjata]  
Uh-uh, baby  
Uh-uh, baby  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  
Uh-uh, baby  
Uh-uh, baby  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  
Hey, hey, hey, eh-eh  

[Verse 2: MC Kresha]  
In my thoughts all night, I took my jacket with me  
So cold, I could’ve gone into the club at least  
To find that girl who resembles Elvana Gjata  
Uh, she walks by, stunning like in a theater  
Dance to the rhythm, bounce, bounce the sound system  
You’re too gangsta to be on the rhythm  
I said, dance to the rhythm, bounce the sound system  
You’re too gangsta to be on the rhythm  

[Chorus: Elvana Gjata]  
I want to go out with you, but you’re not here  
I can’t forgive you because you just leave me  
Baby, it’s not fair  
Baby, it’s not fair  
I’m missing you and I can’t hide it  
I don’t have any words that I can express to you  
Baby, it’s not fair  
Baby, it’s not fair  

[Verse 3: Elvana Gjata]  
Boy-y-y-y (Uh)  
Boy, they point at you  
I’m here for you and I don’t take it seriously  
No, no, it’s not happening by chance  
You’re here for me and the others are a mistake  
They wait for you, and while waiting, they remain  
As long as we enjoy ourselves and wait for the morning together  
We fit together, we have each other  
Sky is the limit when we’re both together  

[Chorus: Elvana Gjata]  
I want to go out with you, but you’re not here  
I can’t forgive you because you just leave me  
Baby, it’s not fair  
Baby, it’s not fair  
I’m missing you and I can’t hide it  
I don’t have any words that I can express to you  
Baby, it’s not fair  
Baby, it’s not fair
