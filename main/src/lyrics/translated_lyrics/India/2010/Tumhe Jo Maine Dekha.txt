**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Abhijeet]  
You are here, and so am I, come closer and I'll tell you,  
Why did I suddenly become a madman in this moment?

[Chorus: Abhijeet]  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
All my senses have vanished,  
This fragrance of your body has begun to awaken magic,  
And in this state of losing control, my heart has gone astray.

[Chorus: Abhijeet]  
When I thought of you, when I believed in you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
All my senses have vanished.

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1: Abhijeet]  
Why are you so beautiful?  
That everyone is amazed, does such a girl truly exist in the world?  
More lovely than any fairy.

Yes, why do you speak so beautifully?  
Those who see you are left speechless; look, I too am lost,  
Dazed, this madness has enveloped me.

[Chorus: Abhijeet]  
You are the one I worship, you are the one I long for,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
All my senses have vanished,  
This fragrance of your body has begun to awaken magic,  
And in this state of losing control, my heart has gone astray.

[Chorus: Abhijeet]  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
All my senses have vanished.

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Shreya Ghoshal]  
You are here, and so am I, come closer and I'll tell you,  
What you saw, who knows what has happened?

I don’t know why I feel so lost, neither awake nor asleep,  
Now there are desires in my heart, storms in my breath,  
In my eyes, there’s the moonlight of dreams.

[Pre-Chorus: Shreya Ghoshal]  
Yes, I don’t know why this mind is so dazed,  
This body is fragrant,  
You walk with grace, swaying, shyly,  
Like a melody that dances.

[Chorus: Shreya Ghoshal & Abhijeet]  
When I understood you, when I recognized you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
All my senses have vanished,  
This fragrance of your body has begun to awaken magic,  
And in this state of losing control, my heart has gone astray.

[Outro: Shreya Ghoshal & Abhijeet]  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you,  
When I saw you, when I got to know you.
