**Translated Lyrics:**

I see the stars shining  
Baby, here you shout  
Your love has made me so choosy  
Cool!

The whole world, the whole world has blossomed  
Now love is scattered in the air  
The whole world, the whole world has blossomed  
Now love is scattered in the air  
Now

The whole world, the whole world has blossomed  
Now love is scattered in the air  
The whole world, the whole world has blossomed  
Now love is scattered in the air  
Your heart touches the skies  
Look how it soars to the peaks

Now it's all about joy, morning and evening  
Now it's all about joy, in your love  
Now it's all about joy, rock the party  
Now it's all about joy

Joy, morning and evening  
Now it's all about joy, in your love  
Now it's all about joy, rock the party  
Now it's all about joy

Oh my love, you're like a sweet drink  
Oh my love, I want to savor you completely  
Oh my love, my heart wants to express  
My heart wants to express and live freely

Oh my love, you're like a sweet drink  
Oh my love, I want to savor you completely  
Oh my love, my heart wants to express  
My heart wants to express and live freely

With your sweet laughter, oh my love, I'm close  
Oh my love, I've become enchanted  
My heart has turned colorful  
My heart is with you, wherever it goes

Now it's all about joy, with your support  
Now it's all about joy, in celebration  
Now it's all about joy, join the party  
Now it's all about joy

Joy, morning and evening  
Now it's all about joy, in your love  
Now it's all about joy, rock the party  
Now it's all about joy

Oh my love, you're like gold  
Oh my love, I want to cherish you  
Oh my love, my heart wants to express  
My heart wants to express and gaze lovingly

Sitting close, oh my love, decorating your bed  
Oh my love, let’s talk together  
Every moment becomes  
My heart is restless, it’s gone wild

Now the whole world, the whole world has blossomed  
Now love is scattered in the air  
The whole world, the whole world has blossomed  
Now love is scattered in the air  
Your heart touches the skies  
Look how it soars to the peaks

Now it's all about joy, having found love  
Now it's all about joy, all together  
Now it's all about joy, everybody now  
It's all about joy

Now it's all about joy, having found love  
Now it's all about joy, all together  
Now it's all about joy, everybody now  
It's all about joy
