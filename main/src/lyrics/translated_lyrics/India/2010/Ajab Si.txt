**Translated Lyrics:**

Rolling out with grandpa's ancient red Žiguli  
It saw the light long ago, but on the gravel road, it rolls like a limousine  
This ride is dangerous, but luckily I remember all the tricks and all the quirks  
I take the girls for a spin through the villages, between the fields just as I promised  

[Chorus]  
The cabin is filled with smoke, and today it drives like KITT  
You can hear the tires squeal, racing like Mikk Sikk  
Stones fly up like hockey pucks  
Dust clouds visible for several kilometers  
Ahah Ahah  
Up and down the hills, we have plenty of girls in the car, the bottom can take it  
Ahah Ahah  
But I feel good because through a small crack in the window, the wind messes up my hair  

[Interlude]  
Who's here, who's there, who's below, who's above, ahah, ahah, I'm lucky tonight  
Who's here, who's there, who's below, who's above, ahah, ahah, I'm lucky tonight  

[Verse 2]  
With a wave of magic, hocus pocus, the car gathers speed  
All other plans have completely slipped my mind  
The pattern on the backrest is knitted by grandma  
We buy munchies, there's a sale at Rimi  
Two for the price of one, what a bonus  
In the woods, a campfire, enjoying nature, this lifestyle was made for me  
But other factors interrupt  
Parents are angry, eyes in the back of their heads  
Mom got mad when I left last time  
Fuel is expensive, and the car drinks a lot  
And like most, we're not rich  
But when there's a chance, we'll find a way  
This Žiguli will still get us there  

[Interlude]  
Who's here, who's there, who's below, who's above, ahah, ahah, I'm lucky tonight  
Who's here, who's there, who's below, who's above, ahah, ahah, I'm lucky tonight  

[Chorus]  
The cabin is filled with smoke, and today it drives like KITT  
You can hear the tires squeal, racing like Mikk Sikk  
Stones fly up like hockey pucks  
Dust clouds visible for several kilometers  
Ahah Ahah
