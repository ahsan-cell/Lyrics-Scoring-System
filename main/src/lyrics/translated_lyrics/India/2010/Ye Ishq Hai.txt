**Translated Lyrics:**

It happened with us,  
Love has bloomed,  
With you,  
We’ve made foolish mistakes,  
The heart doesn’t understand,  
What can we say about this?

In the stars, you are the shining one,  
A beautiful sight to behold,  
For the infidels, a refuge,  
The river finds its shore.  
In my sorrowful tale,  
You are the treasure of joy,  
Let us drown in your love,  
Now give us support.

Why such indifference?  
Just a little,  
Give me some peace.  
Mistakes have been made,  
It happened with us,  
Love has bloomed,  
With you.

In your eyes, I see God, my love,  
In your tones,  
There’s simplicity.  
I’ve fallen for you,  
Why should we tell anyone?  
These words are all  
A secret.  
In my thoughts, only your words linger,  
Where do the nights go?  
I’m used to your memories,  
My breaths call out your name.  
When I sit down to write about you,  
I end up leaving it blank.  
After a long wait,  
The rains have finally come.

What sacrifices can we make?  
Without you,  
We are devoted.  
Mistakes have been made,  
It happened with us,  
Love has bloomed,  
With you.
