**Translated Lyrics:**

(Bragging to all her friends, saying you're) I don't know why? (So unique) Yeah (Hmm)  
Yeah (So when you gonna—)

[Verse 1]  
When I sat down to write, what I felt came alive  
On blank pages, I question, what is my existence?  
I know one day I'll be famous,  
But for now, I'm miles away from my dreams, yeah.  
Dad thinks his son should become something,  
To stand on his own two feet, to walk by himself.  
He invested his life in making me who I am,  
Maybe one day I can make him happy.  
I was seventeen when I left home,  
Haven't returned in four years, my heart is full.  
Forgive me, Dad, maybe I haven't become as capable as you.  
Since childhood, death has loomed over me,  
Well, mental illness runs in our blood.  
We too want to live peacefully, leaving shame behind,  
It's my fault, this cruel world is unfaithful.  
I searched among hypocrites for loyalty, —you?

[Chorus: GAUSH & Olivia Rodrigo]  
I don't know why? Do you get déjà vu? Ah, Yeah  
I don't know why? Do you get déjà v—

[Verse 2]  
I buried his memories since he’s been gone,  
Lost faith in love, well, that’s okay too.  
I won’t be able to love openly if someone comes along, yeah.  
Just a giver in a world full of takers,  
Hard not to burst into rage seeing personal hatred.  
They don’t know anything, only God knows, brother.  
I kept moving, didn’t stop even when my knees were scraped.  
Why should I fight with strangers? Let me tell you the truth:  
What goes around comes around like hula hoops.  
If you could choose today to end your life,  
Would you choose to disappear or would you stay living right?  
I don’t know.  
I’d curse myself if I didn’t make something fighting against life.  
Life is amazing,  
Even though fate is in our hands, we still leave it to chance, —you?

[Chorus: GAUSH & Olivia Rodrigo]  
I don't know why? Do you get déjà vu? Ah, Yeah  
I don't know why? Do you get déjà vu, huh? —you?  
I don't know why? Do you get déjà vu? Ah, Yeah  
I don't know why? Do you get déjà vu, huh?
