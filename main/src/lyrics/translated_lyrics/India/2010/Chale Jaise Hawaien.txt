**Translated Lyrics:**

Flowing like the breezes, soft and light,  
Flying like the birds, soaring in flight,  
Fluttering like butterflies, through gardens bright,  
In this way, I wander, lost in delight.  

[Chorus]  
I’m a dreamer, the queen of my heart, unaware of sorrow,  
I fear nothing, I do what I’ve set my mind to follow.  
Flowing like the breezes, soft and light,  
Flying like the birds, soaring in flight.  

[Instrumental-break]  

[Verse]  
If someone stops me, if someone comes near,  
No matter how much they try to make it clear,  
I won’t listen, I’ll stay true to my song,  
I’m a little crazy, stubborn all along,  
Everyone says that’s just who I am.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
No one knows my desires, what dreams I hold dear.  

[Chorus]  
Flowing like the breezes, soft and light,  
Flying like the birds, soaring in flight,  
Fluttering like butterflies, through gardens bright,  
In this way, I wander, lost in delight.  

[Chorus]  
I’m a dreamer, a stranger, free from despair,  
I’m a wanderer, yet lovely, everyone’s aware.  
Flowing like the breezes, soft and light,  
Flying like the birds, soaring in flight,  
Fluttering like bumblebees, through gardens bright,  
In this way, I wander, lost in delight.  

Flowing like the breezes, soft and light,  
Flying like the birds, soaring in flight.
