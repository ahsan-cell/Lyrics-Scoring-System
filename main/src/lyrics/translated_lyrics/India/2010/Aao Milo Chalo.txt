**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1**  
As we start to walk,  
These paths begin to unfold,  
Yeah, yeah,  
They seem better than the destination we hold.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Come, let’s get lost together,  
Let’s disappear into the night,  
Come, let’s meet and walk,  
Where we’re going, we can’t quite sight.  

**Chorus**  
As we start to walk,  
These paths begin to unfold,  
Yeah, yeah,  
They seem better than the destination we hold.  

**Verse 2**  
How can one just sit still?  
When a new path is calling,  
You walk with me, I’ll walk too,  
Only then will distances be falling.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Come, let’s not be bound by anyone,  
Come, let’s meet and walk,  
Where we’re going, we can’t quite spot.  

**Chorus**  
As we start to walk,  
These paths begin to unfold,  
Yeah, yeah,  
They seem better than the destination we hold.  

**Verse 3**  
Eyes wide open, dreams start to speak,  
How did I wake from this bliss?  
Look around, where are we now?  
This bliss is taking us amiss.  

**Pre-Chorus**  
Come, let’s find a way where there’s no path,  
Come, let’s meet and walk,  
Where we’re going, we can’t quite grasp.  

**Chorus**  
As we start to walk,  
These paths begin to unfold,  
Yeah, yeah,  
They seem better than the destination we hold.
