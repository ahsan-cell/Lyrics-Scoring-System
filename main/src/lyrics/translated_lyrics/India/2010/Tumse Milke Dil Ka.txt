**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Love is like a storm, love is a tempest,  
In the face of love, every person is helpless.  
In love, everyone is crazy, in love, everyone is bewildered,  
In love, everything is difficult, in love, everything is easy.  
Look, dear, at these sights, these lovers, how lost they are in love.

[Chorus]  
Oh, what can I say about the state of my heart after meeting you?  
What a miracle this has become, what can I say?  
Oh, what can I say about the state of my heart after meeting you?  
What a miracle this has become, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus]  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, duma,  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara,  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, duma,  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, doom.

[Instrumental Break]

Check that, like that.

[Verse 1]  
The heart is a wanderer, my love, you are its destination,  
The heart is a boat, my love, and you are its shore.  
The heart asks for nothing, my love, if you are its gain,  
The heart is lonely, my love, come, you are the gathering.

[Verse 2]  
All happiness comes from love, love is also destruction,  
Love is a restriction, but love is also freedom.  
In the world of love, friends, there’s a population of dreams,  
Lost is the one whose destination love has revealed.  
Look, dear, at these sights, these lovers, how lost they are in love.

[Chorus]  
Oh, what can I say about the state of my heart after meeting you?  
What a miracle this has become, what can I say?  
Oh, what can I say about the state of my heart after meeting you?  
What a miracle this has become, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus]  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, duma,  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, doom.

[Instrumental Break]

Check that, like that.

[Verse 3]  
I worship you, I have devoted myself to you,  
When I loved, I loved like this.  
When I loved, I loved like this.  
Check that, wicked.

[Verse 4]  
My heart is crazy, my love, soothe it,  
Why is there turmoil in my heart, my love, explain it to me.  
The scent of your veil, my love, let it flutter,  
The curls like clouds, my love, shower them upon me.

Check that, like that.

[Verse 5]  
My love, this madman has brought his life for you,  
My love, he will perish for you, this moth.  
My love, you don’t know what’s in my heart,  
My love, you will remember this tale of mine.  
Look, dear, at these sights, these lovers, how lost they are in love.

[Chorus]  
Oh, what can I say about the state of my heart after meeting you?  
What a miracle this has become, what can I say?  
Oh, what can I say about the state of my heart after meeting you?  
What a miracle this has become, what can I say?

[Post-Chorus]  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, duma,  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, doom.  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, duma,  
Dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, dum tara, doom.
