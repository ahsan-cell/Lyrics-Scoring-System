**Translated Lyrics:**

Girl, I like your lively youth  
Darling, I like your enchanting eyes  
Fair one, I like your Armani shades  
Beloved, I like your dark, flowing hair  

[Aryan Sant]  
[Verse 1]  
You seem like a parrot to me,  
Your beauty is gold, but your heart is hollow.  
Your dad's a DCP, and he’s got plenty of cash,  
My name is known too; I'm not just some small fry.  
When you walk, your long hair sways,  
I turn around just to catch a glimpse of you.  
Your earrings never leave your ears,  
In blue jeans and black, you look just right.  
Your height is 5'8", and your weight is perfect,  
Every day you change your style for a date.  
I think you're hot; your look is top-notch,  
Just seeing you leaves me in shock.  
Like the music of DLA, it rocks,  
Come once, let’s make this work,  
My heart's queen, I want you, your king.  
Come to me and stay in my life.  

[Hook]  
Girl, I like your lively youth  
Darling, I like your enchanting eyes  
Fair one, I like your Armani shades  
Beloved, I like your dark, flowing hair  

[Verse 2]  
Oh Punjabi girl, you look so hot,  
You say yes like Angelina Jolie in a flop.  
Baby, I like you in Patiala salwar,  
In that kurti, your figure is amazing.  
Your eyes are dark, and your cheeks are fair,  
Baby, I like the net of your hair.  
Stop playing these games, don’t tease me,  
Let’s play hide and seek together.  
Your face is fair, and you wear black shades,  
Your long hair, and I like your face.  
Your charming ways are golden, and your walk is smooth,  
Baby, I like your amazing figure.  
Hold my hand; I’ll take you on a world tour,  
Hold my hand; I’ll take you for a long drive.  
Hold my hand; I’ll come into your life,  
Hold my hand; I’ll awaken your destiny.  
Come...  

[Hook]  
Girl, I like your lively youth  
Darling, I like your enchanting eyes  
Fair one, I like your Armani shades  
Beloved, I like your dark, flowing hair  
Dark, flowing hair...
