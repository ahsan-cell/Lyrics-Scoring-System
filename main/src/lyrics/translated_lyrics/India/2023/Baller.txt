**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
In the talks, my name's like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending, holding on to the end.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  
In the talks, my name's like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending, holding on to the end.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  

[Verse 1]  
The city’s breeze is now in our favor,  
Today it’s ours, who knows about tomorrow’s flavor?  
If yesterday changed, it’s no big deal,  
Life keeps spinning, that’s just how we feel.  
Moving fast, keeping up the speed,  
Playing our songs on repeat, that’s what we need.  
Heat leaves a mark on the body, can’t you see?  
Heads nodding along, looking sharp and free.  
Those who get caught, they’re left behind,  
Eyes signal the way, like stars aligned.  
This year brings more hits, that’s the plan,  
God bless us, we don’t depend on any man.  

[Chorus]  
In the talks, my name's like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending, holding on to the end.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  

[Verse 2]  
This world is all about rising friends,  
Don’t let doubts hold you back, just make amends.  
I said, stop playing games, let’s be real,  
Keep it cool, let the true vibe reveal.  
Polite words flow, but we ride with pride,  
Work hard, reach the peak, that’s our guide.  
Without any fuss, if someone leaks,  
We fix it our way, that’s how we speak.  
With open hearts, we take on the day,  
No one can stop us, we’ll find our way.  
In bright days, we shine like the moon,  
With our crew, there’s no dead end too soon.  

[Chorus]  
In the talks, my name's like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending, holding on to the end.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.  
In the talks, my name's like a trend,  
Enemies keep bending, holding on to the end.  
No one dares to mess with this guy,  
From the start, I’ve been the one to defy.
