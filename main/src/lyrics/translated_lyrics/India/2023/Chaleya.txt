**Translated Lyrics:**

In love, the heart is made,  
In love, the heart is lost.  
Whether to erase or to create,  
I have chosen you.

[Verse 1]  
Wearing all your colors, adopting your style,  
I’ve become yours, leaving everyone behind.  
Love isn’t something to measure, to reveal secrets,  
I’ve come to speak out loud.

[Chorus]  
Oh, I’m moving towards you, your pull is strong,  
I’ve become yours, my friend, I’ve forgotten the world.  
Moving towards you, your pull is strong,  
I’ve become yours, my friend, I’ve forgotten the world.

[Post-Chorus]  
I left the world for you, my heart is joined with yours,  
Now I’ve become yours, in finding you, I got lost.  
I left the world for you, I left it behind,  
My heart is joined with yours, joined together.  
Now I’ve become yours, I’ve become yours,  
In finding you, I got lost, got lost, yes.

[Interlude]  
In love, the heart is made,  
In love, the heart is lost, ohh, oh.  
Make me laugh or make me cry,  
I have chosen you, ohh, oh.

[Verse 2]  
The world says love is foolish, pointless,  
But we accept it wholeheartedly.  
In you, I see the light of God, a blissful intoxication,  
You are mine, and that’s my pride.

[Chorus]  
Oh, I’m moving towards you, your pull is strong,  
I’ve become yours, my friend, I’ve forgotten the world.  
Moving towards you, your pull is strong,  
I’ve become yours, my friend, I’ve forgotten the world.

[Verse 3]  
You are like a dream of love, immeasurable to me,  
I want to kiss your words, like an Urdu book.  
A dream of love, immeasurable to me,  
I want to kiss your words, like an Urdu book.

[Outro]  
I left the world for you, in love, the heart is made,  
My heart is joined with yours, in love, the heart is lost.  
Now I’ve become yours, in finding you, I got lost.  
I left the world for you, whether to erase or to create,  
My heart is joined with yours, I have chosen you.  
Now I’ve become yours, in finding you, I got lost, got lost, yes.
