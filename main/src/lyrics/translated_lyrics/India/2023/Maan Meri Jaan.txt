**Translated Lyrics:**

I can never see sadness in your eyes  
I will keep you happy, my love  
I can never see silence on your lips  
I will listen to everything you say, my love  
I will never play with your heart  
I will give you all my secrets  
My dear, you’ve made me crazy  
I can't breathe without you  

[Chorus]  
Believe me, my love  
I won’t let you go  
I will keep you hidden in my arms  
Believe me, my love  
I won’t let you go  
I will keep you safe in my eyes  
Believe me, my love  
Believe me, my love  
Believe me, my love  

[Verse 2]  
I will be your shadow, staying with you 24 hours  
I will stay 24 hours  
(Without you, my heart feels empty)  
I will steal away your sorrows with my eyes  
Oh, whatever sorrows you have  
(Without you, my heart feels empty)  
Don’t leave when you come into my arms  
I pray to God for this  
I will never play with your heart  
I will give you all my secrets  
My dear, you’ve made me crazy  
I can't breathe without you  

[Chorus]  
Believe me, my love  
I won’t let you go  
I will keep you hidden in my arms  
Believe me, my love  
I won’t let you go  
I will keep you safe in my eyes  
Believe me, my love  
Believe me, my love  
Believe me, my love  
Believe me, my love  
Believe me, my love
