**Translated Lyrics:**

In your eyes, there's dark kohl  
The beauty of a peacock, oh dear  
A false mask on your face  
Yet you still charm me, my dear  
How many have come behind you  
And how many have left, my dear  
Counting them breaks my heart  
Like stars that fall apart, my dear  

**[Chorus]**  
There’s no trust left now, my beautiful one  
There’s no trust left now  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  

**[Verse 1]**  
Your hair is like a net, oh dear  
A divine wrath has struck  
Your eyes are uncontrollable  
They’re like poison, oh dear  
I only ask one thing from God  
For your well-being, oh dear  
What was our fault, tell me  
When you’ve cast away the enemy, oh dear  

**[Chorus]**  
You’ve done wrong without measure, my beautiful one  
You’ve done wrong without measure  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  

**[Verse 2]**  
Your color shines like light  
In the dark night of my heart, oh dear  
Just a little black dot  
Is what I had to say, oh dear  
You’re the one who wears the veil  
I was asking for your company, oh dear  
Come, let’s write together  
Your magic, oh dear  

**[Chorus]**  
It breaks in the middle, my beautiful one  
It breaks in the middle  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  

**[Post-Chorus]**  
This love doesn’t flow anymore  
This love doesn’t flow anymore, my beautiful one  
This love doesn’t flow anymore
