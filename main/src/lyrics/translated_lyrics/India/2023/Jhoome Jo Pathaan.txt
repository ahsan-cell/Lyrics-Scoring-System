**Translated Lyrics:**

You want to love, and I have loved  
Apart from this heart, I’ve sought no one’s permission  

This is also a skill of love, some know it well  
By giving my life, I’ve protected my enemy  

**[Pre-Chorus: Arijit Singh & Sukriti Kakar]**  
We talk in thousands (thousands)  
We have experience, my friends (yes, friends)  
We talk in thousands, we have experience, my friends  
Such is the charm (grace) that I could bind (the air) to me (God)  
May blessings rain down from the heart  

**[Chorus: Arijit Singh]**  
When the Pathaan sways, my love, the gathering will be stolen  
When he speaks, my love, I would die for him  

**[Instrumental Chorus]**  

**[Chorus: Arijit Singh]**  
When the Pathaan sways, my love, the gathering will be stolen  
When he speaks, my love, I would die for him  

**[Refrain: Arijit Singh]**  
Pa dha pa dha ma pa, pa dha pa dha ma pa  
Ga pa ma dha ni ga re sa ga re ma  
Pa dha pa dha ma pa, pa dha pa dha ma pa  
Ga pa ma dha pa ga re ga re sa  

**[Verse 2: Sukriti Kakar & Arijit Singh]**  
How do we compete now, my friend, this time?  
We’ll show you how (we’ll show you how)  
How we fight for our enemy, my friend, this time?  
We’ll show you how (we’ll show you how)  

**[Pre-Chorus: Sukriti Kakar & Arijit Singh]**  
If my friend gives a signal (signal)  
I’d give my heart again (again)  
If my friend gives a signal (I’d give my heart again)  
The intoxication of love (high) is such (captivating)  
That even the enemy would embrace  

**[Chorus: Arijit Singh]**  
When the Pathaan sways, my love, the gathering will be stolen  
When he speaks, my love, I would die for him  

**[Instrumental Chorus]**  

**[Chorus: Arijit Singh & Sukriti Kakar]**  
When the Pathaan sways, my love, the gathering will be stolen  
When he speaks, my love, I would die for him  
When the Pathaan sways, my love, the gathering will be stolen  
When he speaks, my love, I would die for him  

**[Outro]**  
Pa dha pa dha ma pa, pa dha pa dha ma pa  
Ga pa ma dha ni ga re sa ga re ma
