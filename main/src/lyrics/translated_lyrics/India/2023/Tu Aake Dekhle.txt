**Translated Lyrics:**

Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  

[Verse 1]  
People say I'm unfortunate  
Ask me why I'm defeated?  
When love didn't come my way, I turned my heart into a name  
This carefree wanderer  
How does he keep living?  
Look into my fearless eyes, I'm creating a crown  
But in front of you, nothing matters, it's all just ashes  
I'll get lost, so talk to me when we meet  
But in front of you, nothing matters, it's all just ashes  
I'll get lost, so talk to me when we meet  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Because you fit perfectly  
In my eyes  
And in front of you, nothing else stands  
The people of this world  
Don't point out my flaws  
I'll take all your mistakes upon myself  
And these distances will vanish  
New journeys will begin  
Hey hey hey, Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  

[Chorus]  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  

[Verse 2]  
People say I'm wrong  
I hold onto your longing  
But what can I do? Seeing your pictures ignites my desire  
I can't stop myself  
Tears just flow  
I'm not the one who loves anyone else, keeping names apart  
Just talk to me when we meet  
Take care not to hurt my heart a little  
Just talk to me when we meet  
Take care not to hurt my heart a little  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Because you inhabit my memories  
Completely  
And besides you, nothing else feels good  
The people of this world  
Don't point out my flaws  
I'll take all your mistakes upon myself  
And these distances will vanish  
New journeys will begin  
Hey hey hey, Hey hey hey  
Hey hey hey  

[Chorus]  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love  
Come and see for yourself  
Oh, how many nights I've spent  
In your memories, my love  
My love
