**[Verse 1: Jasleen Royal & Arijit Singh]**  
Even my sleep has been shattered, I keep picking stars  
Thoughts of you linger on, my love  
All night long, I recall your memories  
Why hasn’t the morning come yet, my love?  

**[Pre-Chorus: Jasleen Royal]**  
I would die for you, my life and soul  
I would die for you, my life and soul

**[Verse 2: Arijit Singh]**  
Come quickly, my beautiful, let the night not pass  
Come here, come here, my beautiful, let the night not pass  
Come quickly, my beautiful, let the night not pass  
Come here, come here, my beautiful, let the night not pass  

**[Verse 3: Jasleen Royal & Arijit Singh]**  
Whenever I look at you, my eyes give thanks  
Stay close, don’t go far, my love  
Creating a shade with my lashes, I’ll seat you close to my heart  
I’ll shower you with blessings, my love

Yours (my love, yours)  
Yours (my love, yours)

Oh, my precious, oh  
Oh, my precious, oh

My love, yours  
My love, yours
