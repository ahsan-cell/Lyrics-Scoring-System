**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh beloved, you’ve made me yours, there’s no need for anyone else  
With your laughter, you strike me like a bolt of lightning  
Tell me, why do you keep dragging this out?  
That handsome guy, oh girl, what spell has he cast?  
Oh truly, God created you with such beauty  
When did you bring me into your love?  
Those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with your hair and your curls  
You’re completely captivating, my lovely one  

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with your hair and your curls  
You’re completely captivating, my lovely one  

Oh, you come after me every day  
I’m drawn to you like a moth to a flame  
When you pull me in, it’s love that ensnares me  
How can I win with just a glance from your eyes?  

Oh darling, because of you, I’ve lost my senses  
The one who used to point fingers is now running away  
Every time I see you, I forget everything, my fair one

Oh, it’s a mix of emotions, and it tells a story  
My heart wants to gaze at you again and again  
Don’t ever go far from this thought, my dear  
I keep you hidden deep within my heart  

In the letters to friends, it’s only you I mention  
Honestly, I care more about you than myself  
The one who plays the music, oh, he’s not worth it  
I lose to you, my lovely one  

Oh, those eyes, they pierce like a dagger, my fair one  
Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with your hair and your curls  
You’re completely captivating, my lovely one

Oh, when you looked at me, the stars truly shone  
Oh, don’t play with your hair and your curls
