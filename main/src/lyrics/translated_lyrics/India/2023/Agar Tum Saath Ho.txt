**Translated Lyrics:**

Pause for a moment, let my heart find its way  
How can I hold you back?  
Every sorrow that comes my way slips away  

I fill my eyes with you  
I speak to you without words  
If you are with me  
If you are with me  

[Instrumental]  

**[Hook: Alka Yagnik]**  
Like flowing rivers, endlessly  
In your world, there’s my world  
In your desires, I melt away  
In your habits  
If you are with me  

**[Chorus: Arijit Singh]**  
In your eyes lie your dreams  
In your dreams, there’s discontent  
I feel that the matters of the heart  
Are just a deception of words  
Whether you are with me or not, what does it matter?  
Life was cruel, and it remains cruel  

**[Bridge: Arijit Singh]**  
If you are with me  
If you are with me  

[Instrument]  

**[Verse 2: Alka Yagnik]**  
As I blink, these days slip away  
Sitting still, I run around  
Every sorrow that comes my way slips away  
I fill my eyes with you  
I speak to you without words  
If you are with me  

**[Chorus: Arijit Singh]**  
In your eyes lie your dreams  
In your dreams, there’s discontent  
I feel that the matters of the heart  
Are just a deception of words  
Whether you are with me or not, what does it matter?  
Life was cruel, and it remains cruel  

**[Outro: Arijit Singh & Alka Yagnik]**  
If you are with me  
My heart finds its way  
If you are with me  
Every sorrow slips away  
If you are with me  
These days slip away  
If you are with me  
Every sorrow slips away
