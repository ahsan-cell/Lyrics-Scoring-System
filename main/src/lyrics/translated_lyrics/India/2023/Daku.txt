**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1]**
Winter in the distant valley is like a prayer's echo,  
How can I forget a great storm?  
Oh my love, if beautiful dreams end this way,  
Please hold on to the last moment.  
Love will soon be like an unfinished dream.

**[Verse 2: Anh Khang]**  
My life is like a lullaby at dawn's rosy light,  
How can I keep my eyes from shedding tears?  
Who remembers the happiness of two hearts?  
Please keep the wings of the bird from afar.  
Oh dear, don’t deceive me and break my heart.

**[Chorus: Bằng Kiều & Anh Khang]**  
The path of clouds now lacks the footprints of paradise,  
Where can I find the wild garden that holds burning dreams?  
In this new life, do you feel joy?  
Please keep a fallen leaf for me.  
Time now will drift like a sailing boat.

**[Verse 3: Anh Khang]**  
My life is like a song,  
Lulling at dawn's rosy light,  
How can I keep my eyes from shedding tears?  
Who remembers the happiness of two hearts?  
Please keep the wings of the bird from afar.  
Oh dear, don’t deceive me and break my heart.

**[Chorus: Bằng Kiều & Anh Khang]**  
The path of clouds now lacks the footprints of paradise,  
Where can I find the wild garden that holds burning dreams?  
In this new life, do you feel joy?  
Please keep a fallen leaf for me.  
Time now will drift like a sailing boat.

**[Chorus: Bằng Kiều & Anh Khang]**  
The path of clouds now lacks the footprints of paradise,  
The path of clouds now lacks the footprints of paradise,  
Where can I find the wild garden that holds burning dreams?  
In this new life, do you feel joy?  
Please keep a fallen leaf for me.  
Time will drift like a sailing boat.

**[Ending]**  
Time will drift like a sailing boat.
