**Translated Lyrics:**

You are the one I found,  
It feels like God has arrived.  

With such fortune,  
I’ve seen you up close,  
Like rain made of light.  

When you come adorned,  
Before my eyes,  
Let no one else catch my gaze.  

Oh my beloved, how beautiful you are,  
There’s no one like you, nor will there ever be.  
If I were gold, you’d be my treasure, I swear.  

Oh my beloved, how beautiful you are,  
There’s no one like you, nor will there ever be.  
If I were gold, you’d be my treasure, I swear.  

Your meeting is my  
Moonlit night,  
On the paths of love,  
We’ll share our dreams.  

In the sky, there will be a  
Procession of stars,  
The world may search,  
But you will be with me.  

Oh my beloved, how beautiful you are,  
There’s no one like you, nor will there ever be.  
If I were gold, you’d be my treasure, I swear.  

Oh my beloved, how beautiful you are,  
There’s no one like you, nor will there ever be.  
If I were gold, you’d be my treasure, I swear.  

Oh my beloved, how beautiful you are,  
There’s no one like you, nor will there ever be.  
If I were gold, you’d be my treasure, I swear.  

Oh my beloved, how beautiful you are,  
There’s no one like you, nor will there ever be.  
If I were gold, you’d be my treasure, I swear.
