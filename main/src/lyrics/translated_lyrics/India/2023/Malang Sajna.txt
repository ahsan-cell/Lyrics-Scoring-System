**Verse 1**  
I don’t see anyone like you,  
I’ve put my heart on the line, but it doesn’t seem to connect.  
I haven’t found a star in your color, my friend,  
Without you, I’m completely colorless, my beloved.

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
This heart doesn’t agree,  
For you, every moment,  
It keeps wishing for your well-being.

**Chorus**  
You’ve poured a drink into my eyes, coloring me with intoxication,  
In your love, I’ve become a wanderer, my beloved.  
Holding onto your strings, my heart floats in the air,  
Today I soar like a kite, my beloved.  
You’ve poured a drink into my eyes, coloring me with intoxication,  
In your love, I’ve become a wanderer, my beloved.

**[Instrumental Break]**

**Verse 2**  
Love is starting to emerge from behind the curtains,  
It will soon be visible to everyone.  
There’s no one else besides us,  
Our names are written on the pages of love.

**[Chorus]**  
You’ve poured a drink into my eyes, coloring me with intoxication,  
In your love, I’ve become a wanderer, my beloved.  
Holding onto your strings, my heart floats in the air,  
Today I soar like a kite, my beloved.

**[Chorus]**  
You’ve poured a drink into my eyes, coloring me with intoxication,  
In your love, I’ve become a wanderer, my beloved.  
Holding onto your strings, my heart floats in the air,  
Today I soar like a kite, my beloved.

**[Outro]**  
In your love, I’ve become a wanderer, my beloved.
