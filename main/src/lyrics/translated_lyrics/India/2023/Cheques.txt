**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  

[Verse 1]  
Keep an eye out, no enemies in sight,  
The game spins while we’re on the phone tonight.  
No looking back, we’re in the zone,  
Many are burning, but we’re in our own.  
Yeah, it feels like a challenge at dawn,  
Ask around, see where the name is drawn.  
The Jatt’s already set, taking his stand,  
Facing the confusion, time and again, hand in hand.  

[Chorus]  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
(With authority,  
Sitting tight, sitting tight.)  

[Interlude]  
The young man’s swagger is making waves,  
The world speaks up, and the times behave.  
Just look at our status, it burns through the foe,  
Without a doubt, we rise, letting the good times flow.  

[Verse 2]  
The young man’s swagger is making waves,  
The world speaks up, and the times behave.  
Just look at our status, it burns through the foe,  
Without a doubt, we rise, letting the good times flow.  
You don’t leave, it’s all business here,  
Fake plates on the car, but we’ve got no fear.  
Never back down when the pressure’s on,  
Yeah, the face shows it all,  
Don’t ask about the spots, we’re known to stand tall.  
One or two copies, we follow the trend,  
Cooling it down, what a masterpiece we send.  

[Chorus]  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
If there's any doubt, just check it out,  
The Jatt's vibe is rolling with authority.  
Feeling the thrill, big checks in sight,  
Sitting tight with my crew, ready for the night.  
(With authority)  
(Sitting tight, sitting tight.)
