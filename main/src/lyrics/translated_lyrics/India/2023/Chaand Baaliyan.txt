**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Should I look at you or the beauty of nature?  
In difficulties, my heart is troubled  
I admit your face is pure silver, darling  
But the gold of my heart is genuine  

[Pre-Chorus]  
These moonlit curls of yours, they’re like sweet nothings on your lips  
These moonlit curls of yours, they’re like sweet nothings on your lips  
You didn’t give me a chance to think, oh my  

[Chorus]  
I’ve fallen behind you  
Hmm, I’ve fallen behind you  
I’ve fallen behind—  

[Verse 2]  
Your Patiala suit, those Amritsari shoes  
My heart is weak  
Even if your tantrums end, my love won’t fade  
It’s a solid promise from this farmer  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The glances are fighting (ah-ha)  
You pull me in from afar (oh-ho)  
The glances are fighting (yes, indeed)  
You pull me in from afar  
You’re the thread, and I’m your kite, oh my  

[Chorus]  
I’ve fallen onto your rooftop  
Hmm, I’ve fallen behind you  
I’ve fallen behind—
