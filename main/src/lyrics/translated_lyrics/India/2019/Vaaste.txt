**Translated Lyrics:**

For you, I would give my life, I would lose my faith too  
I would change the fate that's written for us  
In return, if God Himself grants you heavens,  
To be honest, I would let it all go  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know nothing more than you, I find myself in you  
I consider you my own, my beloved  
I know nothing more than you, I find myself in you  
I consider you my own, my beloved  

[Chorus]  
For you, I would give my life, I would lose my faith too  
I would change the fate that's written for us  

[Verse 1]  
There’s no other desire left in my heart but you  
Wherever I step, I want to meet you there  
There’s no other desire left in my heart but you  
Wherever I step, I want to meet you there  
For you, my journey exists; without you, where would I go?  

[Pre-Chorus]  
I know nothing more than you, I find myself in you  
I consider you my own, my beloved  

[Chorus]  
For you, I would give my life, I would lose my faith too  
I would change the fate that's written for us  
In return, if God Himself grants you heavens,  
To be honest, I would let it all go  

[Verse 2]  
You are my dawn, you are my shore  
You are my river, my path to God  
This journey of mine begins with you  
And it ends with you, my entire world  

[Chorus]  
For you, I would give my life, I would lose my faith too  
I would change the fate that's written for us
