**Translated Lyrics:**

On your head, my crown will rest,  
I take pride in you as much as you do in me.  
Like Laila, I’ll be renowned,  
And you’ll be famous like Majnu,  
Just wait, this day will surely come,  
Just wait, this day will come.

From moonlight to sunlight,  
That’s where it will scatter,  
In the place where we meet,  
Just watch and see.  
The sky will shatter,  
The earth will melt,  
In the place where we meet,  
Just watch and see.  
The atmosphere will be restless,  
This too will happen, just wait and see.  
In pain, this world will remain,  
This too will happen, just wait and see.  
Yes, this will be,  
Little by little, it will be yours,  
Little by little, it will be my fault,  
I take pride in you as much as...
