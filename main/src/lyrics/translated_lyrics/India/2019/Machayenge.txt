**Translated Lyrics:**

Hey, what's up? What's up?
What is everyone saying?
Emiway Bantai, you know him, right?
We’re going to make a scene
We'll make even those who don’t dance move
Let’s do it
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
If you don’t know, then listen

[Chorus]
They say I’ll become a mama, I’ll turn into Kallu
If you want, I’ll become your pallu (your shawl)
If it’s Malayalam, I’ll be Mallu
If it’s Telugu, I’ll be Allu
If you make me, I’ll be an owl
Baby, not a baba, I’ll be Ballu
To impress a girl, I’ll be Sanju
If it’s about marriage, I’ll be Salu
We’re going to make a scene...

[Verse]
After a long time, a song for a girl
No showing off cars or drinks
This is the way to show love
Strange but still crazy for you
You’re high-class, but
I’m sitting on the low-key vibe, just tell me your name
I’ll slide into your DMs, then from AM to PM
We’ll talk, side by side
Empty house, night after night
Very hard, very hard
You sway and shake as you walk
Distracting my mind
I’ve written something about your moves
I’ll share your wisdom with the public
Oh madam, I’m not your brother
Walk slowly, walk slowly, there’s no rush
I’ll just say this much
You look stunning, mashallah
There’s no doubt about that

What?
