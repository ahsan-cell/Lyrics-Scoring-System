**Translated Lyrics:**

My paths lead to you,  
You are the one I have a right to,  
My love, without a doubt, is you,  
You are the one I have a right to.  

[Chorus: Akhil Sachdeva]  
I won’t leave your side, I’ll follow you,  
I’ll take you by force or ask God to bring you,  
With you, I’ll write our destinies,  
I will become yours,  
I will become yours.  
I swear on your beauty, this promise I’ll keep,  
I’ll fulfill our vows for a lifetime,  
Every time, I’ll make you mine,  
I will become yours,  
I will become yours.  

[Verse: Tulsi Kumar & Akhil Sachdeva]  
For you, I’ve separated from millions,  
You are my destination, my heart is your traveler,  
For you, I’ve distanced myself from millions,  
You are my destination, I am your traveler.  
I’ve forgotten God because of you,  
I have become a non-believer.  

[Chorus: Akhil Sachdeva]  
For you, I’ll collide with the world,  
Losing everything, I’ll find only you,  
As a heart, I’ll make my heart beat for you,  
I will become yours,  
I will become yours.  
I swear on your beauty, this promise I’ll keep,  
I’ll fulfill our vows for a lifetime,  
Every time, I’ll make you mine,  
I will become yours,  
I will become yours.  

[Intro/Outro: Tulsi Kumar]  
My paths lead to you,  
You are the one I have a right to,  
My love, without a doubt, is you,  
You are the one I have a right to.
