**Translated Lyrics:**

**Hook -**  
Impostors are walking right in front of you today,  
Before they strike, you better cut them down.  
They'll dance around you, front and back,  
But don’t listen to their false tales.

**Verse 1 -**  
Old stories, but this flow is brand new,  
On Instagram live, son, now you cry.  
The fame hunger's strong, like a thirsty crow,  
Loosen up a bit, give your career some room.  
It’s falling down like media ratings,  
Your girl’s dating someone else, it’s frustrating.  
Today I’m betting on your career too,  
Hanging by a thread, just like YouTube trends.  
So don’t crowd me, just defend yourself,  
Listening to this song might offend many.  
Their words are incomplete, like snacks with liquor,  
I’m Yo Yo Honey Singh, and this song’s a banger.  
Dance to the music, let your arms sway,  
Will your habits ever change? Don’t say it’s not true.  
I won’t give you this chance again next time,  
So if you’re gonna strike, do it straight and direct.

**Hook -**  
Impostors are walking right in front of you today,  
Before they strike, you better cut them down.  
They'll dance around you, front and back,  
But don’t listen to their false tales.

**Verse 2 -**  
Mumbai has a royal vibe, something unique,  
In two days, I’ll rise above the sky.  
With that speed, I fall wrong here and there,  
I have a passion, they have a thirst for recognition.  
How can I tell you? There’s nothing to discuss,  
Tomorrow you’ll be scared of their words.  
My flow’s so smooth, it makes you go wild,  
Without hard work, you’ll never succeed.  
I’ve come this far, stumbling along the way,  
Your work is big, but you’re still fumbling.  
This nonsense talk, we don’t deal in cheap tricks,  
I got lost in this cycle, caught in the rhythm of intoxication.  
Both the highs and the boys are fake,  
In a year, they’ll turn into Drake.  
Learn from me first, watch my rap,  
Rap is my knife, and your cake is my gang.  
This song’s for my birthday party, get ready,  
Here you’ll find free snacks, twice as plenty.  
So take a little wisdom about being free,  
To put it simply, declare me today.  
Take care today, oh son of your mother,  
You’ll hit it big, I’ll bet on it in two years.  
Scam 1992, my role is like a broker,  
Please shut up, you cheap Deepak.

**Hook -**  
Impostors are walking right in front of you today,

But don’t listen to their false tales.  
Impostors are walking right in front of you today,  
Before they strike, you better cut them down.  
They'll dance around you, front and back,  
But don’t listen to their false tales.
