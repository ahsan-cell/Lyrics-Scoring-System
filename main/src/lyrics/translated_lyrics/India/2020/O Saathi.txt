**Translated Lyrics:**

You turned the storm into the shore for the boat,  
Gathering all the restlessness of the world,  
When nothing else could be made, you shaped my heart.

Oh companion, without you, the traveler sees no path,  
Oh companion, without you, the shore is filled with smoke.

When I close my eyes, who do I seek?  
So that I may not fall asleep, so that I may not fall asleep.  
Who do I search for in these drops of desire?  
So that I may not fall asleep, so that I may not fall asleep.

As if sleep itself is woven away,  
As if sleep itself is woven away.

Oh Allah, you made me capable of pain,  
You turned the storm into the shore for the boat,  
Gathering all the restlessness of the world,  
When nothing else could be made, you shaped my heart.

Oh companion, without you, the traveler sees no path,  
Oh companion, without you, the shore is filled with smoke.
