**Translated Lyrics:**

**Verse 1:**
Oh beautiful, enchanting girl, you captivate my heart,  
No one can match your beauty, that’s for sure.  
I’m your opener, like a cold bottle,  
I could drink you down, sip by sip.

**Chorus: (Tony Kakkar)**  
You’re Coca-Cola,  
You’re a blazing fire.

**Bridge:**  
You are my  
Thirst quencher,  
You are my  
Relief from the day’s fatigue.

**Chorus:**  
You’re Coca-Cola,  
You’re a blazing fire.

**Verse 2: (Young Desi)**  
Hi, check it out,  
You’re Coca-Cola,  
Your charm is overwhelming...  
Oh well, anyway,  
I’ve got something to say:  
It’s time to enjoy the morning,  
I’ve tasted the fruit of the season.  
I tease the dogs,  
I play with the cats.  
I’ve been sitting idle for quite a while,  
The scene was fully on,  
My hair’s all styled,  
I’m dressed up nice.  
After a long wait, I got a call,  
Tony says,  
“Hey, she’s come out!”

**Verse 3: (Tony Kakkar)**  
The first sip you took was a signal,  
What a lovely sight it is!  
I’m feeling thirsty, oh my,  
I’m so thirsty.  
I’ll take half now,  
And save half for later,  
I’ll keep you safe,  
Oh, it’s so hot,  
Ah, it’s so hot!  
Yes, oh my,  
You came in a bikini,  
Not even a bit shy,  
Tonight, the bed will surely break.  
What you gave, I accepted with love,  
Why forget to say, “I love you”?

**Chorus: (Tony Kakkar)**  
You’re Coca-Cola,  
You’re a blazing fire,  
Coca...

**Verse 4: (Young Desi)**  
Look at this, let’s live it up,  
Let’s shake it, black here, black there.  
Miss calls, let’s have some fun,  
What’s up with the black jacket?  
Proud to be from the village,  
Sitting here,  
Girls, my boat is sinking,  
When we rise, we take an oath,  
I don’t say it, everyone else does,  
Coca...

**Outro:**  
You’re Coca-Cola,  
You’re a blazing fire.
