**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]
Her eyes, lined with kohl, are like a beautiful woman’s  
Pulling back, pulling back, she hits her mark straight on  
My little bit of drink feels good today, my love  
Just a little bit of drink feels good today, my love  
Her fair face shines like a beloved's body  

[Chorus 1: Garry Sandhu]  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  

[Verse 2: Garry Sandhu]  
Your mustache makes them tremble  
They’re filing cases in the high court  
Your mustache makes them tremble  
They’re filing cases in the high court  
After eating butter and cream, I’ve become quite the charmer  
After eating butter and cream, I’ve become quite the charmer  
You keep a vibe like a film star  

[Chorus 2: Garry Sandhu]  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  

[Verse 3: Jasmine Sandlas]  
When I speak, it’s like a lit fire, girl  
I go to the gym twice, I’m fully fit, girl  
(I’m fully fit, girl)  
Wherever I go, my name is talked about  
My natural beauty gets all the attention, girl  
(My natural beauty gets all the attention, girl)  

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jasmine Sandlas]  
Your writer Garry roams around like a king  
Your writer Sandhu roams around like a king  
I’m searching for a boy like a book of Shiva  

[Chorus 1: Jasmine Sandlas]  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  
Keeps the boys hanging on a noose  
Oh, my attitude is sharp like a sword  

[Verse 4: Garry Sandhu]  
The fans of my kurta and pajama are fair-skinned  
They’re making noise like the girls from Canada  
(They’re making noise like the girls from Canada)  
Like sugarcane, a swarm of bees follows  
Just like that, they swirl around like the sugarcane fields  
(Just like that, they swirl around like the sugarcane fields)  

[Pre-Chorus 2: Garry Sandhu]  
Today, no one seems tired with anyone  
Today, no one seems tired with anyone  
Now the atmosphere feels like a hunt  

[Chorus 2: Garry Sandhu]  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP  
In the girls' hearts, there’s a beat  
Oh, that boy is like an illegal weapon from UP
