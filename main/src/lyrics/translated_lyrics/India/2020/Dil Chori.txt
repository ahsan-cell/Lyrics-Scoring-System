**Translated Lyrics:**

Hey…

Listen to the story of last night  
I drank old Red Wine  
My friends tried to stop me  
Saying, "Don’t act so stubborn" (x2)

I met a celestial beauty  
She said, "Come closer to me"  
Just tell me this  
Is your heart lost somewhere?

Hey!

My heart has stolen away  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do? (x2)

I got lost in someone’s eyes  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
Oh madam, your walk  
Your silky, silky hair  
What more can I say than this?

I’ve gotten tipsy from the intoxication  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
My heart has stolen away  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
Boys and girls will all come together  
Going crazy when they hit the dance floor  
Everyone will lift the notes  
Zooming in to make a video

All are friends, all are cousins  
Let’s celebrate the pre-wedding festivities  
I’m also looking for that special heart  
For whom my heart beats with passion

Today many relationships will be made  
With those who are exchanging glances  
You too keep your gaze straight on me  
What should I do… 

My heart has stolen away  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
I got lost in someone’s eyes  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
Oh madam, your walk  
Your silky, silky hair  
What more can I say than this?

I’ve gotten tipsy from the intoxication  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
My heart has stolen away  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
(Yo Yo Honey Singh Rap)  
All night, all the drinks  
I’ve pulled it all in  
It’s a friend’s wedding, so come party with me  
Slowly say who will hide their shoes  
Whoever hides them will get a slap  
We need to create an atmosphere beyond super  
Even the aunt and uncle need to dance  
The fun will be in full swing  
Oh, drink up, no one will say anything

At Punjabi weddings, girls are charming  
Drinks flow freely and are shared  
Once the drinks start flowing, they’ll go far  
The caterer will be in trouble

My heart has stolen away  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do? (x2)

I got lost in someone’s eyes  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
Oh madam, your walk  
Your silky, silky hair  
What more can I say than this?  
I’ve gotten tipsy from the intoxication  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  
My heart has stolen away  
Oh, what should I do, what should I do?  

Yo Yo Honey Singh!
