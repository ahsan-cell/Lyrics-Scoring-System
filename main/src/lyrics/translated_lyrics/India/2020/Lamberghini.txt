**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Chorus: Ragini]**  
Driving the Lamborghini, oh,  
Driving the Lamborghini, oh,  
Give us a ride too,  
Where are you going all alone?  

**[Post-Chorus: Ragini]**  
In Model Town, we’re cruising,  
In Model Town, we’re cruising,  
Give us a ride too,  
Where are you going all alone?  
Where are you going all alone?  

**[Verse 1: The DoorBeen]**  
Such a web of love, darling,  
My heart was taken away with you, darling.  
I’ve been following you for a year, darling,  
Please understand, please understand, don’t torment me,  
Don’t torment me.  
With strangers, you talk so sweet,  
This heart of mine is in pain,  
How much you tease me, darling,  
You make me suffer, then  
You speak sweetly again.  
Caught in the car, I’m longing for you,  
Look from afar, darling,  
Look from afar, darling.  

**[Chorus: Ragini]**  
Driving the Lamborghini, oh,  
Driving the Lamborghini, oh,  
Give us a ride too,  
Where are you going all alone?  
Give us a ride too,  
Where are you going all alone?  

**[Post-Chorus: Ragini]**  
In Model Town, we’re cruising,  
In Model Town, we’re cruising,  
Give us a ride too,  
Where are you going all alone?  
Where are you going all alone?  

**[Verse 2: The Doorbeen]**  
Goddamn,  
A million-dollar Lamborghini,  
You look even more expensive than it.  
Goddamn,  
Your TikTok walk is so beautiful,  
Slowly, slowly, you shoot glances at me.  
Goddamn,  
I swear by my God,  
I can’t take my eyes off you, you’re a hunter.  
Goddamn,  
What if I fall in love with you?  
I’ll keep my distance,  
To save myself from heartbreak,  
Your sharp, sharp eyes,  
They pierce right through me,  
Your sharp, sharp eyes,  
I have to stay cautious,  
Oh, those sharp, sharp eyes,  
I have to stay cautious.  

**[Chorus: Ragini]**  
Driving the Lamborghini, oh,  
Driving the Lamborghini, oh,  
Give us a ride too,  
Where are you going all alone?  
Where are you going all alone?
