**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, come on, don’t hold back  
Even the crowd doesn’t care  

Don’t listen to what they say  
With hands raised, my heart dances  
Oh, come on, don’t hold back  
Even the crowd doesn’t care  
Don’t listen to what they say  
I’m just a simple guy  
I can’t find a way  
To handle you, it’s beyond me  
You’re a badass girl  
You create a scene  
Dance, dance in the club  
You make everyone go wild  

She moves it like  
She moves it like  
She moves it like  
She moves it like  

Like a snake, snake  
How many shots have you taken?  
Sometimes to the right, sometimes to the left  
You dance like a serpent  
Somewhere your phone, somewhere your shoes  
A bit feisty, a bit confused  
I find you really charming  
But you’re burning up my fuse  
My heart wants to break news  
I got caught by your pretty face  
I made a mistake, I laughed when I saw you  
Don’t laugh at my situation  
Stay away from me, please forgive me  

You might also like  
The whole world is crazy  
For your moves  
Hands up for the DJ  
You don’t lose your spirit  
Don’t disrespect the crowd  
For your friend’s sake  
Keep dancing  
Don’t lose the key to the car  

She moves it like  
She moves it like  
She moves it like  
She moves it like
