**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro]  
Yes, yes

[Verse 1]  
Look, look, what conversations are happening here  
We’re together, yet not really together  
Is it really that easy?  
Look, look, just like my intentions  
Where were yours, I wonder?  
Yes, how naive I am

[Chorus]  
Apart from my beauty, can’t you ask for my heart too?  
Oh, in a moment I could melt away, yes  
Don’t do this, so that our hearts can’t reconnect  
I could scatter with your words, yes

[Verse 2]  
I admit, the world is crazy  
That’s why you didn’t understand  
I’m enough for you  
Look, look, after getting tired of this world  
Why do you come pretending to be innocent?  
What am I to you? (Yes)  
Why do you come here to make it rain in your eyes?  
If you come, then stay a while  
And don’t hesitate to ask about my day too  
Just with that, I could gather myself, yes

[Post-Chorus]  
Yes, one day, someday  
When someone reads your story  
I feel that my name  
Will never be mentioned anywhere

[Bridge]  
Yes, I’m right here  
Look into my eyes, see  
See the state of my heart  
It can’t be expressed by my lips  
Look into my eyes, see  
What a fate I have  
Even when we meet, I don’t find you  
Look into my eyes, see  
Your incomplete loyalty  
I ask, I plead, and still  
Look into my eyes, see

[Outro]  
Look, look, what drawn lines there are  
Even if you want, the heart still doesn’t win  
I’m not in this race  
Look, look, what conversations are happening here  
These are the words I see wherever I go  
I’m not part of this era
