**Translated Lyrics:**

I will remember this betrayal, my friend  
Only loneliness has touched my longing hands  

**[Pre-Chorus: Vishal Mishra]**  
I will convince my heart  
I will convince my heart, you keep your thoughts safe  

**[Chorus: Vishal Mishra]**  
"Do not grieve for the plight of the poor,  
The heart is a wretched one in separation.  
Whose heartbeat do you hear?  
Is it your heart or our heart?  
Whose heartbeat do you hear?  
Is it your heart or our heart?  

**[Chorus: Shreya Ghoshal]**  
"Do not grieve for the plight of the poor,  
The heart is a wretched one in separation.  
Whose heartbeat do you hear?  
Is it your heart or our heart?  
Whose heartbeat do you hear?  
Is it your heart or our heart?  

**[Instrumental-break]**  

**[Verse 1: Vishal Mishra & Shreya Ghoshal]**  
How do we mend a broken heart, keep telling me?  
Just give us a reason to stay alive.  
Don’t turn away, keep meeting my gaze,  
Make some promise, leave a prayer behind.  

For me, just a little...  
For me, just keep a little space in your heart.  

**[Interlude: Shreya Ghoshal]**  
If your happiness lies in this,  
Then I will hide my tears.  
If the world asks why,  
We’ll just make an excuse.  

**[Hook: Vishal Mishra]**  
"Whatever you want, may you have it," this is my plea.  
Living without you, my friend, would mean being ruined.  
Until we die, we wait for that moment,  
That’s all I had to say.  

**[Pre-Chorus: Vishal Mishra]**  
In fate, our togetherness...  
In fate, our togetherness was only meant to be this far.  

**[Chorus: Vishal Mishra & Shreya Ghoshal]**  
Whose heartbeat do you hear?  
Is it your heart or our heart?  
Whose heartbeat do you hear?  
Is it your heart or our heart?
