**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
My dear, may your story mention me,  
In your silence, may there be concern for me.  
Wherever your face turns, let it be towards me,  
This journey only reaches as far as your embrace.

[Chorus]  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
You have a claim on my loyalty,  
Oh, beloved, my beloved.

[Chorus]  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
Look, I am yours until the end of time,  
Look, I am yours until the end of time.

[Verse 2]  
Let the words flow, let them stay in your arms,  
There is peace within them.  
Those paths are strangers, those tales are false,  
You are not part of them.

[Verse 3]  
Oh, thereâ€™s a little time, but my love is vast,  
How can I tell you, all this will be yours?  
I have to surrender myself to you.

[Pre-Chorus]  
On sighs, on embraces, on paths, on shelters,  
On sighs, on embraces, on breaths, on whispers,  
You have a claim on my love,  
Oh, beloved, my beloved.

[Chorus]  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
Look, I am yours until the end of time,  
Oh, beloved, my beloved.

[Chorus]  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
Oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved, oh, beloved,  
You have a claim on my loyalty,  
Look, I am yours until the end of time.

[Post-Chorus]  
Look, I am yours until the end of time,  
Look, I am yours until the end of time,  
You have a claim on my love,  
Look, I am yours until the end of time.

[Outro]  
Oh, beloved,  
Beloved, oh,  
Oh, beloved, oh.
