**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Verse 1: Unknown]**
Here in Jodhpur, young voices rise,  
All my brothers, let’s ignite the rap fire.  
When the beat drops, no one can match,  
Marwadi boys, we’re not here to back down.  
This is my own game, my own lane,  
Gang gang, we’re going insane.  
Just need a pen, stepping into fame,  
Still, my brother, the vibe remains the same.  
I don’t talk too much,  
Let’s light up the scene, lock it down.  
We wear Rolex, not G-Shock,  
My block is where I rock (Praaa).

**[Verse 2: Eklavya]**  
I don’t overdo it,  
Remember those nights under the acacia tree.  
I decided to make this song,  
People talk a lot, but I don’t need feedback.  
You’re a hit like a festival,  
You have no other option,  
Your moves are always on point.  
Pulling off a little scam,  
Everyone thinks I’m the big bull.  
Rajasthan hip-hop is on fire,  
Everyone now sings in unison,  
In Jodhpur,  
Hip-hop plays,  
It’s the reason we live,  
Hip-hop is our cause,  
This beat is sick,  
Together we win.

**[Verse 3: Roar B]**  
Jodhpur - Marwad,  
A beloved present, a history full of blood.  
Songs play, cars race, my brothers sit beside me.  
Here, kids learn values, stepping out from home,  
Old age gives advice like a bidi.  
We have the high of living, never get angry,  
Rodtang, my brother, when it’s two against two...  
Heyyy, don’t meet our eyes.

**[Verse 4: Hamsa]**  
With a pen, I write dreams, filled with wounds, no complaints,  
When the blue city roars, even the clouds fear, it’s a different thirst.  
Real lions are here, OG material is crushed,  
There’s a flame in my heart that burns, and blood in my veins that doesn’t belong to anyone.  
The people here are neither foreign nor local,  
They ask why you want to be a foreigner?  
These vibes, you stay quiet, but speak up, they’ll call you out.  
Taking a puff, we’ll fulfill our dreams, we’re passionate.  
We have a mansion, come visit, we’re true Marwadi boys, we give and take.

**[Verse 5: Jagirdar RV]**  
No money found on the street,  
Oh, it’s a gift for my grandfather.  
Don’t change what you say,  
Write it in iron, keep your promises.  
I keep accounts, no debts,  
When the beat drops, my friends are there.  
You too, be careful, my friend,  
But ask before you come to my father.  
At sixteen, blood was hot, first time in Makrana,  
Daily hustle, full of shamelessness, every place has its own story.  
The police know, they’ve seen it all,  
Trembling, everyone comes to my house to apologize.

**[Verse 6: BSB]**  
My chest is full of many burdens,  
I work with passion, I don’t lose my focus.  
Slowly moving forward, with family’s support,  
Home fills with my mother’s blessings.  
A Jodhpur guy needs spicy food and buttermilk,  
Working hard all day, at night I need a bed to sleep.  
We unite when someone is in trouble,  
Then we clean up the mess with justice.

**[Verse 7: Avi X]**  
Up and down, we roam around,  
Brother, I’m doing this on a dark night.  
Tell me who’s not here,  
I’m the Marwadi boy,  
I’ll settle the scores,  
I’ll take care of your issues.  
I’ll swing you around,  
Call out to Inder ji,  
I’m notorious for a reason,  
That’s why I’m infamous.  
I’ll tear apart your pride,  
Avi X from Mandore.

**[Verse 8: PK Nimbark]**  
This city is mine, Jodhpur,  
People come here, enjoying life to the fullest.  
Laughter and happiness, everyone mingles,  
With a heavy vibe, zero arrogance.  
Sit down, don’t hate,  
I bring a message of unity, brother.  
Yeah, great, you with a smile,  
Our whole gang is high profile.  
Historical culture,  
Marwadi lifestyle,  
I don’t
