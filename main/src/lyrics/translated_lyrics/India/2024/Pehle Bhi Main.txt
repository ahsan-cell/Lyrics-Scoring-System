**Translated Lyrics:**

[Chorus]  
I've met you before,  
But it felt like the first time we connected.  
You touched my wounds,  
And placed a balm on my heart.

[Pre-Chorus]  
We're a little crazy,  
Both like clouds,  
Let’s pour down, get drenched, come a little closer.

[Chorus]  
I've met you before,  
But it felt like the first time we connected.  
You touched my wounds,  
And placed a balm on my heart.

[Instrumental-break]

[Verse 1]  
What’s wrong, what’s right, I don’t really know,  
If you know, please let me know.  
I’ve been a bit lost from myself for a while,  
If I meet you, please let me know.  
Don’t lose sight of me while you’re watching.

[Verse 2]  
You are the means, you are the destination,  
Or is my heart just that clear?  
You touched my wounds,  
And placed a balm on my heart.

[Pre-Chorus]  
We're a little crazy,  
Both soaked like clouds,  
Let’s pour down, get drenched, come a little closer.

[Chorus]  
I've met you before,  
But it felt like the first time we connected.  
You touched my wounds,  
And placed a balm on my heart.
