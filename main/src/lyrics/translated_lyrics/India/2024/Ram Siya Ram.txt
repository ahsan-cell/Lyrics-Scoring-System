**Translated Lyrics:**

[Verse 1]  
Yes, the search of lifetimes reveals,  
From Ram we walk, to Ram we yield.  
Love, we know not any other,  
With Ram we quarrel, with Ram we discover.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
The sorrowful tale of Ram and Sita,  
One is sandalwood, one is water.  

[Chorus]  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Verse 2]  
Hari is endless, the tales of Hari are infinite,  
In many ways, all saints speak and listen.  
Whoever finds the jewel of Ram,  
Will sing the Ramayana throughout their life.  

[Pre-Chorus]  
A home of auspiciousness, dispeller of inauspiciousness,  
Come, O Sudharsan, the one who dwells in the forest.  

[Chorus]  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  

[Instrumental Break]  

[Outro]  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!  
Ram, Sita-Ram, Sita-Ram, glory to Ram!
