**Translated Lyrics:**

[Intro: Sarkodie and Castro]  
Yeah  
The people behind you, don’t let them be the only ones for me, oh  
Go!  
Everyone gather their collection (yeah!)  
Everyone gather their collection (now!)  
Somebody gather their collection (what else?)  
Let’s go (ha!)  
Everyone gather their collection (yeah!)  
Everyone gather their collection (come on)  
Everyone gather their collection (now!)  
Kokokokokoo, let’s go  

[Verse 1: Sarkodie]  
Listen  
I won’t let anyone be a burden to you  
All the troubles they bring, don’t let them weigh you down  
You’re your own enemy, stop letting them win  
Let’s help each other rise and not fall  

[Chorus: Castro]  
Hey, when you come in  
Everything is in order  
What Nana God has said will surely come to pass, oh  
When you lift your hands  
The waves will part  
So tell your friend not to lose guard  
Put your heart at ease  
Everybody sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Everybody sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Let’s sing ooh (oyaaya)  
I say help me sing ooh (oyaaya)  

[Verse 2: Sarkodie]  
Ah, you thought I wouldn’t notice  
Look, I went away but now I’m back  
Just a little patience, I’m here now  
They say I’ve been gone too long  
Look, your eyes are on death  
Hmm, you thought I’d be a fool  
Look at yourself, and see how you shine  
Now you want to put me down  
But who do you think you are?  
Hehe, Nana God’s hand is upon me  
Hmm, now you’re feeling my presence (yeah!)  
Back then they said I was just a nobody  
If you’re also saying something  
Shame on you too!  
Now you see that I’ve come back strong  
Look at me, I’m moving like a monkey  
If I check, I see you’re hungry  
If you’re doing well, why are you still in the shadows?  
I’m not dead, I’m just living in God’s grace  
You and I are not the same, everyone has their world  
Back then I was sitting on a bench in Aflao  
Nobody brought a handkerchief to wipe my face  

[Chorus: Castro]  
Hey, when you come in  
Everything is in order  
What Nana God has said will surely come to pass, oh  
When you lift your hands  
The waves will part  
So tell your friend not to lose guard  
Put your heart at ease  
Everybody sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Everybody sing hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Let’s sing ooh (oyaaya)  
I say help me sing ooh (oyaaya)  

[Verse 3: Sarkodie]  
Listen  
You’ve been watching me for ten years  
If I die, it would be a long way back  
Your downfall, this is my payback  
My enemies, you better stay alert  
I won’t curse you, I don’t want to disobey God  
You try to put me in prison (ha!)  
At a time when you have no real reason  
You think of me  
Me and Tigofo are meeting  
Don’t repeat what you’ve said, I don’t want to keep going  
It’s God who protects me, so don’t be foolish  
Money isn’t a problem, that’s my motto  
Look at your body and see how it shines next to me  
I won’t let you take my joy  
Tomorrow I’ll be shining bright  

[Verse 4: Castro]  
You who created the heavens and the earth  
Because of your deeds, we call you Adonai  
You’ve done so much for me and my family  
And because of all I see, I won’t lie  
You who created the heavens and the earth  
Because of your deeds, we call you Adonai  
You’ve done so much for me and my family  
So when you die, you die  
God, oh, you’ve blessed me and lifted me up  
I say God, oh  
I can’t forget to bow down before you, oh  
Father God, oh  
You’ve done great things for me, thank you, Father  
Father God, oh  
It’s by your grace that I stand here today  
Father God, oh  
Father, you are too much, oh, Father  
Father God, oh  
Father, you are too much, oh, Father  
Father God, oh  
Father, you are too much, oh, Father  
Father God, oh, Father God, oh, Father God, oh  
Father God, oh
