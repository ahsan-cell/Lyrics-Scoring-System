**Translated Lyrics: "Panya"**

[Pre-Chorus: Tekno]  
I'm singing this song for Panya  
And I'm dancing the dance for Panya, oh  
I will do anything for Panya  
And I'm thanking the Lord for Panya, oh  

[Chorus: Tekno]  
Hey, what is my baby’s name?  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
Hey, what is your baby’s name?  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
I’m crazy for my baby girl  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
Panya, shake the floor for me  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
Eh eh eh!

[Verse 1: Vast]  
Do you know my baby, oh?  
Her name is Panya  
That girl is an African lady, oh  
Eh, Panya  
Oh, Panya drives me insane  
Beautiful lady, oh  
That girl is an African lady, oh  

[Pre-Chorus: Vast]

(Anything, yeah)  
And I'm thanking the Lord for Panya, oh

[Verse 2: Tekno]  
She's my fine baby  
Baby, oh, eh  
She's my African lady, eh  
Lady, oh, eh  
Panya sweet like chocolate  
When she comes around  
She’s a heavyweight  
She dances, she moves  
Give me a date  
Baby, oh yes

Hey, what is my baby’s name?  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
Hey, what is your baby’s name?  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
I’m crazy for my baby girl  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
Panya, shake the floor for me  
Panya, Panya, oh Panya  
Eh eh eh!

Are you stupid?
