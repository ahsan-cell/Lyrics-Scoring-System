**Translated Lyrics:**

Yay  
CDQ with Wizzy (Woss!)  
Masterkraft on the beat (wobi)  
Master  
Let’s go (yeah yeah)  

**[Chorus: Wizkid]**  
Are you ready to dance, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
Wherever you are, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
If you’re feeling good, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
Come on, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started (woss! hey)  
In this life oh  
In this life oh  
Forever and ever oh  
I want to thrive in this life oh (woss! hey)  

**[Bridge: Wizkid]**  
In this life oh hey  
In this life oh  
Forever and ever oh  
I want to shine in this life oh  

**[Verse 1: CDQ]**  
I’ve scored like Ronaldo  
They say Tiwa is here  
They’re all about Eminado  
Wale baby, I’m really big on the scene  
I’m so timeless, let’s party in Monaco  
Yeah yeah  
I’m feeling good  
Timaya knows I’m vibing, I concur  
Tekno says they should wait, don’t rush, just enjoy  
Have I told you I’m feeling your body?  
Your body moves, saying she needs somebody  
What’s the point of it all  
When the body needs someone but is left with nobody (zero profit)  
That means it’s a tough situation  
My mind is racing  
Give me a brain tumor  
Let’s find a way to be together, if you want to, I’ll do more  

**[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid]**  
In this life oh  
In this life oh  
Forever and ever oh  
I want to thrive in this life oh (woss! hey)  
In this life oh hey  
In this life oh  
Forever and ever oh  
I want to shine in this life oh  

**[Chorus: Wizkid]**  
Are you ready to dance, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
Wherever you are, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
If you’re feeling good, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
Come on, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started (woss! hey)  

**[Verse 2: CDQ]**  
Only Tee Billz sees me because I have connections  
Don’t mention my name without reason  
I earn money every day, you won’t retire  
I’m a guy far from hypertension  
Beautiful girl, let’s enjoy  
They’re looking for me in Malay Malay  
Mama Charley, I’m following closely  
CDQ, that’s quality  
They say they’re looking for me again  
They like me in Ghana like Kwame (Kwame)  
Now the whole world feels me  
I’m shining bright, can’t be ignored  
Let’s go  
Don’t hold back, come on, let’s get it started  
The young ones are rising, let’s get it started  
Surulere, come on, let’s get it started  
Mr. DJ, let’s go, keep it going  

**[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid]**  
In this life oh  
In this life oh  
Forever and ever oh  
I want to thrive in this life oh (woss! hey)  
In this life oh hey  
In this life oh  
Forever and ever oh  
I want to shine in this life oh  

**[Chorus: Wizkid]**  
Are you ready to dance, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
Wherever you are, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
If you’re feeling good, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started  
Come on, let’s get it started?  
Let’s get it started (woss! hey)  
Woss!
