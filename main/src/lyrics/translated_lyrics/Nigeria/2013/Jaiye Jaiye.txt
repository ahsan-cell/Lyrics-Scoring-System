**Translated Lyrics:**

Arararara  
Ororororo  
Yaga  
As you can see (Oh yes)  
You are all very welcome (Very very welcome)  

**[Verse 1: Wizkid]**  
I want to provide for my mother  
I want to take care of my father  
Life is in Miami  
Maserati for my wife  
Ferrari, Versace  
Ferragamo, Bugatti  
Money tastes sweet like this  
I want wealth like Adenuga*  
I want to love Esosa  
Ngozi, so beautiful  
All of them for me  
And Tee baby now  
You cannot believe what I have seen with my eyes  
Say my people, it’s a beautiful story (Na na na)  
See, I fought through defeat, now I’m living a better life  
And I’m thankful for the life that I am living (Nuh nuh)  

**[Hook: Wizkid]**  
Wizzy baby, up high  
It’s God who has done it  
Money is coming in  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
Lagos today and London tomorrow  
It’s God who has done it  
Child of enjoyment  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
Wizzy baby, up high  
It’s God who has done it  
Money is coming in  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
Lagos today and London tomorrow  
It’s God who has done it  
Child of enjoyment  
It’s God who has done it, oh ah  

**[Verse 2: Wizkid]**  
I’m balling, I’m balling  
I’m balling for two  
Let nobody do me wrong or intrude  
See, I’m balling, I’m balling  
I’m balling for two  
Let nobody do me wrong or intrude  
Wizzy, bad musician  
Sarz, bad producer  
Ahhh, you already know  
We run every show, oh oh  
Big money is coming in (Amen)  
We will not lack (Amen)  
Maserati, Ferrari (Amen)  
Ferragamo, Bugatti (Amen)  
Big money is coming in (Amen)  
We will not lack (Amen)  
Maserati, Ferrari (Amen)  
Ferragamo, Bugatti (Amen)  

**[Hook]**  
Say Wizzy baby, up high  
It’s God who has done it  
Money is coming in  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
Lagos today and London tomorrow  
It’s God who has done it  
Child of enjoyment  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
Wizzy baby, up high  
It’s God who has done it  
Money is coming in  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
Lagos today and London tomorrow  
It’s God who has done it  
Child of enjoyment  
It’s God who has done it, oh ah  

**[Verse 3: Wizkid]**  
Yaga  
If you call her a woman, an African woman won’t agree (She’ll say "I’m a lady")  
If you call her a woman, an African woman won’t agree (She’ll say "I’m a lady")  
She’ll say I’m a lady  
It’s God who has done it  
She’ll say I’m a lady  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
She’ll say I’m not a woman  
It’s God who has done it  
She’ll say I’m a lady  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
She’ll say I’m a lady  
It’s God who has done it  
She’ll say I’m a lady  
It’s God who has done it, ah  
She’ll say I’m not a woman  
It’s God who has done it  
She’ll say I’m a lady  
It’s God who has done it, ah
