Hm, “Hmm”

[Pre-Chorus]  
This body you’ve given me makes me want to do  
Want to do like a lion, oh like a lion, oh like a lion  
Sasha, give me that spice, it makes me want to do  
Want to do like a lion, oh like a lion,  
Like a lion

[Chorus]  
Don’t go acting all corny, my baby, oh  
Acting all corny, my baby, oh  
Acting all corny, aww (Baby, oh)  
Don’t go acting all corny, my baby, oh  
Acting corny, my baby, oh  
Acting all corny, aww

[Verse 1]  
Girl, I’m like a car, revving up my desire  
Oh, my love, you’re stirring my body, oh  
Marry me, girl, this isn’t a joke, aww (Aww)  
It’s a miracle, come and test my love, oh  
I’ll take you home, come meet my mother, oh  
You’re the one igniting my body, aww (Aww)  
I’m feeling so good  
This feeling is sweet in my body  
Ahh, darling, you’re my joy  
Oh, my honey, ahh  
Sweeter than curry

You’re making my body tingle, oh  
You’re making my… (Come on!)

Want to do like a lion, oh like a lion,  
Like a lion

This body is a miracle, uhh  
Your body is a miracle, uhh  
Baby, you’re a miracle, uhh  
Even iron men are falling for you
