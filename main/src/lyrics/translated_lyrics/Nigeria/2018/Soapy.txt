**Translated Lyrics:**

Oh, it’s time to dance
Yahoo is the priest (Yahoo is the priest)
Everyone is a thief
Whoever is from the land, I’m dancing in the masquerade
(Masquerade, masquerade, masquerade)
I’m dancing in the masquerade

[Verse 1]
Oh, it’s time to dance (Oh, it’s time to dance)
Yahoo is the priest (Yahoo is the priest)
Everyone is a thief
Whoever is from the land, I’m dancing in the masquerade
You want to give me a blessing (You want to give me a blessing)
I have no medicine, but I have the Quran (I have the Quran)
I’m here praying
As I’m praying, Allah is accepting my prayers (Allah is accepting my prayers)
We’ve come and we’ve arrived (We’ve come and we’ve arrived)
Whoever has a good head will prosper (Whoever has a good head will prosper)
Whoever goes will return
The time I return, I’ll be crowned (I’ll be crowned)
Let the crown fit on my head (Let the crown fit on my head)
Let the shoes fit on my feet (Let the shoes fit on my feet)
Let my enemies not disturb my path
Let those [unknown] not disturb my path

[Bridge]
In this life, you’ve seen Five Alive (You’ve seen Five Alive)
In this life, you’ve seen Deeper Life (You’ve seen Deeper Life)
In this life, some are suffering, some are enjoying life (In this life)
In this life, some are praying, some are living beautifully

Money is heavy, you’re just playing with Naira (You’re just playing with Naira)
A dog wants to cross the river
A small cat doesn’t know how to lead a dog (Doesn’t know how to lead a dog)
They’re calling us, don’t run away, they don’t want trouble (They don’t want trouble)
I just want to make mama proud (I just want to make mama proud)
They want to make mama cry (They want to make mama cry)
Mama, you won’t cry anymore
If you’ve cried too much, you’ll cry tears of joy (You’ll cry tears of joy)
