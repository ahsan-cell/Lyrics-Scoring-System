**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Refrain]**  
Let me go, let me go-go-go  
Let me come  
Let me give her the go-go-go  
Your body is so fine  
Let me go-go-go  
Onome has it—  
Ah  

**[Verse 1]**  
What do you want, girl, to eat a banana, aha  
Beautiful and charming, aha  
Come and tell Folake, aha  
Move it, girl, ah  
Just feel your body moving, aha  
If it’s like that, then it’s good, aha  
If we’re together, what do you want, aha  
Move it, oh my lady, oh  
Tell me what’s going on with your body, oh  
Girl, my sweet baby  
Why do you want to come give me cravings? Oh  
If you want it, girl, I’m ready  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Baby, let me take care of you  
Pretty one, what do you want?  
I will take care of you  
Pretty one, what do you want?

Dumebi, dumebi  
Look at me, I see the beauty  
Eh, dumebi

Come see the beauty, oh baby oyoyo

Shaking, ah

Pretty girl  
Don’t go acting all cute like this, oh  
If I hear something, I’ll get upset, oh
