I’m Anita Baker, you’re ‘Ana Shashanigga’  
Let me be free; let’s dance like Shina Peters  
Good times have come, I want to vibe with a higher dude  
God hears! You are my only true love  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Standing strong (standing strong)  
Give me your heart (give me your heart)  
Your body is irresistible, baby come close (Your body, my baby oh)  
My body is calling, baby feel the heat (Oh yeah)  
Baby, turn up the fire (Oh yeah)  

[Chorus]  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
(Ye!)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Teni  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
I’m the girl who’s on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  

[Bridge]  
Girl on fire, askamaya  
Allen Avenue is where you’ll find us  
Girl on fire, askamaya  
Allen Avenue is where you’ll find us  

[Verse]  
I’m the girl you shouldn’t mess with  
Chilling with the boys, don’t play it dull  
What?  
Tell me, are you done messing around?  
I’m the only one, you shouldn’t mess with me!  
Listen, I’m the girl you shouldn’t mess with  
Chilling with the boys, no dull moments  
I’m just here, and I’m turning it up  
Teni, I want to vibe, I’m turning it up  

[Pre-Chorus]  
Standing strong (standing strong)  
Give me your heart (give me your heart) (tee)  
Your body is irresistible, baby come close (Your body, my baby oh)  
My body is calling, baby feel the heat (Oh yeah)  
Baby, turn up the fire (Oh yeah)  

[Chorus]  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
(Ye!)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Teni  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
I’m the girl who’s on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  

[Bridge]  
Girl on fire, askamaya  
Allen Avenue is where you’ll find us  
Girl on fire, askamaya  
Allen Avenue is where you’ll find us  

[Chorus]  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
(Ye!)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Teni  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)  
I’m the girl who’s on fire (aaah)  
Girl, you’re on fire (aaah)
