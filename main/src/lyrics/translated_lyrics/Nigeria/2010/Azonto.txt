**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro: Meron]**  
To all my real drug dealers  
Hello lady, really nice to meet you (Hello)  
I got some friends and they really want to see ya  
Devil in the dress, got the coke with the Nina  
Nina, and it goes with the Beamer  
Man's cleaner, tracksuit Adidas  
'Til you see the hood coming from my team, ah  
'Til you see the bands coming down my G's now  

**[Verse 1: Meron]**  
Girl, what's your problem?  
Let me solve them  
You ain't gotta worry  
I'm a starboy  
Chocolato, you can taste that envy  
They can't take care of you  
They can't take care of boo, nah nah  
They ain't ready for you  
Tell 'em boys go back to school  
Boy, they ain't ready for the leagues  
They ain't ready for your dream  
'Til everything goes, they ain't always gonna gleam  
Keep it real, no weave  
See, I don't like fakeness  
No talk, I don't make no statements  
Bloodclaat, why you makin' the payments?  
Bloodclaat, why you being a paigon?  
I don't rate them, I don't rate you  
Badman with the bars, come and see you  
He's talking funny, but I don't hear voodoo  
What we've got, yeah, I cut right through you  
Right through, yeah  

**[Bridge: Meron & Donyanah]**  
(Who you with?)  
I'm with Nina  
(Is she thick?)  
She's a ten  
(Does she spit?)  
Emptying magazines  

**[Hook: Meron]**  
Nina, Nina, Nina  
Nina, Nina  
Nina, Nina, Nina  
Na na nay nay  
Na na nay nay  
Nina, Nina, Nina  
Nina, Nina  
Nina, Nina, Nina  
Na na nay nay  
Na na nay nay  
Nina, Nina, Nina  

**[Verse 2: Donyanah]**  
I can be antisocial  
How you move in slow motion, I become abnormal  
Do you want to be my darling?  
I can feel your frequency  
You make me dance like azonto  
Like I had a million in my account  
You make me dance like azonto  
Like I had a million in my account  
I swear that you are wavy (yeah)  
Spotlight on the daily (yeah)  
How you move, you amaze me (yeah)  
Your gaze drives me crazy  
You’re mad, and I don’t understand anything  
I swear when you're angry, you're just sexy  
I fall into a trance  
Let them watch when I stop for a dance  
I feel it constantly, there's something special with you  
Always been lowkey, but now I'm after you  
After the club, calling you up  
Do you want to do something wild with me?  
Maybe you think it's strange of me  
But it's up to you  
If she's fine and she knows there's trouble (trouble)  
Mix ice with my drink, it's bubbles (bubbles)  
I don't think you understand, baby  
You gotta give me something, baby  
Ajajaj, yeah  
I swear that you are ajaj, yeah  
Ajajaj, yeah  

**[Bridge: Meron & Donyanah]**  
(Who you with?)  
I'm with Nina  
(Is she thick?)  
She's a ten  
(Does she spit?)  
Emptying magazines  

**[Hook: Meron]**  
Nina, Nina, Nina  
Nina, Nina  
Nina, Nina, Nina  
Na na nay nay  
Na na nay nay  
Nina, Nina, Nina  

**[Outro: Meron & Donyanah]**  
(Ajajaj, yeah)  
(I swear that you are ajaj, yeah)  
(Ajajaj, yeah)  
(Nina, Nina, Nina, Nina, Nina)  
(Na na nay nay)  
(Na na nay nay)  
(Nina, Nina, Nina)
