**Translated Lyrics:**

**[Intro]**  
That's how it is, that's how it is, that's how it is  
Kiss Daniel  
G-Worldwide  
Yeah  

**[Verse 1: Kiss Daniel]**  
It's not you I brought here  
But it's you I will take away, oh oh  
Sisi Agbarigo, eh yeah  
You know  
It's not you I'm checking on  
But it's you I want to know, know, know, know, know  
Sisi Ferrari, oh, eh yeah  

**[Pre-Chorus: Kiss Daniel]**  
Very sweet  
Very nice  
Baby, you’re the one  
It’s really tight (it’s really tight)  
Do you know you’re sexy?  
Don’t think too much, just come close  
I know you’re here to have fun  
You want to show off for me  

**[Chorus: Kiss Daniel]**  
Look over here  
Le le le le le le le  
Baby, don’t look away  
Le le le le le le  
Don’t look away  
Girl, come closer, le le le le le  
Baby, don’t look away  
La la oh oh  

**[Verse 2: Tiwa Savage]**  
Handsome boy, look over here  
Don’t turn your eyes away  
'Cause the more you look at it, the less you’ll see, don’t forget  
Ah, it’s real  
Getting money like Rihanna  
Seeing the future, Ciara  
Nothing will stop me, never  
If you’re going to love me, then love me gently  
If you’re going to hold me, please hold me gently  
I’m very sweet  
Very nice  
If you check my bank account, life is good  

**[Chorus: Kiss Daniel, Tiwa Savage, Davido]**  
Come on, look over here (look over here)  
Le le le le le le le (le le le le le le le le)  
Baby, don’t look away (look over here)  
Le le le le le le (come on, look over here)  
Don’t look away (look over here)  
Girl, come closer, le le le le le (O.B.O, baddest!)  
Baby, don’t look away  
La la oh oh  

**[Verse 3: Davido]**  
I say the love I have for you, I can’t even sing about it  
Your body keeps bothering me in my dreams (see me, see trouble)  
All my guys are asking themselves if it’s really this sweet  
Come on baby, show me something they can’t see  
Eh, very sweet oh oh  
Very nice  
She looks at my neck and says  
It’s really bright  
Forget the nonsense  
Come on, forget the nonsense  
Shake it, forget the nonsense  
Dance, forget the nonsense  

**[Chorus: Kiss Daniel, Kiss Daniel & Davido, Davido]**  
Come on, look over here  
Le le le le le le le  
Baby, don’t look away  
Le le le le le le (It's Davido, eh)  
Don’t look away  
Girl, come closer, le le le le le (O.B.O, baddest!)  
Baby, don’t look away  
La la oh oh  

**[Outro: Kiss Daniel, Davido & Tiwa Savage]**  
Sheyman on the mix  
Your boy Kiss, eh (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
So come on, let’s sit down (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
Child of a wealthy man (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
Le le, le le, le le  
Come on, give me a sign (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
Let’s confirm together (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
So we can enjoy the lesson  
Eh, eh (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
Kiss Daniel and Davido (eh, let’s go, let’s go)  
Emperor Geezy, that’s how it is  
Ghetto worldwide, baby
