**Translated Lyrics:**

Tju tju  
Baddest  
Tju  
Ase trap tse ke pina tsako kasi (This trap is my favorite sound)

[Verse 1: Focalistic]  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay  
I can drive you crazy  
I won’t sell out, I’m in the game  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Baddest)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
I can drive you crazy  

[Verse 2: Davido]  
Away now!  
Take me away (Take me away)  
Way far away (Go far)  
Oh yes, far away  
Light me up like Faraday (referring to Michael Faraday, known for his work in electromagnetism)

[Verse 3: Focalistic]  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
Since lockdown  
I’ve got a girl, ten times fine  
Now you’re feeling it  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
I won’t back down  
We’re going to shine  

[Verse 4: Davido]  
The way I'm feeling right now  
Mad over you like Runtown (referring to Nigerian artist Runtown)  
Tell them to calm down  
Ten years and I’m still around  
When they see me, they frown  
But when the girls see me, they bow down  
Shout out to the south  
And Focalistic with the Champion Sound  
Champion sound!

[Chorus: Focalistic & Davido]  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
I can drive you crazy  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay  

[Post-Chorus: Focalistic & Davido]  
Wa wa we we we we we we welele!  
Welele!  
Welele!  
Welele!  
Welele!  
Wa wa we we we we we we welele!  
Welele!  
Welele!  
Kilele (a playful expression)  
Welele!

[Bridge: Davido & Focalistic]  
Away now!  
Away now!  
Tju tju tju tju tju  
Tju tju tju tju tju  

[Chorus: Focalistic & Davido]  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
Indeed, indeed, we’re going to shine  
We’re going to shine  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
I can drive you crazy  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay (Ge ge)  
We say it loud, we’re here to stay  

[Post-Chorus: Focalistic]
