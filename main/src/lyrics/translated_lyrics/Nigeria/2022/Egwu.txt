**Translated Lyrics:**

**Imolenization**  
Give them pressure  
Street orientation  
Imolenization  
Give them pressure  

**[Chorus: Chike & Mohbad]**  
Life, oh life  
Life, oh life  
Life, oh life, oh life  
Uhh uhh  
Uhh uhh  
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh  

**[Verse 1: Mohbad]**  
All my guys are on point  
All my guys are ready to go  
Cover your face like Lagbaja*  
Got the cap but we don’t lie  
TikTok boys keep tapping  
Pastor’s doing his thing, oh oh oh  
Dancing girl, let’s go, oh oh oh  
Feeling good, feeling alive  
Music doesn’t need permission to touch your soul  
Anywhere, anyhow, you know you’ll feel me  
Music doesn’t need permission to touch your soul  
Anywhere, anyhow, you know you’ll feel me  

**[Chorus: Chike & Mohbad]**  
Life, oh life  
Life, oh life  
Life, oh life, oh life  
Uhh uhh  
Uhh uhh  
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh  

**[Verse 2: Chike]**  
Awilo Longomba*  
Chiké’s song is a hit  
Mohbad, you’re truly great  
I’m living like no other  
Our music is always on point  
Let’s start this together  
I can’t say it, but you’ll know  
Feeling good, feeling alive  

**[Chorus: Chike & Mohbad]**  
Life, oh life  
Life, oh life  
Life, oh life, oh life  
(Music doesn’t need permission to touch your soul)  
Uhh uhh  
Uhh uhh  
Uhh uhh, uhh uhh
