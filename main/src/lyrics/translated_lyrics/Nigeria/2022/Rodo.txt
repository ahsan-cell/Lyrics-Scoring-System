**Translated Lyrics:**

Leave it on the floor  
Baby, don’t let it linger  
Thank you very much (Thank you very much)  
Let’s go!  
If you give me a reason, mama  
What’s the cost of living really?  
Seeing is believing, indeed  

**[Chorus]**  
Spice me up  
Hot hot hot hot hot hot  
My darling  
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet  
Hold me tight  
Hot hot hot hot hot hot  
My darling  
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet  

**[Verse]**  
Only you are my focus  
Let’s come together, just us two  
Will you ride with me for life?  
If I take you all night  
And say it’s all mine  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Baby, you’re so fine  
You shine like gold  
I’m dressed in Versace  
Every currency like a wealthy man  
For a holiday, let’s go to America  
Pure enjoyment  

**[Chorus]**  
Spice me up  
Hot hot hot hot hot hot  
My darling  
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet  
Hold me tight  
Hot hot hot hot hot hot  
My darling  
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet  

**[Bridge]**  
It’s Kunle  
The dance I did yesterday  
(Keep it going)  
My whole body feels it  
(Keep it going)  
Mama must not hear  
(Keep it going)  
Daddy must not know  
(Keep it going)  
The dance I’m dancing, oh oh oh oh  
(Keep it going)  
My whole body feels it  
(Keep it going)  
Mama must not hear  
(Keep it going)  
Daddy must not know  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
Leave it on the floor  
Baby, don’t let it linger  
Thank you very much  
Let’s go!  
If you give me a reason, mama  
What’s the cost of living really?  
Seeing is believing, indeed  

**[Chorus]**  
Spice me up  
Hot hot hot hot hot hot  
My darling  
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet  
Hold me tight  
Hot hot hot hot hot hot  
My darling  
Sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet sweet
